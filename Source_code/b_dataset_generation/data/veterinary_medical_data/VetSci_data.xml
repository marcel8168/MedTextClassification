Work from the last two decades has finally brought immunotherapy into the forefront for cancer treatment, with demonstrable clinical success for aggressive tumors where other therapies had failed. In this review, we will discuss a range of therapies that are in different stages of clinical or preclinical development for companion animals with cancer, and which share the common objective of eliciting adaptive, anti-tumor immune responses. Even though challenges remain, manipulating the immune system holds significant promise to create durable responses and improve outcomes in companion animals with cancer. Furthermore, what we learn from this process will inform and accelerate development of comparable therapies for human cancer patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>27152315</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Sentinel Animals in a One Health Approach to Harmful Cyanobacterial and Algal Blooms.</Title>	<Abstract>People, domestic animals, and wildlife are all exposed to numerous environmental threats, including harmful algal blooms (HABs). However, because animals exhibit wide variations in diet, land use and biology, they are often more frequently or heavily exposed to HAB toxins than are people occupying the same habitat, making them sentinels for human exposures. Historically, we have taken advantage of unique physiological characteristics of animals, such as the sensitivity of canaries to carbon monoxide, to more quickly recognize threats and help protect human health. As HAB events become more severe and widespread worldwide, exposure and health outcome data for animals can be extremely helpful to predict, prevent, and evaluate human exposures and health outcomes. Applying a One Health approach to investigation of HABs means that lessons learned from animal sentinels can be applied to protect people, animals and our shared environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28435836</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Comparative Diagnostic Features of Canine and Human Lymphoma.</Title>	<Abstract>The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous family of lymphoid malignancies that are among the most common neoplasms of both dogs and humans. Owing to shared molecular, signaling, incidence, and pathologic features, there is a strong framework supporting the utilization of canine lymphoma as a comparative, large animal model of human NHL. In alignment with the biologic similarities, the current approach towards the diagnosis and classification of canine lymphoma is based upon the human World Health Organization guidelines. While this approach has contributed to an increasing appreciation of the potential biological scope of canine lymphoma, it has also become apparent that the most appropriate diagnostic philosophy must be multimodal, namely by requiring knowledge of microscopic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features before establishing a final disease diagnosis. This review seeks to illustrate the comparative similarities and differences in the diagnosis of canine lymphoma through the presentation of the microscopic and immunophenotypic features of its most common forms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Type I DHR are often referred to as "immediate" and involve B lymphocyte-secreted IgE that bind to the membrane of basophils and mast cells, inducing their degranulation. This review presents various in vitro tests that were developed in the field of human type I HS and implemented as clinical diagnostic tools in human cases of immediate DHR. The respective strengths and weaknesses of each test will be discussed in parallel of validation data such as specificity and sensitivity whenever available. Some of them have also been used as diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine, but not in cases of immediate DHR. Most of these diagnostic tools can be categorized into humoral and cellular tests. The former tests measure serum concentrations of factors, such as histamine, tryptase, and drug-specific IgE. The latter assays quantify markers of drug-induced basophil activation or drug-specific lymphocyte proliferation. Pharmacogenetic markers have also been investigated in immediate DHR, but not as extensively as in non-immediate ones. Throughout, practical aspects and limitations of the tests, as well as sensitivity and specificity parameters, will be presented. In addition, the experience of veterinary medicine with these diagnostic tools will be summarized. However, to date, none of them has ever been reported in a veterinary case of type I DHR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Leptospires live in the proximal renal tubules of reservoir or chronic carrier animals, and are shed in the urine. Na&#239;ve animals acquire infection either when they come in direct contact with a reservoir or infected animals or by exposure to environmental surface water or soil that is contaminated with their urine. In this study, urine samples from a herd of donkeys on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts were screened using a TaqMan-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting a pathogen-specific leptospiral gene, lipl32. Out of 124 clinically normal donkeys, 22 (18%) tested positive for leptospiral DNA in their urine. Water samples from two water troughs used by the donkeys were also tested, but were found to be free from leptospiral contamination. Detection of leptospiral DNA in the urine of clinically healthy donkeys may point to a role that these animals play in the maintenance of the bacteria on St. Kitts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Rams were exposed to two months of long days (16 h light/day) and given three melatonin implants at the end of the long days (sexually-activated rams; SAR). Control rams (CR) were exposed to the natural photoperiod. Thirty-six ewes weaned on 25 February were assigned to one of two groups. From 1 March to 30 June, one group was housed with four SAR males (SAR-treated; n = 18), and the other group (CR-treated; n = 18) was housed with four unstimulated rams. Ovulation was assessed once per week based on plasma progesterone concentrations. Estrus was monitored daily by marks left on ewes by rams' harnesses. SAR-treated ewes had a shorter (p &lt; 0.01) weaning-first estrus interval than CR-treated ewes (61 &#177; 17 days vs. 102 &#177; 47 days; mean date of first estrus after weaning on April 26 and June 6, respectively). The proportion of the ewes ovulating in April or May was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the SAR-treated group than in the CR-treated group. SAR-treated ewes resumed estrous activity sooner than CR-treated ewes such that, in April, May, and June, the proportion of females that exhibited estrus was higher (p &lt; 0.01) in the SAR-treated group (72%, 89%, and 100%, respectively) than in the CR-treated group (17%, 44%, and 61%, respectively). In conclusion, the introduction at weaning of sexually activated rams advanced the resumption of estrous activity in ewes in spring. The practical implications of this work could be important in ewes adapted for intensive production and accelerated lambing systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although dietary habits are considered as a major factor contributing to acquired malocclusions, the exact causes and interrelationships are still under debate. In this regard, an important aspect that has not been considered thoroughly to date is the effect of diet-induced phenotypic plasticity in skull morphology. Therefore, we conducted a geometric morphometric analysis on skull radiological images of wild and pet rabbits in order to quantify intraspecific variation in craniomandibular morphology. The statistical analyses reveal a significant morphological differentiation of the craniomandibular system between both groups. Furthermore, the analysis of covariance shows that the force-generating modules (cranium and mandible) vary independently from the force-receiving module (hypselodont teeth) in pet rabbits, which is in contrast to their wild relatives. Our findings suggest that the phenotypic changes in domestic rabbits impact mastication performance and, consequently, oral health. An adequate close-to-nature nutrition throughout the whole life and especially beginning early parallel to weaning (phase of increased phenotypic plasticity) is necessary to ensure a normal strain on the teeth by promoting physiological lateral gliding movements and avoiding direct axial loads.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056665</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Review on Usage of Vancomycin in Livestock and Humans: Maintaining Its Efficacy, Prevention of Resistance and Alternative Therapy.</Title>	<Abstract>Vancomycin is one of the "last-line" classes of antibiotics used in the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Even though vancomycin was discovered in the 1950s, it was widely used after the 1980s for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, as the prevalence of these strains were increased. However, it is currently evident that vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have developed for various reasons, including the use of avaparcin-an analog of vancomycin-as a feed additive in livestock. Therefore, prophylactic and empiric use of antibiotics and their analogues need to be minimized. Herein we discuss the rational use of vancomycin in treating humans, horses, farm animals, and pet animals such as dogs, cats, and rabbits. In present day context, more attention should be paid to the prevention of the emergence of resistance to antibiotics in order to maintain their efficacy. In order to prevent emergence of resistance, proper guidance for the responsible use of antimicrobials is indispensable. Therefore, almost all stakeholders who use antibiotics should have an in-depth understanding of the antibiotic that they use. As such, it is imperative to be aware of the important aspects of vancomycin. In the present review, efforts have been made to discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, indications, emergence of resistance, control of resistance, adverse effects, and alternative therapy for vancomycin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056666</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Comparative Value of Feline Virology Research: Can Findings from the Feline Lentiviral Vaccine Be Translated to Humans?</Title>	<Abstract>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus of domestic cats that shares several similarities with its human counterpart, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Their analogies include genomic organization, lymphocyte tropism, viral persistence and induction of immunodeficiency. FIV is the only lentivirus for which a commercial vaccine is registered for prevention in either human or veterinary medicine. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of protection induced by lentivirus vaccines at the population level and might contribute to the development of efficacious HIV vaccines. As well as having comparative value for vaccine studies, FIV research has shed some light on the relationship between lentiviral tropism and pathogenesis. Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrated that the interaction between FIV and its primary receptor changes as disease progresses, reminiscent of the receptor switch observed as disease progresses in HIV infected individuals. Here we summarise findings illustrating that, in addition to its veterinary significance, FIV has comparative value, providing a useful model to explore lentivirus-host interactions and to examine potential immune correlates of protection against HIV infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia that improved with intravenous fluid therapy. Despite an initial cessation of neurological signs, symptoms re-emerged, and the heifer was euthanized due to poor prognosis. A pituitary abscess (Trueperella pyogenes) was observed on gross necropsy, suggesting that the effects of panhypopituitarism (inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and/or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion) may have resulted in the clinical findings. Pituitary abscess syndrome carries a poor prognosis due to the inability to penetrate the area with systemic antibiotic therapy. These findings highlight the unusual clinical presentations that may occur following pituitary abscess syndrome in cattle that practitioners need to consider when determining prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals who regularly exercise therefore require a well-adapted heart to support this delivery. The purpose of this review is to examine cardiac structure, and the potential for exercise-induced cardiac remodeling, in animals that regularly engage in strenuous activity. Specifically, we draw upon the literature that has studied the "athlete's heart" in humans, horses, and dogs, to enable the reader to compare and contrast cardiac remodeling in these three athletic species. The available literature provides compelling evidence for exercise-induced cardiac remodeling in all three species. However, more work is required to understand the influence of species/breed specific genetics and exercise-related hemodynamics, in order to fully understand the impact of exercise on cardiac structure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report describes a case of squamous cell carcinoma in a northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), with metastases to the draining lymph nodes and lung. This neoplasm consisted predominantly of well-differentiated squamous cells and multifocal keratin pearls, with areas possibly consistent with epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as identified by positive immunohistochemical staining by both pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin. Additional investigations were negative for bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Acute infection of the oro-respiratory tract leads to immune suppression and allows commensal bacteria to infect an otherwise healthy lower respiratory tract. This condition is known as the Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD). BoHV-1 latently infects the host for life and periodical stress events re-initiate BRD, translating into high morbidity and large economic losses. To gain a better understanding of the biology of BoHV-1 and the disease it causes, we elucidated the protein composition of extracellular virions using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. We detected 33 viral proteins, including the expected proteins of the nucleocapsid and envelope as well as other regulatory proteins present in the viral tegument. In addition to viral proteins, we have also identified packaged proteins of host origin. This constitutes the first proteomic characterization of the BoHV virion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Foxp3 is essential to Treg cell function and multiple studies have documented that lentivirus-activated Treg cells exhibit heightened Foxp3 expression when compared to Treg cells from uninfected controls. Our hypothesis was that lentivirus-induced micro-RNAs (miRNAs) contribute to heightened Treg cell suppressor function by stabilizing Foxp3 expression. We demonstrated that CD4[+]CD25[+] T cells from both feline immunodeficiency virus infected (FIV[+]) cats and uninfected control cats exhibit increased miRNA 10a and 21 levels compared to autologous CD4[+]CD25[-] T cells but there was no difference in the levels of these miRNAs when Treg cells from FIV[+] cats were compared to Treg cells from uninfected controls. Further, there was no increase in Foxp3 mRNA following transfection of miRNA 10a or 21 into a feline cell line. However, transfection with miRNA 10a resulted in increased Foxp3 protein expression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has become a threat to public health at large, thus there is a need for definite diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the novel diagnostic marker for the detection of the sub-clinical form of mastitis. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the whey protein fraction of normal and mastitis milk samples revealed the presence of proteose peptone component 3 precursor, Trypsin precursor, complement component-C3, Ig heavy chain precursors and a C-type lectin domain as differentially expressed protein during the early stage of mastitis. Of these proteins identified, complement component-C3 was tested for its diagnostic potential. Western blot analysis of the milk whey of sub-clinical mastitis cases (M+, M++ &amp; M+++) identified the accumulation of C3a, an activated product of complement component-C3. Further, the hemolytic activity of the above milk whey samples positively correlated with the somatic cell count. As C3a is already reported as an anaphylotoxic agent, it chemo tactically attracts lymphocytes at the site of inflammation, the detection of which in the milk whey can be of diagnostic importance for sub-clinical mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The ensuing inflammation and damage give rise to varying degrees of cognitive decline collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Because of the similarities to HIV infection and disease, FIV has provided a useful model for both in vitro and in vivo studies of CNS infection, inflammation and pathology. This mini review summarizes insights gained from studies of early infection, immune cell trafficking, inflammation and the mechanisms of neuropathogenesis. Advances in our understanding of these processes have contributed to the development of therapeutic interventions designed to protect neurons and regulate inflammatory activity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056674</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Awareness of the International Veterinary Profession of Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine and Preferred Methods of Training.</Title>	<Abstract>Evidence-based veterinary medicine (EVM) is an evolving discipline in veterinary medicine so it is important to periodically "benchmark" opinion about EVM across the profession. An international survey to assess veterinarians' awareness of EVM was conducted. Veterinarians were surveyed via an online questionnaire (all countries) or a postal questionnaire (UK only). Participants were asked whether they had heard of EVM, where they had first heard the term, and their preferences of method for receiving continuing professional development (CPD). There were 6310 respondents, of which 4579 (72.5%) worked in the UK and 5384 (85.3%) were clinicians. Veterinarians that had heard of EVM (n = 5420, 85.9%) were most likely to be clinicians (OR = 4.00; 95% CI: 3.37, 4.75), respondents working in the UK (OR = 1.32; CI: 1.13, 1.54), or respondents with a postgraduate degree or qualification (OR = 1.77; CI: 1.51, 2.08). The most common sources from which respondents had heard of EVM were at vet school or university (n = 1207, 29.8%), via literature (peer-reviewed papers or other publications) (n = 1074, 26.5%), and via CPD courses (n = 564, 13.9%). Most respondents were interested in finding out more about EVM (n = 4256 of 6173, 69%). The preferred methods of CPD were day or evening seminars (n = 2992 of 6017, 49.7%), conferences (n = 1409, 23.4%), and online courses (n = 524, 8.7%), although the order of preference differed slightly between groups. There appears to be substantial awareness of EVM amongst veterinarians internationally. However, it appears that further training in EVM would be welcomed. Preferences on how CPD in general is received differs between groups, so this should be borne in mind by training providers when formulating a strategy for the dissemination of EVM training across the global profession.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

FIV-infected cats are at increased risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia and consistently harbor higher FcaGHV1 loads than FIV-uninfected cats. Whether immune deficiencies unrelated to FIV are associated with similar risks is unknown. Using whole blood FcaGHV1 qPCR, we found no difference in the frequency of DNAemia or DNA load in therapeutically immunosuppressed (P1, n = 18) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected (P2, n = 57) patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls (C1, n = 58; C2, n = 57). In contrast, FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats (P3, n = 5) were at increased risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia compared to retrovirus uninfected controls (C3, n = 39; p = 0.0068), and had a higher median FcaGHV1 DNA load, although the latter was not significant. FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats (P3) had a similar frequency of FcaGHV1 DNAemia reported compared to FIV-infected controls (C4). In conclusion, we found no evidence that cats with therapeutic immunosuppression or FeLV infection were at greater risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia or had higher FcaGHV1 DNA load in whole blood. The risk of DNAemia in FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats was similar to that documented previously in cats infected with FIV alone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056676</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serum Fructosamine Concentration in Uncontrolled Hyperthyroid Diabetic Cats Is within the Population Reference Interval.</Title>	<Abstract>Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy of cats that is characterized by persistent fasting hyperglycemia. However, stress induces substantial hyperglycemia in cats that poses a challenge to the veterinarian who may wrongly interpret the high serum concentration of blood glucose as evidence of diabetes mellitus. Fructosamine is a glycated serum protein that serves as an index of glycemic control in cats and is useful because it is not affected by stress hyperglycemia. However, factors such as body weight, hypoproteinemia, and increased serum thyroid hormone concentration can alter fructosamine concentration. The goal of this retrospective study was to compare the fructosamine concentrations in diabetic and nondiabetic cats with and without uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. A secondary goal was to determine the effect of sex, age, different populations of cats, and diabetes on the variability of fructosamine. We found that the mean (&#177;SE) serum fructosamine of hyperthyroid diabetic cats (332 &#177; 24 &#181;mol/L, 95% CI 291-379 &#181;mol/L) was within the population-based reference interval (200-360 &#181;mol/L) and significantly lower in comparison to euthyroid diabetic cats (527 &#177; 10 &#181;mol/L, 95% CI 515-553 &#181;mol/L). Additionally, in this study, diabetes accounted only for approximately 50% of the variance in serum fructosamine, while age, sex, and population made a minor contribution to this variance. In conclusion, finding serum fructosamine that is within the population-based reference interval in an uncontrolled diabetic cat should alert the veterinarian to the possibility of concurrent hyperthyroidism. Additionally, the veterinary clinician should consider that serum fructosamine might be substantially affected by factors other than diabetes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lens opacification occurs primarily through the generation of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, through the action of aldose reductase (AR). The osmotic effect of sorbitol draws water into the lens, causing opacification. Inhibition of AR should thus prevent the generation of cataracts. A topical AR inhibitor has been shown to have this effect, as has the commercially available neutraceutical OcuGLO, containing the AR inhibitor alpha lipoic acid (ALA) together with other plant-based antioxidants. Here a comparison is made between the number of diabetic dogs developing cataracts when given oral ALA alone and those given a mix containing ascorbic acid and tocopherol. Animals given ALA developed significantly fewer lens opacities than those given conventional antioxidants. Cataracts which formed occurred at a significantly greater duration after the commencement of treatment than those on the antioxidant mix. Although this is a small study conducted over a short period, the significant benefit of ALA in diabetic dogs is a reason to evaluate these effects in larger trials. As AR is involved in diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, this enzyme inhibitor may be worthy of evaluation in preventing these conditions in human diabetics also.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This review compares the cardiomyopathies in both human and non-human animals and identifies the genetic associations for each disorder in each species/taxonomic group. Despite differences between species, advances in human medicine can be gained by utilising animal models of cardiac disease; likewise, gains can be made in animal medicine from human genomic insights. Advances could include undertaking regular clinical checks in individuals susceptible to cardiomyopathy, genetic testing prior to breeding, and careful administration of breeding programmes (in non-human animals), further development of treatment regimes, and drugs and diagnostic techniques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Anomalies of coronary artery origin and course are well-recognized in human medicine, but have received limited attention in veterinary medicine. Coronary artery anomalies are best described in the dog, hamster, and cow though reports also exist in the horse and pig. The most well-known anomaly in veterinary medicine is anomalous coronary artery origin with a prepulmonary course in dogs, which limits treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis. A categorization scheme for coronary artery anomalies in animals is suggested, dividing these anomalies into those of major or minor clinical significance. A review of coronary artery development, anatomy, and reported anomalies in domesticated species is provided and four novel canine examples of anomalous coronary artery origin are described: an English bulldog with single left coronary ostium and a retroaortic right coronary artery; an English bulldog with single right coronary ostium and transseptal left coronary artery; an English bulldog with single right coronary ostium and absent left coronary artery with a prepulmonary paraconal interventricular branch and an interarterial circumflex branch; and a mixed-breed dog with tetralogy of Fallot and anomalous origin of all coronary branches from the brachiocephalic trunk. Coronary arterial fistulae are also described including a coronary cameral fistula in a llama cria and an English bulldog with coronary artery aneurysm and anomalous shunting vessels from the right coronary artery to the pulmonary trunk. These examples are provided with the intent to raise awareness and improve understanding of such defects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056680</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Animal Models of Cancer-Associated Hypercalcemia.</Title>	<Abstract>Cancer-associated hypercalcemia (CAH) is a frequently-occurring paraneoplastic syndrome that contributes to substantial patient morbidity and occurs in both humans and animals. Patients with CAH are often characterized by markedly elevated serum calcium concentrations that result in a range of clinical symptoms involving the nervous, gastrointestinal and urinary systems. CAH is caused by two principle mechanisms; humorally-mediated and/or through local osteolytic bone metastasis resulting in excessive calcium release from resorbed bone. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is the most common mechanism and is due to the production and release of tumor-associated cytokines and humoral factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), that act at distant sites to increase serum calcium concentrations. Local osteolytic hypercalcemia (LOH) occurs when primary or metastatic bone tumors act locally by releasing factors that stimulate osteoclast activity and bone resorption. LOH is a less frequent cause of CAH and in some cases can induce hypercalcemia in concert with HHM. Rarely, ectopic production of parathyroid hormone has been described. PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia is the most common mechanism of CAH in human and canine malignancies and is recognized in other domestic species. Spontaneous and experimentally-induced animal models have been developed to study the mechanisms of CAH. These models have been essential for the evaluation of novel approaches and adjuvant therapies to manage CAH. This review will highlight the comparative aspects of CAH in humans and animals with a discussion of the available animal models used to study the pathogenesis of this important clinical syndrome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Many veterinary practitioners believe creating a low stress environment is too hard and too time consuming, but this need not be the case. With some simple approaches, minimising patient, and hence staff, stress is achievable in all veterinary practices. This article provides a background on why minimising stress is important and outlines some practical steps that can be taken by staff to minimise stress for presenting and hospitalised patients. Useful resources on recognising signs of stress in dogs and cats, handling, restraint, behaviour modification, medications, and hospital design are provided.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although heritable factors are known to have a role in cardiovascular disease, the full genetic aetiology remains unclear. Model organism research has proven valuable in providing a deeper understanding of the essential factors in heart development. For example, mouse knock-out studies reveal a role for the Integrin adhesion receptor in cardiac tissue. Recent research in Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), a powerful experimental model, has demonstrated that the link between the extracellular matrix and the cell, mediated by Integrins, is required for multiple aspects of cardiogenesis. Here we test the hypothesis that Integrins signal to the heart cells through Src42A kinase. Using the powerful genetics and cell biology analysis possible in Drosophila, we demonstrate that Src42A acts in early events of heart tube development. Careful examination of mutant heart tissue and genetic interaction data suggests that Src42A's role is independent of Integrin and the Integrin-related Focal Adhesion Kinase. Rather, Src42A acts non-autonomously by promoting programmed cell death of the amnioserosa, a transient tissue that neighbors the developing heart.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056683</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Dissecting the Role of the Extracellular Matrix in Heart Disease: Lessons from the Drosophila Genetic Model.</Title>	<Abstract>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic scaffold within organs and tissues that enables cell morphogenesis and provides structural support. Changes in the composition and organisation of the cardiac ECM are required for normal development. Congenital and age-related cardiac diseases can arise from mis-regulation of structural ECM proteins (Collagen, Laminin) or their receptors (Integrin). Key regulators of ECM turnover include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMP expression is increased in mice, pigs, and dogs with cardiomyopathy. The complexity and longevity of vertebrate animals makes a short-lived, genetically tractable model organism, such as Drosophila melanogaster, an attractive candidate for study. We survey ECM macromolecules and their role in heart development and growth, which are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates, with focus upon the consequences of altered expression or distribution. The Drosophila heart resembles that of vertebrates during early development, and is amenable to in vivo analysis. Experimental manipulation of gene function in a tissue- or temporally-regulated manner can reveal the function of adhesion or ECM genes in the heart. Perturbation of the function of ECM proteins, or of the MMPs that facilitate ECM remodelling, induces cardiomyopathies in Drosophila, including cardiodilation, arrhythmia, and cardia bifida, that provide mechanistic insight into cardiac disease in mammals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fecal samples were collected from 109 dogs between July and August 2008. Cryptosporidium spp. infection was determined by immunofluorescent assay (IFA), PCR assays that amplify Cryptosporidium heat-shock protein 70 kDa (hsp70), and two PCR assays that amplify a small subunit-ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA). Giardiaduodenalis infection was identified using zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation, IFA, and four PCR assays that amplify the Giardia glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), beta-giardin (bg), and generic and dog-specific assays of triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. Overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and G.duodenalis was 31.2% and 45.9%, respectively. Sequence analysis of 22 Cryptosporidium-positive samples and 21 Giardia-positive samples revealed the presence of C.canis in 15, and C. parvum in 7, G. duodenalis Assemblage C in 8, D in 11, and mixed of C and D in 2 dogs. Dogs in Chiang Mai were commonly exposed to Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis. Cryptosporidium parvum can be isolated from the feces of dogs, and all G. duodenalis assemblages were dog-specific. Dogs could be a reservoir for a zoonotic Cryptosporidium infection in humans, but further studies will be required to determine the clinical and zoonotic importance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The current study aimed to investigate the owner population which opts for euthanasia instead of DM treatment. A survey was designed using multiple feedback steps and made available online to veterinarians world-wide. A total of 1192 veterinarians completed the survey and suggested a median one in 10 diabetic pets are euthanased at diagnosis; a further median one in 10 within one year because of lack of success or compliance. Perceived most important motivating factors included "presence concurrent disease" (45% respondents); "costs" (44%); "animal age" (37%); "problems obtaining adequate control" (35%); "pet welfare" (35%); and "impact owner's lifestyle" (32%). Cats in Canadian (odds ratio (OR) 2.7), Australian (OR 2.3), rural (OR 1.6) and mixed (OR 1.7) practices were more likely to be euthanased because of DM diagnosis, while cats presented to referral/university were less likely to be euthanased (OR 0.6). Dogs were more likely to be euthanased because of DM in Canadian (OR 1.8), rural (OR 1.8) and mixed (OR 1.6) practices. The survey results suggest that benefit exists in improved DM education with emphasis on offering a choice of treatment styles ranging from intense and expensive to hands-off and cheap.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This coincided with calving in New Zealand's seasonal dairy farming system and a time when calves with diarrhoea are commonly seen by veterinarians. Laboratory and epidemiological investigations were instigated by MidCentral Public Health Service (MCPHS) in conjunction with the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences (IVABS) at Massey University. Eighty students responded to a questionnaire of which 19 met the case definition, a 24% attack rate. Faecal specimens from seven students contained Cryptosporidium oocysts and Cryptosporidium parvum IIa A18G3R1 was identified from one of the specimens. The inferred median incubation period was five days (range 1-12 days). All of the cases were self-limiting, characterized by diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, and in some cases vomiting, headache, and fever. Having contact with calves with diarrhoea was significantly associated with increased adjusted odds of being a case (OR 10.61, 95% CI 1.87-108.29 for one week of contact; OR 55.05, 95% CI 3.80-1931.18 for two weeks of contact). Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis had occurred previously among veterinary students at Massey University, but the extremely high infectivity of C. parvum resulted in student illness despite enhanced hygiene precautions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred and seventy-four questionnaires were completed. Owner estimated BW was compared to actual BW, correct being defined within &#177;10% of actual BW. Correct interpretation of the total amount of food required was determined by the number of cans (&#177;25% of cans) required for wet food and grams (&#177;20% of grams) for dry food, based on the dog's actual BW, the feeding guidelines on the label, and a comparison with the owner's estimate. Eleven percent of owners overestimated BCS and 19% overestimated BW. Only 48% of owners could correctly estimate their dog's BW. Only 23% and 43% of owners could correctly estimate how much wet and dry food to feed, respectively. Chi-square analysis demonstrated a significant positive association for owners correctly estimating their dog's BW and interpreting the wet pet food label. Many owners are not aware of their pet's BCS and BW and cannot accurately interpret pet food labels. Further owner education to improve these skills is needed if dogs are to be fed correctly.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, eight strains isolated from mullets of the genera Mugil and Liza captured in the Ligurian Sea were characterized, and a method to detect histamine-producing Pdd from fish samples was developed. The histamine-producing potential of the strains was evaluated in culture media (TSB+) using a histamine biosensor. Subsequently, two strains were used to contaminate mackerel fillets (4 or 40 CFU/g), simulating a cross-contamination on the selling fish stalls. Sample homogenates were enriched in TSB+. The cultures were then inoculated on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) and the dark green colonies were cultured on Niven agar. The violet isolates were characterized using specific biochemical and PCR based tests. All Pdd strains were histamine producers, yielding concentration varying from 167 and 8977 &#181;g/mL in TSB+ cultures incubated at 30 &#176;C for 24 h. Pdd colonies were detected from the inoculated mackerel samples and their histidine decarboxylase gene was amplified using species-specific primer pairs designed for this study. The results indicate that mullets can be source of Pdd and the fish retailers needs to evaluate the risk posed by cross-contamination on the selling fish stalls.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056692</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Raw Meat-Based Diets in Dogs and Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>Feeding pets raw meat-based diets (RMBDs) is commonly practiced by many companion animal owners and has received increasing attention in recent years. It may be beneficial for the animals, but may also pose a health risk for both pets and their owners, as RMBDs may be contaminated by enteric pathogens-such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Yersinia-which are the most common zoonotic bacteria causing enteritis in humans. Little information exists on the prevalence of these pathogens in pet food, and thus one aim was to investigate the prevalence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Yersinia in commercial RMBDs from retail stores. Little evidence also exists on the significance of raw meat feeding on the shedding of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Yersinia in the feces of pets, and therefore, the second goal was to study the presence of these pathogens in dogs and cats fed RMBDs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only sporadically detected Campylobacter, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Yersinia in RMBDs. These pathogens were not found by culturing, indicating a low contamination level in frozen RMBDs. They were also detected in the feces of dogs and cats, but the association with feeding RMBDs to them remained unclear.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the case of the dog it is ubiquitous, such that all aged dogs will have some evidence of the disease, and for humans it is known as Barlow's disease and affects up to 3% of the population, with an expected increase in prevalence as the population ages. Disease in the two species show many similarities and while both have the classic myxomatous degeneration only in humans is there extensive fibrosis. This dual pathology of the human disease markedly affects the valve transcriptome and the difference between the dog and human is dominated by changes in genes associated with fibrosis. This review will briefly examine the comparative valve pathology and then, in more detail, the transcriptomic profiling and gene expression reported so far for both species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Molecular typing techniques and their combinations have allowed for species identification among members of the Campylobacter genus with good resolution, but the same tools usually fail to proceed to subtyping of closely related species due to high sequence similarity. This problem is exacerbated by the demanding conditions for isolation and detection from the human, animal or water samples as well as due to the difficulties during laboratory maintenance and long-term storage of the isolates. In an effort to define the ideal typing tool, we underline the strengths and limitations of the typing methodologies currently used to map the broad epidemiologic profile of campylobacteriosis in public health and outbreak investigations. The application of both the old and the new molecular typing tools is discussed and an indirect comparison is presented among the preferred techniques used in current research methodology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In humans with dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial adiponectin protein expression is reduced compared to normal hearts and has been implicated in the pathology of cardiomyopathy. Serum adiponectin levels are often conflicting, with higher levels associated with poor survival in humans with congestive heart failure (CHF). We evaluated adiponectin serum concentrations and myocardial protein expression in dogs with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease and CHF. We compared the findings to active and hibernating brown bears as bears are adapted to endure an extreme period of low cardiac output during their annual hibernation. Bears exhibited largely the active high-molecular weight (HMW) versus the low-molecular weight isoforms of myocardial adiponectin (HMW:LMW = 6.3) during both the active period and hibernation, while healthy dogs exhibited a more balanced mix of isoforms. Dogs with CHF expressed predominately HMW isoforms of adiponectin (HMW:LMW = 12.5), appearing more similar to bears. In contrast to humans, serum adiponectin was significantly lower in dogs with CHF and lowest levels in the severest CHF class. In both dogs and bears, myocardial adiponectin was expressed independent of circulating adiponectin concentrations, suggesting a local regulatory mechanism within the heart.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Much progress has been done in recent years in terms of understanding the complex pathogenesis of this clinical syndrome and the identification of new treatments. As we learn more about it, we appreciate the striking similarities that exist in the clinical manifestations of this disease across species. Both in animals and people, atopic disease is becoming increasingly common and important similarities exist in terms of immunologic aberrations and the propensity for allergic sensitization. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most recent views on atopic dermatitis in both domestic species and in people emphasizing the similarities and the differences. A comparative approach can be beneficial in understanding the natural course of this disease and the variable response to existing therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

No studies have correlated the preoperative abdominal ultrasonography (US) findings with the clinical, surgical, cytopathologic, and histopathologic findings. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate abdominal US in the diagnosis of acute abdomen syndrome using surgery as a "criterion standard". The most frequently misinterpreted lesions with US were also identified. The study included 50 dogs and cats with physical examination, an US diagnosis, US guided fine-needle aspiration cytology, intraoperative findings, and histopathology. Intraoperatively, 49 primary and 43 secondary lesions were identified. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for US were calculated. There was a good agreement between the US diagnosis and intraoperative findings of 86.9% (80/92), for both primary and secondary lesions (p &lt; 0.0001). Cytology and histopathology examinations corroborated the US in 86.4% (n = 64/74) of primary and 66.2% of secondary (n = 49/79) lesions. Using US as the "criterion standard", the sensitivity of abdominal palpation for identification of ascites and masses was 32.4% and 43.7%, respectively, while the specificity was 93.7% and 94.4%, respectively. Abdominal US is a useful preoperative modality for diagnosing acute abdominal diseases in dogs and cats. Care should be taken with interpretation of gastrointestinal perforation, omental tumors, and common bile duct rupture, as these lesions are frequently misinterpreted with US.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A complex relationship commonly exists between owners and their companion animal, particularly around feeding behaviour. Obese companion animals commonly live alongside caregivers who are also struggling with their own body weight. This case report highlights the importance of a family-centred approach to canine obesity as a way to engage with the pet's caregivers to help maximize their compliance towards the successful implementation of a tailored weight loss programme. Lara, an overweight dog weighing 35 kilos with a body condition score (BCS) of 7-7.5/9, was referred for a nutritional assessment. A comprehensive, pro-active and multidisciplinary protocol, tailored towards a family-centred approach, was established. After a 16-week programme, Lara reached the target body weight. The caregivers' compliance was assessed as being excellent; they also reassessed their individual lifestyle and were able to increase awareness towards their own nutritional issues and body weight perception, resulting in weight loss in all caregivers. Lara's case report represents how a family-centred approach can lead to successful patient weight loss and to a modification in the caregivers' way of thinking about nutrition and their own lifestyle, with the final goal of living a healthier and longer life together.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The situation is more difficult when an encephalitis due to Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) and a concomitant olfactory neuroblastoma are present. This case report deals with the story of a 5-year-old Swiss shepherd dog with behavioral changes, seizures, epistaxis and ataxia. Following clinical and laboratory exams, a suspected diagnosis of CDV infection was hypothesized, and a therapy based on &#937;-interferon was administered. Every supporting therapy failed and the worsening of the clinical conditions led to the euthanasia of the patient. A neoformation in the right frontal lobe was found post mortem. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry investigation showed a non-suppurative demyelinating encephalitis, suggestive of CDV infection, and a desmoplastic epithelioid olfactory neuroblastoma. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first clinical pathological report of a non-suppurative encephalitis due to CDV infection and olfactory neuroblastoma in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, information on the welfare of animals involved in this kind of activity is often lacking. Horses are highly susceptible to work stressors related to physical constraints and/or to the need to control emotions while interacting with humans. Considerations of the emotional state of horses involved in EAIs have multiple valences: for the safety of humans and animals involved, for the quality and efficacy of interventions, as well as for ethical reasons. The aim of this unsystematic narrative review is to summarize the different approaches used for the evaluation of horses' stress responses, investigate their application in the context of EAIs, and discuss some methodological considerations for researchers and practitioners involved in EAI. The sources of information are mostly based on electronic databases (i.e., Medline, Scopus and Google scholar), as well as on hand searches of the references of retrieved literature, and discussions with experts in the field. At present, a few studies have investigated horses' stress responses during EAIs, and further studies are recommended, with the final aim to derive a reliable multidimensional method for assessing a horse's reaction during therapeutic programs, ultimately helping professionals to better develop interventions by taking into consideration the animal's perspective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Elevated arousal, negative moods, and lack of interest can negatively affect performance and learning. Psychoacoustic music promotes calming effects using simple and slow piano sounds and can positively impact well-being and functioning. This pilot study assessed the effects of music on blood pressure, pulse, arousal, and mood during a canine physical examination laboratory. In an AB/BA crossover study, 17 students were randomly allocated to practice physical examination skills while listening to Through a Dog's Ear, Volume 1. Psychological and physiologic data were collected. Nonparametric methods were used to test for significant differences in psychological and physiologic data and a linear mixed models approach was used to test for physiological differences. There were no significant baseline differences between the music and no music groups for DASS-21 depression, anxiety, or stress scores; however, there were significant time differences between pretest and posttest on arousal and mood as measured by the Profile of Mood Sates (POMS) Depression, Fatigue-Inertia, and Tension Anxiety subscales. Linear mixed models revealed no significant treatment effect on the pulse and diastolic blood pressure; however, there was a significant systolic blood pressure treatment effect. Future indications include repeating the study with a larger sample to examine longitudinal psychological and physiological benefits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Vitamin A and uric acid contents were measured in the serum, while liver samples were taken to determine the vitamin A content. Parts of the central nervous system and some internal organs were examined histologically. In the sixth week, ruffled feathers and uncoordinated gait were the earliest signs seen in the experimental group. The vitamin A content in the liver samples significantly decreased in the experimental group (0.09 mg/kg vs. 29.5 mg/kg). The serum level of uric acid in the experimental group was significantly higher (12.8 mg/dL vs. 3.38 mg/dL). Birds in the experimental group showed squamous metaplasia in the oesophagus. No histopathological alterations were seen in the central nervous system. The elevated uric acid level in the serum is worth mentioning.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056708</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A Preliminary Assessment of HTST Processing on Donkey Milk.</Title>	<Abstract>Due to increasing attention from consumers on non-bovine milk types, and to the increase in the number of small dairy donkey farms in Italy, farmers require more advanced and reliable processing devices, in order to guarantee a safe product of high quality. To this aim, a new small-scale High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) pasteurizer (72 &#176;C for 15 s), prototyped by the authors, was tested on donkey milk. The efficacy of the HTST device was tested on raw donkey milk microflora by enumeration of total aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus cereus. The biochemical quality was assessed by determining the protein profile by monodimensional electrophoresis and by measuring lysozyme activity. The HTST apparatus was able to reduce the total bacteria count, and to completely eradicate Enterobacteriaceae. Bacillus cereus, when present, was decreased with low efficiency. Changes in the protein profile were observed in milk pasteurized in accordance with both processes, although HTST seemed to limit casein degradation. Lysozyme activity was not substantially affected in comparison to raw donkey milk. In conclusion, a tailored small-volume HTST device could be safely applied to pasteurize donkey milk in on-farm pasteurization processes on small dairy donkey farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Turtles often inhabit urban parks. However, even if the animals seem harmless, they may serve as both reservoirs or accidental hosts for different serotypes of Leptospira spp. Leptospira spp. is a waterborne zoonotic bacterium relevant for public health. Reptiles and amphibians may play a role in the epidemiology, transmission, and persistence of Leptospira spp. In the present study, we observed the presence of anti-leptospiral agglutinins in a group of freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta) captured in three urban ponds of the metropolitan city of Turin, Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A number of parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire; the principal topics were: pet ownership, pet care, relationship between pets and children, and sources of information about pet management. Eighty-two parents completed the survey; 71.4% of them already had pets before having children; pet care and health has emerged to be rather important, since 96.4% of the pets are taken to the veterinarian at least once a year; moreover, the great majority of the parents (97.2%) were not worried about the possible risks, linked to pets, pertaining to their child's health. The present survey confirms that pets are mostly considered as members of the family, and not only as a benefit for the children. Moreover, the relationship between children and pets is basically seen as a positive experience for children.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Many similar features in human and dog cancers including, spontaneous development, clinical presentation, tumor heterogeneity, disease progression and response to conventional therapies have supported development of this comparative model as an alternative to mice. The highly conserved similarities between canine and human genomes are also key to this comparative analysis, especially when compared to the murine genome. Studies with canine mammary tumor (CMT) models have shown a strong genetic correlation with their human counterparts, particularly in terms of altered expression profiles of cell cycle regulatory genes, tumor suppressor and oncogenes and also a large group of non-coding RNAs or microRNAs (miRNAs). Because CMTs are considered predictive intermediate models for human breast cancer, similarities in genetic alterations and cancer predisposition between humans and dogs have raised further interest. Many cancer-associated genetic defects critical to mammary tumor development and oncogenic determinants of metastasis have been reported and appear to be similar in both species. Comparative analysis of deregulated gene sets or cancer signaling pathways has shown that a significant proportion of orthologous genes are comparably up- or down-regulated in both human and dog breast tumors. Particularly, a group of cell cycle regulators called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) acting as potent tumor suppressors are frequently defective in CMTs. Interestingly, comparative analysis of coding sequences has also shown that these genes are highly conserved in mammals in terms of their evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor. Moreover, co-deletion and/or homozygous loss of the INK4A/ARF/INK4B (CDKN2A/B) locus, encoding three members of the CKI tumor suppressor gene families (p16/INK4A, p14ARF and p15/INK4B), in many human and dog cancers including mammary carcinomas, suggested their important conserved genetic order and localization in orthologous chromosomal regions. miRNAs, as powerful post-transcriptional regulators of most of the cancer-associated genes, have not been well evaluated to date in animal cancer models. Comprehensive expression profiles of miRNAs in CMTs have revealed their altered regulation showing a strong correlation with those found in human breast cancers. These genetic correlations between human and dog mammary cancers will greatly advance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involving many critical cancer-associated genes that promote neoplasia and contribute to the promising development of future therapeutics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HM has hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29056713</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Understanding the Osteosarcoma Pathobiology: A Comparative Oncology Approach.</Title>	<Abstract>Osteosarcoma is an aggressive primary bone tumor in humans and is among the most common cancer afflicting dogs. Despite surgical advancements and intensification of chemo- and targeted therapies, the survival outcome for osteosarcoma patients is, as of yet, suboptimal. The presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis or its recurrence after initial therapy is a major factor for the poor outcomes. It is thought that most human and canine patients have at least microscopic metastatic lesions at diagnosis. Osteosarcoma in dogs occurs naturally with greater frequency and shares many biological and clinical similarities with osteosarcoma in humans. From a genetic perspective, osteosarcoma in both humans and dogs is characterized by complex karyotypes with highly variable structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. Similar molecular abnormalities have been observed in human and canine osteosarcoma. For instance, loss of TP53 and RB regulated pathways are common. While there are several oncogenes that are commonly amplified in both humans and dogs, such as MYC and RAS, no commonly activated proto-oncogene has been identified that could form the basis for targeted therapies. It remains possible that recurrent aberrant gene expression changes due to gene amplification or epigenetic alterations could be uncovered and these could be used for developing new, targeted therapies. However, the remarkably high genomic complexity of osteosarcoma has precluded their definitive identification. Several advantageous murine models of osteosarcoma have been generated. These include spontaneous and genetically engineered mouse models, including a model based on forward genetics and transposon mutagenesis allowing new genes and genetic pathways to be implicated in osteosarcoma development. The proposition of this review is that careful comparative genomic studies between human, canine and mouse models of osteosarcoma may help identify commonly affected and targetable pathways for alternative therapies for osteosarcoma patients. Translational research may be found through a path that begins in mouse models, and then moves through canine patients, and then human patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While chemotherapy is not likely to completely disappear from the armamentarium; the use of targeted therapies in combination with conventional treatment is becoming the standard of care in human medicine. Tyrosine kinases are pivotal points of functional cellular pathways and have been implicated in malignancy, inflammatory, and immune-mediated diseases. Pharmaceutical interventions targeting aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling has exploded and is the second most important area of drug development. The "Valley of Death" between drug discovery and approval threatens to blunt the enormous strides in cancer management seen thus far. Kinase inhibitors, as targeted small molecules, hold promise in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the use of kinase inhibitors in the interpretation and management of cancer. Comparative oncology has the potential to address restrictions and limitations in the advancement in kinase inhibitor therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The ex ante analysis framework was applied to identify the location of areas with high probability of HPAI H5N1 occurrence for the alternative vaccination program by using boosted regression trees (BRT) models, followed by weighted overlay operations. Cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programs was then estimated to measure the tradeoff between the past national poultry vaccination program and the alternative vaccination program. Ex ante analysis showed that the focus areas for the alternative vaccination program included 1137 communes, corresponding to 50.6% of total communes in the Delta, and located primarily in the coastal areas to the east and south of Hanoi. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the alternative vaccination program would have been more successful in reducing the rate of disease occurrence and the total cost of vaccinations, as compared to the national poultry vaccination program.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Canine osteosarcomas are considered a valuable model for human osteosarcomas because of their similar features. Feline osteosarcomas, on the other hand, are rarely studied but have interesting characteristics, such as a better survival prognosis than dogs or humans, and less likelihood of metastasis. To enable experimental approaches to study these differences we have established five new canine osteosarcoma cell lines out of three tumors, COS_1186h, COS_1186w, COS_1189, and COS_1220, one osteosarcoma-derived lung metastasis, COS_1033, and two new feline osteosarcoma cell lines, FOS_1077 and FOS_1140. Their osteogenic and neoplastic origin, as well as their potential to produce calcified structures, was determined by the markers osteocalcin, osteonectin, tissue unspecific alkaline phosphatase, p53, cytokeratin, vimentin, and alizarin red. The newly developed cell lines retained most of their markers in vitro but only spontaneously formed spheroids produced by COS_1189 showed calcification in vitro.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During the asymptomatic phase, a cohort of experimentally FIV-infected cats exhibits features of viral latency in blood suggestive of inactive viral replication. We sought to investigate viral replication activity and genomic stability of the FIV proviral long terminal repeat (LTR) and the 5' aspect of gag over time. FIV-infected cats during the asymptomatic phase demonstrated undetectable plasma FIV gag RNA transcripts and intermittent to undetectable blood-derived cell-associated FIV gag RNA. The LTR sequence demonstrated instability in blood-derived cells over time, in spite of low to undetectable viral replication. Sequence variation in the LTR was identified in CD4+ and CD21+ leukocytes from blood and surgically removed lymph nodes. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LTR were commonly identified. Promoter functionality of a common LTR SNP and rare U3 mutation were examined by reporter gene assays and demonstrated either no change or increased basal FIV promoter function, respectively. In conclusion, this cohort of asymptomatic FIV-infected cats demonstrated instability of the LTR and 5' gag sequences during the study period, in spite of undetectable plasma and rare to undetectable viral gag RNA, which suggests that blood may not accurately represent viral activity in asymptomatic FIV-infected cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Concerning Lyme disease spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato group, a broad range of diverse vertebrates serve as reservoir or even as incidental hosts, including humans. The capability to infect multiple hosts implies that spirochetes have developed sophisticated means to counter the destructive effects of complement of humans and various animals. While the means by which spirochetes overcome the hosts immune defense are far from being completely understood, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that binding of the key regulator of the alternative pathway, Factor H, plays a pivotal role for immune evasion and that Factor H is an important determinant of host specificity. This review covers (i) the contribution of complement in host-specificity and transmissibility of Lyme disease spirochetes; (ii) the involvement of borrelial-derived determinants to host specificity; (iii) the interplay of human and animal Factor H with complement-acquiring surface proteins of diverse borrelial species; and (iv) the potential role of additional animal complement proteins in the immune evasion of spirochetes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain revealed poorly circumscribed regions of non-contrast-enhancing heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity within the ventral forebrain and midbrain. A mass effect and evidence of increased intracranial pressure, including transtentorial herniation of the midbrain and herniation of the cerebellar vermis through the foramen magnum, were also observed. Due to progressive clinical decline and MRI results, the cat was humanely euthanized. Gross examination of the brain confirmed caudal transtentorial and foramen magnum herniation. The ventral aspect of the forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem were soft and had loss of detail, but lacked a grossly discernible mass. Histopathological examination found a poorly delineated neoplastic mass composed of hyperchromatic cells with indistinct cytoplasm, ovoid to elongate or curved nuclei, and indistinct nucleoli. The cells lacked immunoreactivity for Olig2, GFAP, Iba1, CD3, and Pax5. Based on the cellular morphology, immunolabeling characteristics, and anatomical location, a diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri was made. Although uncommon, gliomatosis cerebri should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cats with central nervous system disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Staphylococci are a significant opportunistic pathogen both in humans and dairy cattle. In the present study, the genotypic characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains recovered from dairy cattle in a rural community (Okada, Edo State, Nigeria) was investigated. A total of 283 samples from cattle (137 milk samples and 146 nasal swabs) were assessed between February and April 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was employed for the detection of 16S rRNA, mecA and Panton-Valentine Leucocidinis (PVL) genes. The staphylococcal strains were identified through partial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acids (rRNA) nucleotide sequencing, and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of the gene sequence showed that the staphylococcal strains have 96%-100% similarity to Staphylococcus aureus (30), S. epidermidis (17), S. haemolyticus (15), S. saprophyticus (13), S. chromogenes (8), S. simulans (7), S. pseudintermedius (6) and S. xylosus (4). Resistance of 100% was observed in all Staphylococcus spp. against MET, PEN, CLN, CHL and SXT. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria from nasal cavities and raw milk reveals 13 isolates were MDR against MET[R], PEN[R], AMX[R], CLN[R], CHL[R], SXT[R] CLX[R], KAN[R], ERY[R], and VAN[R]. Of all isolates, 100% harboured the mecA gene, while 30% of the isolates possess the PVL gene. All S. aureus harboured the PVL gene while other Staphylococcus spp. were negative for the PVL gene. The presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolates in dairy cattle is a potential public health risk and thus findings in this study can be used as a baseline for further surveillance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This obligate intracellular bacterium evolved to use common strategies to establish infection in both vertebrate hosts and tick vectors. Herein, we discuss the different strategies used by the pathogen to modulate cell apoptosis and establish infection in host cells. In vertebrate neutrophils and human promyelocytic cells HL-60, both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors have been reported. Tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and differential regulation of apoptosis pathways have been observed in adult female midguts and salivary glands in response to infection with A. phagocytophilum. In tick midguts, pathogen inhibits apoptosis through the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, while in salivary glands, the intrinsic apoptosis pathways is inhibited but tick cells respond with the activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In Ixodes scapularis ISE6 cells, bacterial infection down-regulates mitochondrial porin and manipulates protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and cell glucose metabolism to inhibit apoptosis and facilitate infection, whereas in IRE/CTVM20 tick cells, inhibition of apoptosis appears to be regulated by lower caspase levels. These results suggest that A. phagocytophilum uses different mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis for infection of both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The close proximity of this companion animal, however, goes beyond sharing the same roof; it extends to the great similarity found at the cellular and molecular levels. Researchers have found a striking resemblance between subtypes of feline mammary tumors and their human counterparts that goes from the genes to the pathways involved in cancer initiation and progression. Spontaneous cat mammary pre-invasive intraepithelial lesions (hyperplasias and neoplasias) and malignant lesions seem to share a wide repertoire of molecular features with their human counterparts. In the present review, we tried to compile all the genetics aspects published (i.e., chromosomal alterations, critical cancer genes and their expression) regarding cat mammary tumors, which support the cat as a valuable alternative in vitro cell and animal model (i.e., cat mammary cell lines and the spontaneous tumors, respectively), but also to present a critical point of view of some of the issues that really need to be investigated in future research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, p16, p53, and pRb proteins were detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry in forty-three FOSCC primary tumors and three FOSCC xenografts. p16 mRNA levels were also measured in three FOSCC cell lines (SCCF1, F2, and F3), which were consistent with their p16 immunoreactivity. Feline SCCF1 cells had very high levels of p16 protein and mRNA (55-fold greater) compared to SCCF2 and F3. A partial feline p16 cDNA sequence was amplified and sequenced. The average age of cats with FOSCC with high p16 immunoreactivity was significantly lower than the average age in the low p16 group. Eighteen of 43 (42%) FOSCCs had low p16 intensity, while 6/43 (14%) had high p16 immunoreactivity. Feline papillomavirus L1 (major capsid) DNA was not detected in the SCC cell lines or the FOSCCs with high p16 immunostaining. Five of 6 (83%) of the high p16 FOSCC had low p53, but only 1/6 (17%) had low pRb immunoreactivity. In summary, the staining pattern of p16, p53, and pRb in FOSCC was different from human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and feline cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The majority of FOSCCs have low p16 immunostaining intensity, therefore, inactivation of CDKN2A is suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of FOSCC. A subset of FOSCCs had increased p16 protein, which supports an alternate pathogenesis of cancer in these cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, while there has much progress in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms, including antigenic variation, of the pathogen, the host side of the equation has been neglected. Using different approaches, we studied, in immunocompetent inbred mice, the dynamics of infection with and host responses to North American relapsing fever agent B. hermsii. The spirochete's generation time in blood of infected mice was between 4-5 h and, after a delay, was matched in rate by the increase of specific agglutinating antibodies in response to the infection. After initiating serotype cells were cleared by antibodies, the surviving spirochetes were a different serotype and, as a population, grew more slowly. The retardation was attributable to the host response and not an inherently slower growth rate. The innate responses at infection peak and immediate aftermath were characterized by elevations of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Immunodeficient mice had higher spirochete burdens and severe anemia, which was accounted for by aggregation of erythrocytes by spirochetes and their partially reversible sequestration in greatly enlarged spleens and elsewhere.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The most severe life-threatening illnesses, such as human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis and heartwater, occur in incidental hosts. Ehrlichia have a developmental cycle involving an infectious, nonreplicating, dense core cell and a noninfectious, replicating reticulate cell. Ehrlichiae secrete proteins that bind to host cytoplasmic proteins and nuclear chromatin, manipulating the host cell environment to their advantage. Severe disease in immunocompetent hosts is mediated in large part by immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, including overproduction of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), which is produced by CD8 T lymphocytes, and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Immune components that contribute to control of ehrlichial infection include CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;), IL-12, and antibodies. Some immune components, such as TNF-&#945;, perforin, and CD8 T cells, play both pathogenic and protective roles. In contrast with the immunocompetent host, which may die with few detectable organisms owing to the overly strong immune response, immunodeficient hosts die with overwhelming infection and large quantities of organisms in the tissues. Vaccine development is challenging because of antigenic diversity of E. ruminantium, the necessity of avoiding an immunopathologic response, and incomplete knowledge of the protective antigens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this scenario, not much attention was given to health traits. As a consequence of that, selection was made for animals with higher production and a shortened productive life. In addition to that, the intense production system used in livestock has forced animals to be exposed to higher pathogen loads, therefore predisposing them to infections. Infectious diseases are known to be caused by micro-organisms that are able to infect and colonize the host, affecting their physiological functions and causing problems in their production and on animal welfare. Even with the best management practices, diseases are still the most important cause of economic losses in the animal industry.

In humans, various methods of patient heating have been demonstrated to be useful, but less evaluation has been performed in techniques to prevent hypothermia perioperatively in pigs. Methods: We compared body temperature regulation during surgery before and after modification of the ambient temperature of the operating laboratories. Three different methods of heating were then compared; a standard circulating water mattress, a resistive fabric blanket, and a forced hot air system. The primary measure was percentage of temperature readings outside a specification range of 36.7-40.0 &#176;C. Results: Tighter control of the ambient temperature while using a circulating water mattress reduced the occurrence of out-of-specification body temperature readings from 20.8% to 5.0%, with most of these the result of hypothermia. Use of a resistive fabric blanket further reduced out-of-specification readings to 1.5%, with a slight increase in the occurrence of hyperthermia. Use of a forced air system reduced out-of-specification readings to less 0.1%. Conclusions: Maintenance of normothermia perioperatively in pig can be improved by tightly controlling ambient temperatures. Use of a resistive blanket or a forced air system can lead to better control than a circulating water mattress, with the forced air system providing a faster response to temperature variations and less chance of hyperthermia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Australia, economic losses to the cattle industry from tick fever are estimated at AUD$26 Million per annum. If animals recover from these infections, they become immune carriers. Here we describe a novel multiplex TaqMan qPCR targeting cytochrome b genes for the identification of Babesia spp. The assay shows high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, and allows quantification of parasite DNA from Babesia bovis and B. bigemina compared to standard PCR assays. A previously published cytochrome b SYBR Green qPCR was also tested in this study, showing slightly higher sensitivity than the Taqman qPCRs but requires melting curve analysis post-PCR to confirm specificity. The SYBR Green assays were further evaluated using both diagnostic submissions and vaccinated cattle (at 7, 9, 11 and 14 days post-inoculation) showed that B. bigemina can be detected more frequently than B. bovis. Due to fewer circulating parasites, B. bovis detection in carrier animals requires higher DNA input. Preliminary data for a novel fluorescent PCR genotyping based on the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 region to detect vaccine and field alleles of B. bovis are described. This assay is capable of detecting vaccine and novel field isolate alleles in a single sample.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Microtubules localize to the ApV to a lesser extent. Vimentin, keratin-8, and keratin-18 but not tubulin expression is upregulated in A. phagocytophilum infected cells. SUMO-2/3 but not SUMO-1 colocalizes with vimentin filaments that surround ApVs. PolySUMOylation of vimentin by SUMO-2/3 but not SUMO-1 decreases vimentin solubility. Consistent with this, more vimentin exists in an insoluble state in A. phagocytophilum infected cells than in uninfected cells. Knocking down the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, abrogates vimentin assembly at the ApV but has no effect on the bacterial load. Bacterial protein synthesis is dispensable for maintaining vimentin and SUMO-2/3 at the ApV. Withaferin A, which inhibits soluble vimentin, reduces vimentin recruitment to the ApV, optimal ApV formation, and the bacterial load when administered prior to infection but is ineffective once vimentin has assembled on the ApV. Thus, A. phagocytophilum modulates cytoskeletal component expression and co-opts polySUMOylated vimentin to aid construction of its vacuolar niche and promote optimal survival.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For each of these bacteria, there is a complex of closely related genospecies and/or strains that are genetically distinct and have been shown through both observational and experimental studies to have different host tropisms. In this review we compare the known ecologies of these two bacterial complexes in the far western USA and find remarkable similarities, which will help us understand evolutionary histories and coadaptation among vertebrate host, tick vector, and bacteria. For both complexes, sensu stricto genospecies (those that infect humans) share a similar geographic range, are vectored mainly by ticks in the Ixodes ricinus-complex, utilize mainly white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) as a reservoir in the eastern USA and tree squirrels in the far west, and tend to be generalists, infecting a wider variety of vertebrate host species. Other sensu lato genospecies within each complex are generally more specialized, occurring often in local enzootic cycles within a narrow range of vertebrate hosts and specialized vector species. We suggest that these similar ecologies may have arisen through utilization of a generalist tick species as a vector, resulting in a potentially more virulent generalist pathogen that spills over into humans, vs. utilization of a specialized tick vector on a particular vertebrate host species, promoting microbe specialization. Such tight host-vector-pathogen coupling could also facilitate high enzootic prevalence and the evolution of host immune-tolerance and bacterial avirulence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two of the best described innate immune signaling networks are the Toll- and the Nod-like receptor pathways. Extensive work has been done characterizing both signaling cascades with several recent advances on the forefront of inflammasome biology. In this review, we will discuss how more commonly-studied pathogens differ from tick-transmitted microbes in the context of Nod-like receptor signaling and inflammasome formation. Because pathogens transmitted by ticks have unique characteristics, we offer the opinion that these microbes can be used to uncover novel principles of Nod-like receptor biology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tick cell and organ cultures provide convenient tools for propagation and study of arboviruses, both tick-borne and insect-borne, enabling elucidation of virus-tick cell interaction and yielding insight into the mechanisms behind vector competence and reservoir potential for different arbovirus species. The mosquito-borne zoonotic alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which replicates well in tick cells, has been isolated from Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, and Amblyomma spp. ticks removed from mammalian hosts in East Africa; however nothing is known about any possible role of ticks in SFV epidemiology. Here we present a light and electron microscopic study of SFV infecting cell lines and organ cultures derived from African Rhipicephalus spp. ticks. As well as demonstrating the applicability of these culture systems for studying virus-vector interactions, we provide preliminary evidence to support the hypothesis that SFV is not normally transmitted by ticks because the virus does not infect midgut cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since haptoglobin is known to undergo tissue specific glycosylation resulting in different isoforms, this study was undertaken to characterize the isoforms of haptoglobin. Milk whey fraction and serum obtained from animals with or without clinical mastitis in Puducherry, India, were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blot and immuno-detection of haptoglobin protein. All subunits (&#946;, &#945;1 and &#945;2) of haptoglobin protein were detected in serum sample obtained from clinical cases. However, only the &#946;-subunit was detected in milk whey fraction obtained from the respective animals. Similar results were observed with milk whey fractions from subclinical cases indicating difference in isoform of haptoglobin detected in milk whey from serum. This was further supported by RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis of haptoglobin gene (Hp) confirming the tissue specific origin of haptoglobin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to conduct the assessment, four provinces were randomly selected as a study group from a total of 19 Thai provinces that are currently using a One Health approach. As a control group, four additional provinces that never implemented a One Health approach were also sampled. The provincial officers were interviewed on the epidemiologic capacity of their respective provinces. The average score of epidemiologic capacity in the provinces implementing the One Health approach was 66.45%, while the provinces that did not implement this approach earned a score of 54.61%. The epidemiologic capacity of surveillance systems in provinces that utilized the One Health approach earned higher scores in comparison to provinces that did not implement the approach (75.00% vs. 53.13%, p-value 0.13). Although none of the capacity evaluations showed significant differences between the two groups, we found evidence that provinces implementing the One Health approach gained higher scores in both surveillance and outbreak investigation capacities. This may be explained by more efficient capacity when using a One Health approach, specifically in preventing, protecting, and responding to threats in local communities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Most of these approaches employ culture systems that allow stem cell-derived or tissue progenitor cells to self-organize into three-dimensional (3D)-structures. Since organoids can be grown from different species (human, mouse, cat, dog), organs (intestine, kidney, brain, liver), and from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, they create significant prospects for modelling development and diseases, for toxicology and drug discovery studies, and in the field of regenerative medicine.

Due to its immune modulation properties, they are commonly used in the therapeutic approach of various retroviral infections, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In HIV infection, it has been shown that IFN therapy limits early viral replication, particularly useful on post-exposure prophylaxis. In veterinary medicine, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-&#969;) was the first interferon licensed for use in cats. Several studies have recently shown that this compound seems to stimulate the innate immunity, decreasing clinical signs and co-infections in naturally FIV-infected cats. More than summarizing the main conclusions about rFeIFN-&#969; in cats, this review emphasizes the immune-modulation properties of IFN therapy, opening new perspectives for its use in retroviral infections. Either in FIV-infected cats or in HIV individuals, type I IFNs seem to induce an innate immune-modulation and should not be overlooked as a therapeutic option in retroviral infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The presence of these endosymbionts can confound a One Health approach to combatting tick-borne diseases. Genomic analyses of symbiotic rickettsiae have revealed that they harbor mutations in gene coding for proteins involved in rickettsial pathogenicity and motility. We have isolated and characterized two rickettsial symbionts-Rickettsia peacockii and R. buchneri-both from ticks using tick cell cultures. To better track these enigmatic rickettsiae in ticks and at the tick-mammal interface we transformed the rickettsiae to express fluorescent proteins using shuttle vectors based on rickettsial plasmids or a transposition system driving insertional mutagenesis. Fluorescent protein expressing R. buchneri and R. peacockii will enable us to elucidate their interactions with tick and mammalian cells, and track their location and movement within individual cells, vector ticks, and host animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus it is important to minimize the number of false-negative diagnoses. In order to evaluate the question of whether or not a single cytobrush sample is representative of the whole endometrium, 53 German Holstein embryo donor cows in the northwest of Germany were examined via the cytobrush method at three different localizations of the uterus: the uterine body about 0.5 cm cranial of the cervical canal and both uterine horns about 1.5 cm cranial of the bifurcation. Although the mean percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils at the three locations is not significantly different (p = 0.64), the individual variations lead to the conclusion that more than one sample of the endometrium should be taken into account when diagnosing subclinical endometritis in embryo donor cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

All subjects were identified by sex, age, breed, and body weight (bw). An oscillating saw was used for a circumferential craniotomy to open the skulls; the brains were removed and weighed using a digital scale. For statistical analysis, p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The work demonstrated a strong relationship between the observed and predicted BW by using the Bronson equation. It was possible to hypothesize that groups B and D present a greater encephalization level than M breeds, that B and D dog breeds are more closely related to each other than to M, and from the three groups, the D individuals presented the highest brain mass mean.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of the survey was to examine the prevalence of various presenting signs at the sanctuary. The presenting signs were classified into nine non-mutually exclusive categories: ocular disorders, nasal disorders, oral disorders, respiratory disorders, orthopaedic disorders, puncture wounds, abrasions, netting injuries, and onychia. The sex ratio of seal pups in this study was 1.35 males per female. Of the 205 examined for rehabilitation, 22 (10.73%) did not survive to release. 68.78% of grey seal pups presented with puncture wounds, 47.80% with respiratory disorders, 46.34% with ocular disorders, 42.63% malnourished, 36.59% with abrasions, 25.37% with oral disorders, 23.90% with nasal disorders, 11.71% with orthopaedic disorders, 9.27% with onychia, and 3.41% presented with netting injuries. 52% were normothermic, 42% were hyperthermic, and 5% were hypothermic. Associations between gender, outcome of rehabilitation, hospitalisation time and presenting disorders were examined. In addition, admissions rates were found to display seasonality. The results of this study will aid in future preparation of grey seal rehabilitation facilities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In people, gingival overgrowth is a common complication of cyclosporine administration for immunosuppression, generally following transplant procedures. Azithromycin has been used successfully for managing gingival overgrowth in human transplant patients when cyclosporine administration cannot be reduced or discontinued. This case series describes six dogs being administered cyclosporine for various dermatologic diseases that developed gingival overgrowth. The dogs were prescribed systemic azithromycin, with or without concurrent dose reduction of cyclosporine. Oral administration of 6.6-10.8 mg/kg of azithromycin once daily for 4-14 weeks was effective for complete clinical resolution of gingival overgrowth. In most cases, gingival overgrowth did not recur even with continued cyclosporine administration long-term. Adverse events of long-term azithromycin administration did not occur in any of the dogs. This series highlights a potentially beneficial medical treatment option for gingival overgrowth even when cyclosporine dose reduction is not possible or elected, without the need for surgical resection of proliferative gingival tissue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The convergence of the fields of human and animal medicine has the potential to generate novel scientific hypotheses, create effective new therapies and potentially transform how physicians, veterinarians and their patients understand health and disease. Despite this potential, One Health has not yet gained significant awareness or traction in human medical communities. From its inception, One Health, sometimes also called One Medicine, has been piloted primarily by leaders from the world of veterinary medicine. Although the specific term was coined perhaps 10 years ago, comparative medicine has been quietly evident on university campuses with veterinary and medical schools for decades longer. Although a few physicians have played major leadership roles in One Health, in the United States, despite over ten years of the movement's robust growth, many have still not heard of it. Furthermore, physicians with some awareness of One Health often believe it to be primarily and exclusively about zoonotic infections and global health. The much broader scope and potential of One Health as also including comparative physiology and medicine is not being communicated effectively. Consequently, the human medical community remains largely disengaged. This is problematic because without significant engagement from physicians, nurses and other human health care professionals, the potential of One Health cannot be realized. To advance One Health it is imperative that we first understand the roots of under-engagement of the human medical community. This, in turn, can guide the development of novel and engaging opportunities for physician which demonstrate the power relevance of One Health's comparative, collaborative and cooperative approach.[...].</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of colostrum antibody concentrations in identifying Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) PI (persistently infected) calf carrying beef heifers following an experimental infection. Colostrum was collected within 12 hours of parturition and tested in undiluted, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:500 dilutions using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for BVDV antibody. Cows were determined to be carrying a PI calf based on positive quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction and antigen ELISA result on pre-colostral serum and ear notch samples collected from their calf. The median ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio for colostrum collected from heifers that carried a PI calf were significantly higher than the median ELISA S/P ratio for colostrum collected from heifers that did not carry a PI calf at dilutions of 1:100, 1:200, and 1:500. This study provides further evidence for increased antigenic stimulation in utero by the BVDV viraemic PI calf, which can also be identified with 100% diagnostic sensitivity when using 1:500 dilution colostrum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Unique primers targeting the highly conserved house-keeping gene (uvrC) were designed and the probe sequence was derived from a previously published microarray study. There was 100% agreement in the outcome between our assay and the other two published assays for M. bovis detection. The analytical limit of detection of our assay is 83 copies of the uvrC gene. This assay was validated on a total of 214 bovine clinical specimens that were submitted to the Texas A&amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL), Texas, USA. The specificity of the assay was assessed to be 100% since no cross-reactivity occurred with 22 other bacterial and other Mycoplasma species. We conclude that the uvrC gene serves as a good and reliable diagnostic marker for the accurate and rapid detection of M. bovis from a wider variety of specimen matrices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Expression of mRNA encoding orthologs of IL-17 and the IL-17 receptor has been documented in tissues from dogs with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma; however, no associations have been found between IL-17 gene expression and disease phenotype in these conditions. Robust assessment of the role of IL-17-producing cells in dogs will require measuring the frequency of these cells in health and disease in balance with other lymphocyte subsets. The aim of this study was to confirm that the T-cell IL-17 response in dogs is evolutionarily conserved. Canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with Concanavalin A with or without polarizing cytokines. We used a canine specific IL-17 ELISA and flow cytometry to identify IL-17-producing T cells. Accumulation of intracellular IL-17 was observed in stimulated CD4 and CD8 T cells. The addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines appeared to enhance polarization of canine CD4 T cells to the Th17 phenotype. Conversely, the addition of IL-2 in the presence of TGF-&#946; resulted in expansion of Treg cells. We conclude that canine IL-17-producing cells behave similarly to those from humans and mice when stimulated with mitogens and polarized with pro-inflammatory or immune regulatory cytokines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the alkylation study we show that lomustine and its metabolites form similar levels of the DNA adducts N[7] hydroxyethylguanine and O[6] hydroxyethyldeoxyguanosine. In terms of carbamylation, lomustine showed greater extent of carbamylation in the canine hepatocytes and lymphoma cell lines. The DNA repair enzyme O[6] methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) causes resistance of tumor cells to bifunctional nitrosourea, like lomustine. There is no data available regarding MGMT expression/activity in canine cells or tissues. Our study shows that there is low MGMT activity in the canine lymphoid cell line 17-71 while the GL-1 cells did not show any detectable enzyme activity or mRNA expression. The MGMT enzyme activity measured in canine hepatocytes is about 250-350 fmol/mg protein as compared to about 90 fmol/mg protein in 17-71 cells. We also show that MGMT mRNA expression in 17-71 cells and canine hepatocytes positively correlates with its enzyme activity in these cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Through a comparative case-study approach, this research explores how federalism, bureaucratic behavior, and institutional design in the United States may influence zoonotic disease outbreak detection and reporting, a key One Health activity. Using theoretical and empirical literature, as well as a survey/interview instrument for individuals directly involved in a past zoonotic disease outbreak, the impacts of governance are discussed. As predicted in the theoretical literature, empirical findings suggest that federalism, institutional design, and bureaucracy may play a role in facilitating or impeding zoonotic disease outbreak detection and reporting. Regulatory differences across states as well as compartmentalization of information within agencies may impede disease detection. However, the impact may not always be negative: bureaucracies can also be adaptive; federalism allows states important opportunities for innovation. While acknowledging there are many other factors that also matter in zoonotic disease detection and reporting, this research is one of the first attempts to raise awareness in the literature and stimulate discussion on the intersection of governance and One Health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Electron microscopy performed on kidney tissue from 5/6 mice demonstrated margination of the chromatin in large nuclei. Laboratory tests were used to detect nucleic acid of papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, circoviruses and anelloviruses (4/6 mice), a specific PCR was used to detect murine polyomavirus (1/6), and a panel of serological tests was used to detect seroconversion to major murine pathogens (1/6). All molecular and serological tests were negative. Immunohistochemistry using polyclonal anti-bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) L1 antibody, Camvir monoclonal anti-papillomavirus antibody (directed against the seven amino acids GFGAMDF found in human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 L1 protein), a commercially available mixture of two monoclonal antibodies, anti-BPV-1 L1/1H8 + Camvir antibodies, and a monoclonal anti-Hsc70 antibody revealed specific, positive staining of murine renal tubular epithelial intranuclear inclusions in 6/6 mice using the anti-BPV-1 L1 containing antibodies only. Methyl pyronin green, PAS and Feulgen histochemical reactions revealed that the intranuclear inclusions did not consist of RNA, DNA or carbohydrate.

Domestic cats share many of the benefits of dogs as a model (spontaneous cancers developing in an immunocompetent animal sharing the same environment as humans, shorter lifespan allowing more rapid trial completion and data collection, lack of standard of care for many cancers allowing evaluation of therapies in treatment-na&#239;ve populations), but have not been utilized to the same degree in the One Medicine approach to cancer. There are both challenges and opportunities in feline compared to canine models. This review will discuss three specific tumor types where cats may offer insights into human cancers. Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma is common, shares both clinical and molecular features with human head and neck cancer and is an attractive model for evaluating new therapies. Feline mammary tumors are usually malignant and aggressive, with the 'triple-negative' phenotype being more common than in humans, offering an enriched population in which to examine potential targets and treatments. Finally, although there is not an exact corollary in humans, feline injection site sarcoma may be a model for inflammation-driven tumorigenesis, offering opportunities for studying variations in individual susceptibility as well as preventative and therapeutic strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, it is less considered in veterinary medicine, even if it has the potential to improve public health because of the role of veterinary medicine in public health. For this reason, an One Health approach is useful for communication as well. This approach leads to a "One Communication" concept, which is the result of the synergy in communicative efforts both in human and in veterinary medicine. Our analysis explores the potential of communication in several veterinary fields: institutions, food safety, companion animal and food-producing animal practice, pharmacology and drugs, wildlife fauna and environment. In almost all the areas of veterinary activity communication can contribute to human health. It takes many forms and use several channels, and this variety of communicative opportunities represent a challenge for veterinarians. For this reason, the communication course should be included in the curricula of Veterinary Medicine Schools.

<Rec><Common><PMID>29061939</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Mechanisms of Drug Resistance in Veterinary Oncology- A Review with an Emphasis on Canine Lymphoma.</Title>	<Abstract>Drug resistance (DR) is the major limiting factor in the successful treatment of systemic neoplasia with cytotoxic chemotherapy. DR can be either intrinsic or acquired, and although the development and clinical implications are different, the underlying mechanisms are likely to be similar. Most causes for DR are pharmacodynamic in nature, result from adaptations within the tumor cell and include reduced drug uptake, increased drug efflux, changes in drug metabolism or drug target, increased capacity to repair drug-induced DNA damage or increased resistance to apoptosis. The role of active drug efflux transporters, and those of the ABC-transporter family in particular, have been studied extensively in human oncology and to a lesser extent in veterinary medicine. Methods reported to assess ABC-transporter status include detection of the actual protein (Western blot, immunohistochemistry), mRNA or ABC-transporter function. The three major ABC-transporters associated with DR in human oncology are ABCB1 or P-gp, ABCC1 or MRP1, and ABCG2 or BCRP, and have been demonstrated in canine cell lines, healthy dogs and dogs with cancer. Although this supports a causative role for these ABC-transporters in DR cytotoxic agents in the dog, the relative contribution to the clinical phenotype of DR in canine cancer remains an area of debate and requires further prospective studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29061940</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Comparative Aspects of Molecular Mechanisms of Drug Resistance through ABC Transporters and Other Related Molecules in Canine Lymphoma.</Title>	<Abstract>The most important causes of treatment failure in canine lymphoma include intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is essential for the establishment of better treatment alternatives for lymphoma patients. The overexpression of drug transporters is one of the most intensively studied mechanisms of drug resistance in many tumors. In canine lymphoma, it has also been shown that the overexpression of drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein is associated with drug-resistant phenotypes. Canine lymphoma has many pathological similarities to human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and they also share similar molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. We have previously demonstrated the association of the overexpression of drug transporters with drug resistance and indicated some molecular mechanisms of the regulation of these transporters' expressions in canine and human lymphoid tumor cells. However, it has also been indicated that other known or novel drug resistance factors should be explored to overcome drug resistance in lymphoma. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and possible strategies to develop better treatment modalities for canine lymphoma from the comparative aspects with human lymphoid tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty Holstein-Friesian dairy cows from a commercial dairy herd in Cambridgeshire, England, were used in this randomised, blinded, controlled study. On each of the experimental cows an area of unclipped gluteal skin on one side of the pelvis was treated with swabs soaked in 70% isopropyl alcohol-based using a standard protocol and a contra-lateral area of skin was left untreated as a control. All the experimental skin sites were sampled using a swab followed by bacterial culture and quantitative analysis of bacterial load. There was a statistically significant decrease in the bacterial colony forming units per mL for the isopropyl-alcohol treatment group when compared to the control group (p &#8804; 0.01). There was a 58% reduction in the median bacterial load of the treated sites when compared to the bacterial load of the untreated sites. This study has demonstrated that the treatment protocol will reduce the skin bacterial load.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The biologic behavior of OS is conserved between people and dogs, and evidence suggests that fundamental discoveries in OS biology can be facilitated through detailed and comparative studies. In particular, the relative genetic homogeneity associated with specific dog breeds can provide opportunities to facilitate the discovery of key genetic drivers involved in OS pathogenesis, which, to-date, remain elusive. In this review, known causative factors that predispose to the development OS in human beings and dogs are summarized in detail. Based upon the commonalities shared in OS pathogenesis, it is likely that foundational discoveries in one species will be translationally relevant to the other and emphasizes the unique opportunities that might be gained through comparative scientific approaches.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The characterization and discovery of BRAF mutations in a variety of human cancers has led to the development of specific inhibitors targeting the BRAF/MAPK pathway and dramatically changed clinical outcomes in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Recent discovery of BRAF mutation in canine cancers underscores the importance of MAPK pathway activation as an oncogenic molecular alteration evolutionarily conserved between species. A comparative approach using the domestic dog as a spontaneous cancer model will provide new insights into the dysregulation of BRAF/MAPK pathway in carcinogenesis and facilitate in vivo studies to evaluate therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway's molecules for cancer therapy. The BRAF mutation in canine cancers may also represent a molecular marker and therapeutic target in veterinary oncology. This review article summarizes the current knowledge on BRAF mutations in human and canine cancers and discusses the potential applications of this abnormality in veterinary oncology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Beyond the continual need to enhance the sophistication of feline healthcare per se, the unique spectrum of naturally-occurring cancers in the cat offers tremendous opportunities for comparative and translational advances that may have mutual benefit for human and veterinary medicine. The study of feline cancers additionally may generate new insight into underexplored aspects of tumor biology that are less accessible in other species, such as the relationship between chronic inflammation and neoplasia, and the role of viruses in malignant transformation. Several factors that have hindered molecular studies of feline cancers have now been surmounted, with the most fundamental step forward coming from the development of a high-quality reference genome sequence assembly for the cat. This article reviews landmark studies that have led to our current appreciation of feline genome architecture, and outlines techniques used in cancer cytogenomics, from conventional karyotyping analysis through to the development of genomic microarrays and beyond. A summary of progress in the identification and characterization of chromosomal aberrations in feline cancers is provided using examples from studies of injection-site sarcomas, lymphomas and mammary tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its clinical pattern and histopathology are similar to ocular lesions observed in humans suffering from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly named Wegener's granulomatosis, where the pathogenesis revolves around anti-neutrophil antibodies (e.g., anti-myeloperoxidase). These antibodies are used to diagnose and follow-up the disease in humans, but variants that only affect the eyes often test negative. Here, we present the first case of canine necrotizing scleritis where measurement of anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies was attempted. A 1.5 year-old female Scottish Terrier was presented with bilateral deep multifocal scleromalacia, severe inflammation of corneal/uveal/retrobulbar tissues, perilimbal corneal oedema and neovascularization, hypotony, and mild exophthalmos. Corticosteroids and antibiotics had been administrated (topically and orally) without success. Due to painful multifocal scleral perforation with vitreal haemorrhage, the left eye underwent enucleation, so did the right eye one week later. The histopathology of the left eye revealed a neutrophilic and histiocytic scleral infiltration with extension of pyogranulomatous inflammation to the cornea, choroid, ciliary body, and orbital fat. Levels of plasma anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies were not statistically significant to those of 13 healthy dogs. Further research is warranted to investigate the presence and role of anti-neutrophil antibodies in canine necrotizing scleritis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The pathological features, morphological organization, and clinical behavior of canine hemangiosarcomas are virtually indistinct from those of human angiosarcomas. Overall survival with current standard-of-care approaches remains dismal for both humans and dogs, and each is likely to succumb to their disease within a short duration. While angiosarcomas in humans are extremely rare, limiting their study and treatment options, canine hemangiosarcomas occur frequently. Therefore, studies of these sarcomas in dogs can be used to advance treatment approaches for both patient groups. Emerging data suggest that angiosarcomas and hemangiosarcomas utilize beta adrenergic signaling to drive their progression by regulating the tumor cell niche and fine-tuning cellular responses within the tumor microenvironment. These discoveries indicate that inhibition of beta adrenergic signaling could serve as an Achilles heel for these tumors and emphasize the need to design therapeutic strategies that target tumor cell and stromal cell constituents. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries and present new hypotheses regarding the roles of beta adrenergic signaling in angiosarcomas and hemangiosarcomas. Because the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is well established in human and veterinary medicine, beta blockade could provide an immediate adjunct therapy for treatment along with a tangible opportunity to improve upon the outcomes of both humans and dogs with these diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29061947</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Comparative Analysis of Tat-Dependent and Tat-Deficient Natural Lentiviruses.</Title>	<Abstract>The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in infected humans has resulted in a global pandemic that has killed millions. HIV-1 and HIV-2 belong to the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family. This genus also includes viruses that infect other vertebrate animals, among them caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and Maedi-Visna virus (MVV), the prototypes of a heterogeneous group of viruses known as small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), affecting both goat and sheep worldwide. Despite their long host-SRLV natural history, SRLVs were never found to be responsible for immunodeficiency in contrast to primate lentiviruses. SRLVs only replicate productively in monocytes/macrophages in infected animals but not in CD4+ T cells. The focus of this review is to examine and compare the biological and pathological properties of SRLVs as prototypic Tat-independent lentiviruses with HIV-1 as prototypic Tat-dependent lentiviruses. Results from this analysis will help to improve the understanding of why and how these two prototypic lentiviruses evolved in opposite directions in term of virulence and pathogenicity. Results may also help develop new strategies based on the attenuation of SRLVs to control the highly pathogenic HIV-1 in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The majority of the compounds identified were fatty (26% of total identified compounds), organic (19%), and amino (16%) acids. We were able to differentiate male and female penguins with 96.6% accuracy on the basis of 12 metabolites, most of which are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These included 2-oxoglutarate, erythronic acid, GABA, mannitol, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and serine and six metabolites present in higher concentrations in females compared to males (2-aminoadipic acid, O-phosphorylethanolamine, glycerol 2-phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, pantothenic acid, and creatinine). Of these, 2-oxoglutarate and glycerol 3-phosphate were key metabolites distinguishing gender. Our results indicated that male and female Humboldt Penguins were characterized by differing metabolic states. Such differences could be important to individual and brood survival in times of environmental stress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While cutaneous masses are often treatable by tumor excision, visceral tumors are almost always incurable. Treatment advances for this disease have been limited due to a poor understanding of the overall tumor biology. Based upon its histological appearance, HSA has been presumed to originate from transformed endothelial cells; however, accumulating data now suggest a pluripotent bone marrow progenitor as the cell of origin for this disease. More recently, the identification of a novel subclassification of HSAs has provided a foundation to further our understanding of the cellular characteristics of HSA tumor cells, along with those of the cells comprising the tumor microenvironment. These discoveries hold promise for the development of new approaches to improve treatments for canine HSA, as well as to establish the utility of this disease as a spontaneous model to understand the pathogenesis and develop new treatments for vascular tumors of humans. In this review, we will provide a brief historical perspective and pathobiology of canine HSA, along with a focus on the recent advances in the molecular and cellular understanding of these tumors. In addition, future directions that should continue to improve our understanding of HSA pathogenesis will be discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29061950</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as A Sentinel for Exposure to Mercury in Humans: Closing the Loop.</Title>	<Abstract>Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous global contaminant with important public health implications. Mercury is released from a variety of anthropogenic, industrial processes, enters the earth's atmosphere and is re-deposited onto the earth's surface in rainfall. Much of this Hg enters the oceans which cover the majority of the earth's surface. In the marine environment, inorganic Hg is converted to the most toxic form of the element, methylmercury, and biomagnified through the trophic levels of the food web. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the apex predator in many estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Due to their long life span and trophic position, bottlenose dolphins bioaccumulate high concentrations of contaminants including Hg, thus making them an important sentinel species for ecosystem and public health. Bottlenose dolphins in Florida bioaccumulate high concentrations of Hg in their blood, skin and internal organs. The concentrations of Hg in blood and skin of bottlenose dolphins of the Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) are among the highest reported world-wide. In previous studies, we demonstrated associations between concentrations of total Hg in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins and markers of endocrine, renal, hepatic, hematologic and immune system dysfunction. The predominant manifestation of exposure to mercury in humans is neurotoxicity. During the 1950s and 1960s, residents of Minamata bay, Japan were exposed to high concentrations of methyl mercury as the result of ingestion of fish and shellfish that had become contaminated in this infamous environmental disaster. Affected adults had severe motor and sensory abnormalities often leading to death. Methyl mercury crosses the placenta during pregnancy. Children exposed in utero were born with multiple congenital anomalies and also suffered from neurologic disorders. Significantly, local cats that consumed Hg contaminated fish developed severe signs of neurotoxicity which led to their subsequent description as the "dancing cats of Minamata bay". Unfortunately, the cause of these strange manifestations in cats was not recognized in time to prevent hundreds of additional cases from occurring. More recent studies have shown that exposure to mercury as a result of seafood consumption during pregnancy may result in multiple cognitive and neurodevelopmental effects in children. The levels of mercury found in bottlenose dolphins and the health effects we identified alerted us to the possibility of an important public health hazard. The IRL occupies 40 percent of the east coast of Florida and is bordered by counties with approximately 2.5 million human inhabitants. Therefore, we hypothesized that local inhabitants in communities bordering the IRL could be at risk of exposure to Hg from the consumption of fish and shellfish. We measured hair Hg in 135 local residents and found a mean concentration of 1.53 &#181;g/g which was higher than that from previous studies of sport fishermen and coastal residents in other states. Over 50% of participants had a hair Hg concentration which exceeded the U.S. EPA exposure guideline. Hair Hg concentration was directly related to the frequency of seafood consumption and to the proportion of fish and shellfish obtained from local recreational sources. This study clearly exemplifies the importance of an animal sentinel in identifying a public health hazard and is virtually unique in "closing the loop" between animal and human health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While current excitement in the field of immunotherapy is being driven by several major breakthroughs including immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, these advances stem from a foundation of pivotal studies demonstrating the immune systems role in tumor control and eradication. The following will be a succinct review on veterinary cancer immunotherapy as it pertains to manipulation of the innate immune system to control tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we will provide an update on recent progress in our understanding of the innate immune system in veterinary tumor immunology, and how these gains may lead to novel therapies for the treatment of cancer in companion animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Experiment 1 was conducted with 35 dairy cows to investigate the effects of various doses of oral supplemented nicotinic acid (NA) either in differing galenic forms (non-rumen protected (nRP) vs. rumen protected form (RP)) on serum niacin concentrations. Experiment 2 was designed as a pharmacokinetic study examining the serum niacin kinetics over 24 h after giving a single oral bolus of 24 g nRP or RP NA admixed in either pelleted or ground concentrate. In both experiments, only the niacin vitamer nicotinamide (NAM) was detected. Results of experiment 1 showed that both galenic forms at a dose of 24 g/cow daily elevated NAM concentrations at the beginning of the experiment. Despite a daily supplementation, NAM concentrations decreased continuously towards the end of the experiment which was more steeply in nRP NA (p = 0.03). On experimental day 21, NAM concentrations were higher when feeding RP NA (p = 0.03) and the highest dose (24 g/day and cow) (p &lt; 0.01). Results of experiment 2 indicated that nRP and RP were characterized by similar pharmacokinetic profiles resulting in similar areas under the curves as a net result of the kinetic counterbalancing alterations. Pelleting seemed not to influence the relative bioavailability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high in vitro susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of studies on antiviral treatment of FIV, focusing on commercially available compounds for human or animal use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This trend is prevalent in households with children who prefer health-certified meat products. Our study compares meat consumption habits in households with and without children or adolescences (0-18 years). A structured questionnaire was distributed to 401 retail purchasers at 12 different points of sales of meat in the Piedmont region in northwest Italy. Socio-demographic variables and quantitative-qualitative meat consumption habits of retail purchasers were investigated. One part of the questionnaire analyzed the relative importance of 12 meat choice purchasing attributes by employing the Best-Worst scaling methodology, a type of choice experiment. Our research found that households without children (subset B) have higher weekly meat consumption habits than those with children (subset A). Alternatively, the households with children (subset A) have a diet characterized by a greater variety of protein sources, such as legumes and fish. Both of the considered subsets preferred trusted butchers for meat buying, with supermarkets as a second choice. However, only consumers of subset A bought meat from farm butchers. Our team performed a consumer analysis to identify meat consumption patterns in the two considered subsets. Simultaneously, a Best-Worst analysis evidenced several choice attributes with different relevance for the two investigated samples segmentation in three clusters of purchase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the amount and source of dietary starch may affect digestibility and metabolism of other macronutrients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of 3 commercial cat diets on in vivo and in vitro energy and macronutrient digestibility, and to analyze the accuracy of the modified Atwater equation. Dietary treatments differed in their perceived glycemic response (PGR) based on ingredient composition and carbohydrate content (34.1, 29.5, and 23.6% nitrogen-free extract for High, Medium, and LowPGR, respectively). A replicated 3 &#215; 3 Latin square design was used, with 3 diets and 3 periods. In vivo apparent protein, fat, and organic matter digestibility differed among diets, while apparent dry matter digestibility did not. Cats were able to efficiently digest and absorb macronutrients from all diets. Furthermore, the modified Atwater equation underestimated measured metabolizable energy by approximately 12%. Thus, the modified Atwater equation does not accurately determine the metabolizable energy of high quality feline diets. Further research should focus on understanding carbohydrate metabolism in cats, and establishing an equation that accurately predicts the metabolizable energy of feline diets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29140289</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Cats and Carbohydrates: The Carnivore Fantasy?</Title>	<Abstract>The domestic cat's wild ancestors are obligate carnivores that consume prey containing only minimal amounts of carbohydrates. Evolutionary events adapted the cat's metabolism and physiology to this diet strictly composed of animal tissues and led to unique digestive and metabolic peculiarities of carbohydrate metabolism. The domestic cat still closely resembles its wild ancestor. Although the carnivore connection of domestic cats is well recognised, little is known about the precise nutrient profile to which the digestive physiology and metabolism of the cat have adapted throughout evolution. Moreover, studies show that domestic cats balance macronutrient intake by selecting low-carbohydrate foods. The fact that cats evolved consuming low-carbohydrate prey has led to speculations that high-carbohydrate diets could be detrimental for a cat's health. More specifically, it has been suggested that excess carbohydrates could lead to feline obesity and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the chances for remission of diabetes mellitus are higher in cats that consume a low-carbohydrate diet. This literature review will summarise current carbohydrate knowledge pertaining to digestion, absorption and metabolism of carbohydrates, food selection and macronutrient balancing in healthy, obese and diabetic cats, as well as the role of carbohydrates in prevention and treatment of obesity and diabetes mellitus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29144407</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Effects of Various Weather Conditions as a Potential Ischemic Stroke Trigger in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, and is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability worldwide. There are at least 795,000 new or recurrent strokes each year, and approximately 85% of all stroke occurrences are ischemic. Unfortunately, companion animals are also at risk for ischemic stroke. Although the exact incidence of ischemic stroke in companion animals is unknown, some studies, and the veterinary information network (VIN), report that approximately 3% of neurological case referrals are due to a stroke. There is a long list of predisposing factors associated with the risk of ischemic stroke in both humans and canines; however, these factors do not explain why a stroke happens at a particular time on a particular day. Our understanding of these potential stroke "triggers" is limited, and the effect of transient environmental exposures may be one such "trigger". The present study investigated the extent to which the natural occurrence of canine ischemic stroke was related to the weather conditions in the time-period immediately preceding the onset of stroke. The results of the present study demonstrated that the change in weather conditions could be a potential stroke trigger, with the strokes evaluated occurring after periods of rapid, large fluctuations in weather conditions. There are currently no epidemiological data on the seasonal variability of ischemic stroke in dogs, and determining whether canine stroke parallels human stroke would further validate the use of companion dogs as an appropriate naturally occurring model.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to characterize ceftiofur (TIO)- or cefotaxime (FOX)-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from dairy cow manure. Twenty-four manure samples were collected from four farms and incubated under anaerobic conditions for 20 weeks at 4 &#176;C or at 25 &#176;C. A total of 37 TIO- or FOX-resistant E. coli were isolated from two of the four farms to determine their susceptibility to 14 antibiotics. Among the 37 resistant E. coli, 10 different serotypes were identified, with O8:H1 being the predominant serotype (n = 17). Five isolates belonged to each of serotypes O9:NM and O153:H42, respectively. All 37 cephalosporin resistant isolates were multi-resistant with the most prevalent resistance spectrum being amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-ampicillin-cefoxitin-ceftiofur-ceftriaxone-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-sulfisoxazole-tetracycline-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The genomes of 18 selected isolates were then sequenced and compared to 14 selected human pathogenic E. coli reference genomes obtained from public repositories using different bioinformatics approaches. As expected, all 18 sequenced isolates carried at least one &#946;-lactamase bla gene: TEM-1, TEM-81, CTX-M115, CTX-M15, OXA-1, or CMY-2. Several other antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence determinants were detected in the sequenced isolates and all of them harbored antimicrobial resistance plasmids belonging to classic Inc groups. Our results confirm the presence of diverse ESBL producing E. coli isolates in dairy cow manure stored for a short period of time. Such manure might constitute a reservoir of resistance and virulence genes for other bacteria that share the same environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to characterise the common conditions of rabbits and guinea pigs, and to compare these with the topics found in the published literature. Information about the common conditions seen in rabbits and guinea pigs in clinical practice was obtained from a survey of UK veterinarians. The common conditions seen were compared with results from a structured literature search. Conditions relating to the dental (29.9%), and skin (37.6%) body systems were commonly nominated by veterinarians for rabbits and guinea pigs, respectively. A total of 655 rabbit and 1086 guinea pig citations were examined and there appeared to be a mismatch between the conditions nominated in the veterinary questionnaire, and those found in the literature. This is the first time that the published literature has been compared to the nominated caseload of veterinarians in practice, and there is concern that the literature about rabbits and guinea pigs may not be representative of, or relevant to the caseload seen in clinical practice. This is of importance for clinicians being able to apply an objective, evidence-based approach. The publishing of clinically-relevant, research-based evidence should be prioritised.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A preliminary evaluation was carried out in order to assess the effect of the program on teachers' perception of children's difficulties (e.g., peer relationship problems) and strengths (prosocial behaviors) by means of a brief behavioral screening tool, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Teacher version). Overall results indicate that, by means of the recognition of the dogs' behavior and non-verbal communication, children were able to express their emotions and to show behaviors that had not been recognized by the teachers prior to the intervention. In particular, the SDQ Total Difficulties scores suggest that the teacher had increased awareness of the students' difficulties as a result of the dog-assisted program. Overall, the presence of animals in the educational environment may provide enjoyment and hands-on educational experiences, enhanced psychological wellbeing, and increased empathy and socio-emotional development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29194349</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Polymorphism Analysis of Ch1 and Ch2 Genes in the Siberian Cat.</Title>	<Abstract>Cats are usually spreaders of allergens that are critical for sensitive people; the Siberian cat is a breed supposed to be low level allergenic, according to some breeders' statements. The sequence of the two genes, namely Ch1 and Ch2, that code for the allergen Fel d 1, the major allergen responsible for outbreaks of allergy symptoms, is not yet known in the Siberian cat, and finding this was the aim of our investigation. Notably, our work is the first survey of the genetic structure of these genes in Siberian cats. The comparison of the sequences of Siberian cats, non-Siberian cats, and sequences present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed a considerable number of mutations; some of those detected in the Siberian cat, due to their position in exon regions, could affect the Fel d 1 allergenic properties. Therefore, further investigations are recommended to assess if the identified mutations can be responsible for a reduced-allergen synthesis and can be used as markers for selection of low level allergenic cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29194353</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Reproductive Disorders and Leptospirosis: A Case Study in a Mixed-Species Farm (Cattle and Swine).</Title>	<Abstract>Animal leptospirosis, exempt in rodents, manifests as peculiar biology where the animal can function, simultaneously or not, as a susceptible host or reservoir. In the first case, clinical symptoms are likely. In the second case, infection is subclinical and manifestations are mild or absent. Mild clinical symptoms encompass reproductive failure in production animals for host-adapted Leptospira sp. serovars. This work presents a study on Leptospira sp. infection in a mixed-species (bovine and swine) farm with documented reproductive disorders in the cattle unit. A long calving interval (above 450 days) was the hallmark observed in cows. Some cows (2/26 tested) presented a high titre of antibodies against Leptospira sp. serogroup Sejroe, but the overall within-herd prevalence was low (11.5% and 7.7% for cut-off titres of 1:30 and 1:100, respectively). The in-herd prevalence of leptospirosis in the sow unit (determined for 113/140 animals) was high when using a lowered cut-off threshold (32.7% vs. 1.8% for cut-off titre of 1:30 and 1:100, respectively). In this unit, the most prevalent serogroup was Autumnalis. The final diagnostic confirmation of Leptospira sp. maintenance within the farm was obtained through detection by PCR of Leptospira sp. DNA in an aborted swine litter. Despite the fact that a common causative infective agent was diagnosed in both species, the direct link between the two animal units was not found. Factors such as drinking from the same water source and the use of manure prepared with the swine slurry might raise suspicion of a possible cross-contamination between the two units. In conclusion, this work suggests that leptospirosis be included in the differential diagnosis of reproductive disorders and spontaneous abortions in production animals and provides data that justify the use of a lowered threshold cut-off for herd diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29215593</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Risk Factors Associated with Brucella Seropositivity in Sheep and Goats in Duhok Province, Iraq.</Title>	<Abstract>Sera from 432 small ruminants (335 sheep and 97 goats) from 72 farms in Duhok Province, northern Iraq, were collected to investigate risk factors associated with brucellosis seropositivity. Serum samples were tested using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Using parallel interpretation, RBT and iELISA results showed that 31.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.1, 36.3) of sheep and 34.0% (95% CI: 24.7, 44.3) of goats had antibodies against Brucella in the study area. A random-effects multivariable logistic regression model indicated that a higher chance of being seropositive (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95% 1.4; 2.2) was associated with an increase in the age of animals. The odds of Brucella seropositivity in flocks where sheep and goats grazed together was 2.0 times higher (95% CI: 1.08; 3.9) compared to flocks where sheep and goats grazed separately. The odds of Brucella seropositivity in small ruminants was 2.2 higher (95% CI: 1.2; 4.3) for animals originating from farms with a history of goat abortion in the preceding 12 months. In contrast, for every 1000 Iraqi Dinars (~0.85 US Dollar) spent by the farmers on control of Brucella in their flocks, the odds of Brucella seropositivity decreased significantly (OR = 0.9, p-value = 0.021). The final model also indicated significant differences in Brucella seropositivity between the different districts of Duhok Province. This study provides a contribution to the epidemiology of brucellosis in small ruminants in northern Iraq.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The use of animal models is critical in identifying early disease markers and developing and testing chemotherapies. We describe the microscopic characteristics of the normally functioning laying hen ovary and proximal oviduct to establish baselines from which lesions associated with ovarian cancer can be more readily identified. Ovaries and oviducts were collected from 18-month-old laying hens (n = 18) and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections were examined by light microscopy. Both post-ovulatory follicular regression and atresia of small follicles produce remnant clusters of vacuolated cells with no histological evidence that scar tissue persists. Infiltrates of heterophils are associated with atresia of small follicles, a relationship not previously documented in laying hen ovaries. Because these tissues can be mistaken for cancerous lesions, we present a detailed histological description of remnant Wolffian tissues in the laying hen ovary. Immunohistochemical staining for pancytokeratin produced a positive response in ovarian surface epithelium and staining for vimentin produced a positive response in granulosa cells of follicles. Epithelial cells lining glands of the remnant epo&#246;phoron had a positive response to both pancytokeratin and vimentin, a result also observed in women.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29240673</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Urinary Fractional Excretion of Phosphorus in Dogs with Spontaneous Chronic Kidney Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>The increase of urinary fractional excretion of phosphorus (uFEP) may indicate phosphorus retention before the onset of hyperphosphatemia in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The hypothesis of this study is whether uFEP may increase during the early stage of CKD as a compensatory mechanism to prevent hyperphosphatemia as well as whether hyperphosphatemia in the late stages is associated with increase or decrease in uFEP in dogs with naturally occurring CKD; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the uFEP in CKD dogs with different stages. Forty-nine CKD dogs were included, and they were divided into stage 1 (serum creatinine &lt; 1.4 mg/dL), stage 2 (serum creatinine 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL), stage 3 (serum creatinine 2.1 to 5.0 mg/dL) and stage 4 (serum creatinine &gt; 5.0 mg/dL), according to the IRIS staging criteria. The stage 3 was subdivided into stage 3-A (serum creatinine 2.1 to 3.5 mg/dL) and stage 3-B (serum creatinine 3.6 to 5.0 mg/dL). The control group comprised 10 dogs, and uFEP &#8804; 40% was considered as normal. A progressive increase in uFEP along the progression of CKD was found. However, similar results of uFEP levels were observed in late CKD, since there were no differences between stages 3 (A, B) and 4. Interestingly, some CKD dogs with stage 4 showed normal or reduced uFEP, besides hyperphosphatemia; conversely, some dogs in early CKD had increased uFEP values and normophosphatemia. Our findings suggest that uFEP may act as a compensatory mechanism to avoid the onset of hyperphosphatemia in early CKD, but not in later stages. uFEP assessment may be considered as an additional tool for the diagnostic and monitoring of phosphate disorders in dogs with CKD, since it may help to identify disturbances of phosphorus balance. More studies are needed to elucidate the role of uFEP in phosphorus homeostasis in dogs with CKD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Veterinarians and the clinics for whom they work routinely establish collaborations with multiple and varied stakeholders. This might include a laboratory for processing samples and the corresponding courier company needed to deliver samples to the lab or a partnership with a local dog rescue organization for whom discounted rates are offered. One community partnership that stands to benefit both the clinic and the community agency, is for veterinarians to work in tandem with a local canine-assisted therapy program. The benefits to such an alliance are multifold and address aspects of veterinary medicine including client recruitment, community education, and access to a network of devoted dog enthusiasts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Only two cases of oral SCC have been reported in Lynx species (Lynx rufus and Lynx canadensis), at mandibular and gingival sites. In this study, we describe the first report of tongue SCC in a 15 years old female European lynx (Lynx lynx), along with viral investigations. Necropsy and histological analysis were performed and the presence of papillomavirus (PV) infection was investigated by ultrastructural and molecular methods. The lardaceous mass at tongue level was histologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated SCC. Typical microscopical features of SCC were also found in the retropharyngeal lymph node and at the pulmonary level. Neither viral DNA by PCR, nor viral particles by transmission electron microscopy were found. Despite that PV infection is associated with Felidae, this work reports the first description of tongue SCC in Lynx species, but no evidence of PV infection, suggesting that PV may not be involved in development of SCC in bobcat species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To investigate the impact of IBH in the field, an exploratory pilot study was conducted with equine stakeholders in one region of central England. Nine semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with horse owners and an equine veterinarian. The aim was to gain an understanding of experiences with IBH, and to gauge opinions on the value of the various management strategies horse owners use to control IBH. Awareness of IBH was generally high, particularly in those individuals who had previous experience with the condition. Those with previous experience of IBH commented on the significant effect on daily routines, and the associated cost implications. Most participants supported an integrated approach to hypersensitivity management, and this most commonly involved a combination of physical barriers and chemical repellents, but sometimes included feed supplementation. Overall, attitudes towards IBH suggested that the condition is a notable welfare and economic concern for stakeholders, but veterinary involvement tended to only be in more severe cases. Further research is required in the future to improve understanding, management and potential treatment of this condition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>29346332</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Owners and Veterinary Surgeons in the United Kingdom Disagree about What Should Happen during a Small Animal Vaccination Consultation.</Title>	<Abstract>Dog and cat vaccination consultations are a common part of small animal practice in the United Kingdom. Few data are available describing what happens during those consultations or what participants think about their content. The aim of this novel study was to investigate the attitudes of dog and cat owners and veterinary surgeons towards the content of small animal vaccination consultations. Telephone interviews with veterinary surgeons and pet owners captured rich qualitative data. Thematic analysis was performed to identify key themes. This study reports the theme describing attitudes towards the content of the consultation. Diverse preferences exist for what should be prioritised during vaccination consultations, and mismatched expectations may lead to negative experiences. Vaccination consultations for puppies and kittens were described to have a relatively standardised structure with an educational and preventative healthcare focus. In contrast, adult pet vaccination consultations were described to focus on current physical health problems with only limited discussion of preventative healthcare topics. This first qualitative exploration of UK vaccination consultation expectations suggests that the content and consistency of adult pet vaccination consultations may not meet the needs or expectations of all participants. Redefining preventative healthcare to include all preventable conditions may benefit owners, pets and veterinary surgeons, and may help to provide a clearer structure for adult pet vaccination consultations. This study represents a significant advance our understanding of this consultation type.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 10-year-old female intact Rottweiler presented to the School of Veterinary Medicine, Trinidad with buphthalmia and pain in the left eye. The cornea of the left eye appeared diffusely opaque with a conjunctival mucopurulent ocular discharge. A thorough ophthalmic assessment identified an intraocular proliferative tumor to which a unilateral enucleation was performed, however the animal died soon after. Post mortem examination and light microscopy revealed that the intraocular lesion with visceral macro-metastases was in fact a histiocytic sarcoma. Further to this, immune-phenotyping was performed to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated histiocytic sarcoma. This is the first time such a tumor has been diagnosed in Trinidad and Tobago.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, it is still unclear how biofilms are related to mastitis infections in dairy cattle. In this study, a comparison between two tests for biofilm formation and the association between biofilm and the presence of genes associated with biofilm formation were investigated for 92 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from clinical mastitis cases. Congo red agar (CRA) and microtitre test assay (MTA) in vitro phenotypic tests were used to evaluate biofilm formation. The presence of icaA, icaD, and bap genes associated with biofilm formation was confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction. Results show that most of the S. aureus isolates, though not possessing one of the biofilm-forming genes, were able to produce biofilms. MTA was more frequently positive in identifying biofilm-forming isolates than CRA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on a recombinant multi-antigen of Babesia bovis (rMABbO) was developed for detection of antibodies in bovines suspected of infection with this parasite. The multi-antigen comprises gene fragments of three previously characterized B. bovis antigens: MSA-2c, RAP-1 and the Heat Shock protein 20 that are well-conserved among geographically distant strains. The cutoff value for the new rMABbo-iELISA was determined using 75 known-positive and 300 known-negative bovine sera previously tested for antibodies to B. bovis by the gold-standard ELISA which uses a merozoite lysate. A cutoff value of &#8805;35% was determined in these samples by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, showing a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 94.3%. The rMABbo-iELISA was further tested in a blind trial using an additional set of 263 field bovine sera from enzootic and tick-free regions of Argentina. Results showed a good agreement with the gold standard test with a Cohen's kappa value of 0.76. Finally, the prevalence of bovine babesiosis in different tick enzootic regions of Argentina was analyzed where seropositivity values among 68-80% were obtained. A certain level of cross reaction was observed when samples from B. bigemina infected cattle were analyzed with the new test, which can be attributed to shared epitopes between 2 of the 3 antigens. This new rMABbo-iELISA could be considered a simpler alternative to detect anti Babesia spp. antibodies and appears to be well suited to perform epidemiological surveys at the herd level in regions where ticks are present.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is currently no information on the presence and circulation of pathogens in backyard poultry farms in T&amp;T, and little is known in relation to the potential risks of spread of these pathogens to the commercial poultry sector. In order to address this, serum samples were collected from 41 chickens on five backyard farms taken from selected locations in Trinidad. Samples were tested for antibodies to seven priority pathogens of poultry by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibodies were detected in 65% (CI 95%: 50-78%) of the sampled birds for Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), 67.5% (CI 95%: 52-80%) for Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), 10% (CI 95%: 4-23%) for Newcastle disease virus (NDV), 0% (CI 95%: 0-0%) for Avian influenza virus (AIV), 0% (CI 95%: 0-0%) for West Nile virus (WNV), 31.7% (CI 95%: 20-47%) for Mycoplasm gallisepticum/synoviae and 0% (CI 95%: 0-0%) for Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis. These results reveal the presence and circulation of important pathogens of poultry in selected backyard farms in Trinidad. The results provide important information which should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks of pathogen transmission between commercial and backyard poultry farms, as well as between poultry and wild birds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Species of coccidia found in chickens include Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria brunetti, Eimeria maxima, Eimeria mitis, Eimeria necatrix, Eimeria praecox, and Eimeria tenella. In recent years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed to provide accurate and rapid identification of the seven known Eimeria species of chickens. The aim of this study was to use species-specific real-time PCR (qPCR) to identify which of the seven Eimeria species are present in Trinidad poultry. Seventeen pooled fecal samples were collected from 6 broiler farms (2-5 pens per farm) across Trinidad. Feces were also collected from birds showing clinical signs of coccidiosis in two live bird markets (pluck shops). qPCR revealed the presence of five species of Eimeria (E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. mitis, E. necatrix, and E. tenella), but not E. brunetti or E. praecox. Mixed infections were detected on all broiler farms, and DNA of two highly pathogenic Eimeria species (E. tenella and E.necatrix) was detected in feces taken from clinically sick birds sampled from the two pluck shops.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Caribbean region, which boasts some of the highest rates of poultry consumption in the world, is no exception. This review summarizes evidence for the circulation and spread of eight high-priority, economically important poultry viruses across the Caribbean region. Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), fowl adenovirus group 1 (FADV Gp1), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) were selected for review. This review of serological, molecular, and phylogenetic studies across Caribbean countries reveals evidence for sporadic outbreaks of respiratory disease caused by notifiable viral pathogens (AIV, IBV, NDV, and ILTV), as well as outbreaks of diseases caused by immunosuppressive viral pathogens (IBDV and FADV Gp1). This review highlights the need to strengthen current levels of surveillance and reporting for poultry diseases in domestic and wild bird populations across the Caribbean, as well as the need to strengthen the diagnostic capacity and capability of Caribbean national veterinary diagnostic laboratories.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Firstly, we have investigated the effects of runs of homozygosity (ROH) with the appearance of scrotal hernias, followed by a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). The phenotype classification was based on visual appearance of scrotal hernias. Each affected animal was matched to a healthy control from the same pen. In the total, 68 animals were genotyped using the Porcine SNP60 Beadchip, out of those, 41 animals had the presence of hernias and 27 were healthy animals. Fifteen animals were removed from the analysis due to differences in genetic background, leaving 18 healthy animals and 35 piglets with scrotal hernia. Further, the detection of extended haplotypes shared ROH were conducted for health (control) and affected (case) animals and a permutation test was used to test whether the ROH segments were more frequent in case/case pairs than non-case/case pairs. Using the ROH, we have identified an association (p = 0.019) on chromosome 2(SSC2) being segregated on animals with the presence of scrotal hernias. Using a GWAS, a region composed by 3 SNPs on the sexual chromosome X (SSCX) were associated with scrotal hernias (p &lt; 1.6 &#215; 10[-5]), this region harbors the Androgen Receptor Gene (AR).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Owners of 20 sheep breeding and finishing farms known to be clinically affected by ovine Johne's disease in New Zealand participated in the study and were monitored for up to two years. Farms were categorized as fine-wool (Merino, Half-Bred, Corriedale, n = 15), and other breeds (Romney, composite breeds, n = 5). Ovine JD was confirmed by gross- and histo-pathology in 358 ewes culled due to chronic progressive wasting. An additional 228 ewes with low body condition score (BCS), but not targeted for culling, were tested with ELISA to estimate the proportion of OJD in ewes in the lower 5% BCS of the flock. Calculations were done separately for fine-wool and other breeds. Based on the data, mortality due to OJD, its associated cost and the benefit-cost of vaccination were evaluated for a hypothetical farm with 2000 ewes by stochastic simulation. Total ewe mortality was similar in fine-wool and other breeds, but the estimated mortality due to OJD was 2.7 times as high in fine-wool (median 1.8%, interquartile range IQR 1.2-2.7%) than other breeds (median 0.69%, IQR 0.3-1.2%), but with large variation between farms. ELISA results demonstrated fine-wool sheep had a higher seroprevalence than other breeds (39%, 95% CI 18-61% vs. 9%, 95% CI 0-22%). Stochastic modelling indicated that the average annual cost of mortality due to OJD in a flock of 2000 ewes was NZD 13,100 (IQR 8900-18,600) in fine-wool and NZD 4300 (IQR 2200-7600) in other breeds. Vaccinating replacement lambs against OJD may be cost-effective in most flocks when the pre-vaccination annual ewe mortality due to OJD is &gt;1%. To make the best-informed decision about vaccination it is therefore essential for farmers to accurately diagnose OJD to establish incidence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease poses a remarkable economic burden for both animals and humans. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire survey among livestock farmers in Basrah province, southern Iraq, in order to evaluate their knowledge and awareness about CE, and to understand some of the risky practices that could contribute to spread and persistence of such disease. Of the interviewed participants (N = 314), 27.4% owned dogs on their farms. Among farmers owning dogs, 76.7% (66/86) never tied up their dogs, and 43% (37/86) indicated feeding uncooked animal viscera to their dogs. The majority (96.5%) of the farmers indicated that they did not de-worm their dogs at all. Only 9.8% (31/314) of the respondents indicated eating raw leafy vegetables without washing. Added to that, 32% of the interviewees indicated that they source water for domestic use from a river; meanwhile 94.3% (296/314) of them do not boil water before using it for domestic purposes. Half of the interviewed livestock farmers in Basrah were not aware about how humans get infected with CE disease, and 41.4% (130/314) did not even realize that CE is a dangerous disease to human health. Almost one in three of the respondents who owned dogs on their farms viewed de-worming of their dogs as a low priority practice. This study highlights the gap in knowledge and awareness about CE among the study population. Risky practices associated with dog keeping management and food and water handling practices were identified. The insight from this research could be used to improve the delivery of a health education message relevant to cystic echinococcosis control at the human-animal interface in Iraq.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite leading authorities in human and animal health uniting to advance effective and humane rabies control, some governments resort to lethal methods, which are unethical, often inhumane and ineffective. To end the inhumane culling of dogs in response to rabies, World Animal Protection launched 'Red Collar'; a five-year campaign (2011-2016) that worked with governments to promote the implementation of mass dog vaccination for rabies control. We present the findings from a qualitative evaluation of 'Red Collar', conducted both regionally and with national focus on Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Zanzibar, Tanzania. Through semi-structured interviews and written contributions from stakeholders (n = 54), we compared perceptions of changes with stated campaign goals to capture recommendations for future work. The campaign successfully generated momentum for implementation of mass dog vaccination by targeted governments. Lessons learned were established: Value of a consistent animal welfare 'voice'; the need to explore the motivations behind culling; the need to capacity build; time required for the 'ripple effect' to inspire humane control in other countries; importance of monitoring and evaluation of indicators; time and effort required for exit strategies and prior preparation for a robust response to culling.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29415432</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Impact of RNA Degradation on Viral Diagnosis: An Understated but Essential Step for the Successful Establishment of a Diagnosis Network.</Title>	<Abstract>The current global conditions, which include intensive globalization, climate changes, and viral evolution among other factors, have led to an increased emergence of viruses and new viral diseases; RNA viruses are key drivers of this evolution. Laboratory networks that are linked to central reference laboratories are required to conduct both active and passive environmental surveillance of this complicated global viral environment. These tasks require a continuous exchange of strains or field samples between different diagnostic laboratories. The shipment of these samples on dry ice represents both a biological hazard and a general health risk. Moreover, the requirement to ship on dry ice could be hampered by high costs, particularly in underdeveloped countries or regions located far from each other. To solve these issues, the shipment of RNA isolated from viral suspensions or directly from field samples could be a useful way to share viral genetic material. However, extracted RNA stored in aqueous solutions, even at -70 &#176;C, is highly prone to degradation. The current study evaluated different RNA storage conditions for safety and feasibility for future use in molecular diagnostics. The in vitro RNA-transcripts obtained from an inactivated highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus was used as a model. The role of secondary structures in the protection of the RNA was also explored. Of the conditions evaluated, the dry pellet matrix was best able to protect viral RNA under extreme storage conditions. This method is safe, cost-effective and assures the integrity of RNA samples for reliable molecular diagnosis. This study aligns with the globally significant "Global One Health" paradigm, especially with respect to the diagnosis of emerging diseases that require confirmation by reference laboratories.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Impacts of the perceived length of UK preventative healthcare consultations have not previously been described. The aim of this novel study was to provide the first qualitative description of owner and veterinary surgeon reflections on time during preventative healthcare consultations. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 14 veterinary surgeons and 15 owners about all aspects of canine and feline preventative healthcare consultations. These qualitative data were thematically analysed, and four key themes identified. This paper describes the theme relating to time and consultation length. Patient, owner, veterinary surgeon and practice variables were recalled to impact the actual, versus allocated, length of a preventative healthcare consultation. Preventative healthcare consultations involving young, old and multi-morbid animals and new veterinary surgeon-owner partnerships appear particularly susceptible to time pressures. Owners and veterinary surgeons recalled rushing and minimizing discussions to keep consultations within their allocated time. The impact of the pace, content and duration of a preventative healthcare consultation may be influential factors in consultation satisfaction. These interviews provide an important insight into the complex nature of preventative healthcare consultations and the behaviour of participants under different perceived time pressures. These data may be of interest and relevance to all stakeholders in dog and cat preventative healthcare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although the survival of PEDV under various pHs and temperatures has been studied, virus stability on different fomite surfaces under varying temperature conditions has not been explored. Hence, we evaluated the survival of PEDV on inanimate objects routinely used on swine farms such as styrofoam, rubber, plastic, coveralls, and other equipment. The titer of infectious PEDV at 4 &#176;C decreased by only 1 to 2 log during the first 5 days, and the virus was recoverable for up to 15 days on Styrofoam, aluminum, Tyvek[&#174;] coverall, cloth, and plastic. However, viral titers decreased precipitously when stored at room temperature; no virus was detectable after one day on all materials tested. A more sensitive immunoplaque assay was able to detect virus from Styrofoam, metal, and plastic at 20 days post application, representing a 3-log loss of input virus on fomite materials. Recovery of infectious PEDV from Tyvek[&#174;] coverall and rubber was above detection limit at 20 days. Our findings indicate that the type of fomite material and temperatures impact PEDV stability, which is important in understanding the nuances of indirect transmission and epidemiology of PEDV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In livestock, ESBL-E burden was unknown. The aim of this study was estimating the prevalence of ESBL-E on commercial farms in Reunion, Mayotte and Madagascar and genes involved. Secondly, risk factors of ESBL-E occurrence in broiler, beef cattle and pig farms were explored. In 2016-2017, commercial farms were sampled using boot swabs and samples stored at 4 &#176;C before microbiological analysis for phenotypical ESBL-E and gene characterization. A dichotomous questionnaire was performed. Prevalences observed in all production types and territories were high, except for beef cattle in Reunion, which differed significantly. The most common ESBL gene was blaCTX-M-1. Generalized linear models explaining ESBL-E occurrence varied between livestock production sectors and allowed identifying main protective (e.g., water quality control and detergent use for cleaning) and risk factors (e.g., recent antibiotic use, other farmers visiting the exploitation, pet presence). This study is the first to explore tools for antibiotic resistance management in IO farms. It provides interesting hypothesis to explore about antibiotic use in IO territories and ESBL-E transmission between pig, beef cattle and humans in Madagascar.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Such interactions could be either synergistic or antagonistic, which subsequently determines the severity of the disease complex. The intensive rearing methods of poultry are responsible for the marked increase in avian respiratory diseases worldwide. The interaction between avian influenza with other pathogens can guarantee the continuous existence of other avian pathogens, which represents a global concern. A better understanding of the impact of the interaction between avian influenza virus and other avian respiratory pathogens provides a better insight into the respiratory disease complex in poultry and can lead to improved intervention strategies aimed at controlling virus spread.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Whereas the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) technique is the recommended test, the more convenient, direct rapid immunochemistry test (dRIT), as well as the more sensitive, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have recently been employed for the laboratory diagnosis of rabies. We compared the three methods on brain samples from domestic (dog, cat, cattle, buffalo, horse, pig and goat) and wild (leopard, wolf and jackal) animals from various parts of India. Of the 257 samples tested, 167 were positive by all the three tests; in addition, 35 of the 36 decomposed samples were positive by RT-PCR. This is the first study in which such large number of animal samples have been subjected to the three tests simultaneously. The results confirm 100% corroboration between DFA and dRIT, buttress the applicability of dRIT in the simple and rapid diagnosis of rabies in animals, and reaffirm the suitability of RT-PCR for samples unfit for testing either by DFA or dRIT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

TBF may contribute to severe welfare challenges and economic losses in the Norwegian sheep industry. The bacterium causes a persistent infection in sheep and several other animal species. The objective of this study was to investigate whether intrauterine transmission occurs in persistently infected sheep. The study included thirteen 5-6-month-old unmated ewes, of which twelve were experimentally infected with A. phagocytophilum (GenBank acc. no. M73220). Four to six weeks later, all ewes were mated, and nine became pregnant. Blood samples were collected from these ewes and their offspring. If the lamb died, tissue samples were collected. The samples were analyzed with real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the msp2 gene. PCR-positive samples were further analyzed by semi-nested PCR and 16S rDNA sequencing. A total of 20 lambs were born, of which six died within two days. Six newborn lambs (30%) were PCR-positive (qPCR), of which one was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing. The present study indicates that intrauterine transmission of A. phagocytophilum in persistently infected sheep may occur. The importance of these findings for the epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum needs to be further investigated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An improved understanding of Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma marginale variety centrale (A. centrale) transmission, together with improved tools for pathogen detection and characterisation, are required to inform best management practices. Direct detection methods currently in use for A. marginale and A. centrale in South Africa are light microscopic examination of tissue and organ smears, conventional, nested, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, and a reverse line blot hybridisation assay. Of these, qPCR is the most sensitive for detection of A. marginale and A. centrale in South Africa. Serological assays also feature in routine diagnostics, but cross-reactions prevent accurate species identification. Recently, genetic characterisation has confirmed that A. marginale and A. centrale are separate species. Diversity studies targeting Msp1a repeats for A. marginale and Msp1aS repeats for A. centrale have revealed high genetic variation and point to correspondingly high levels of variation in A. marginale outer membrane proteins (OMPs), which have been shown to be potential vaccine candidates in North American studies. Information on these OMPs is lacking for South African A. marginale strains and should be considered in future recombinant vaccine development studies, ultimately informing the development of regional or global vaccines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29518043</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Performance of Three Immune Assays to Assess the Serological Status of Cattle Experimentally Exposed to Mycoplasma bovis.</Title>	<Abstract>Mycoplasma bovis is associated with several clinical syndromes of cattle. Currently, limited information is available on the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of serological assays used for the detection of M. bovis-specific antibodies. Consequently, it is difficult to critically evaluate the outcomes of studies that use these assays. Therefore, the current study used bovine sera sourced from M. bovis exposure studies from three countries to estimate the Se and Sp of two commercial M. bovis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), BIO K302 and BIO K260, and Western blotting. Western blotting had the highest Se estimate of 74% (95% confidence interval (CI): 16-98%), compared to the BIO K302: 47% (95% CI: 10-87%) and BIO K260: 28% (95% CI: 1-92%). However, for Sp, the BIO K302: 96% (95% CI: 87-99%) and the BIO K260: 100% (95% CI: 93-100%) out-performed Western blotting: 88% (95% CI: 56-98%). Western blotting was the best assay for detecting seroconversion, correctly identifying 61% (95% CI: 29-86%) of exposed animals compared to 35% for BIO K302 (95% CI: 21-54%) and 8% for BIO K260 (95% CI: 0-87%). While none of the methods assessed had high Se and Sp, the availability of these estimates will aid in the interpretation of studies that use these assays. The results of this study highlight the difficulties encountered when using serology to detect exposure to M. bovis in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its diagnosis remains a challenge in endemic countries and basically relies on serology. The present study was carried out on two dairy cattle farms allegedly free from brucellosis, but with sporadic cases of abortion. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Brucella (B.) spp. in uterine discharge of seronegative cows after abortion. In farm I, B. melitensis biovar (bv) 3 was cultured from two of five cows after abortion, while in farm II, B. abortus bv 1 was cultured from three of eleven cows after abortion. These cows had been intrauterinely infected but remained seronegative until abortion and seroconverted only thereafter. Shedding of brucellae in uterine discharge of culture positive/seronegative aborting cows is a serious problem resulting in maintenance and further spread of infection. Thus, serosurveys in endemic countries have to be accompanied by molecular detection and/or culture of aborted material to close the diagnostic window and to hinder uncontrolled spread.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The skulls and mandibles were obtained from ten opossums captured for research purposes. The skulls and mandibles were prepared and cleaned using standard method. Some anatomical landmarks of the skulls and mandibles were identified and measured. The results were important for identification of the common opossum via comparison and discussion of our results with that of other marsupial species. Furthermore, the results had clinical importance with regard to regional nerve blocks of the infraorbital, inferior alveolar, and mental nerves for dental extraction and head surgery. This study concluded that by using the anatomical landmarks of the infraorbital and mental foramina it will be easier for the veterinarian surgeons during the application of local anesthetic agent for the infraorbital, inferior alveolar, and mental nerve blocks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the rise in chemical resistance has prompted the investigation of other control methods such as the use of tick vaccines. Proteomic analysis provides valuable information about the possible function and localization of proteins, as candidate vaccine proteins are often either secreted or localized on the cell-surface membrane. Progress in the utilization of proteomics for the identification of novel treatment targets has been significant. However, their use in tick-specific investigations is still quite novel, with the continual development of tick-specific methodologies essential. In this study, an innovative sample preparation method was utilized to isolate epithelial cells from tick midguts to identify the membrane-bound proteins. Proteomic analysis was conducted comparing crude and innovative sample preparation methods with 692 and 1242 tick-specific proteins, 108 and 314 surface proteins respectively, isolated from the midguts of semi-engorged Rhipicephalus microplus adult female ticks. This research reports a novel preparation protocol for the analysis of tick midgut proteins which reduces host protein contamination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare serum antibody levels, Leishmania infantum specific IFN-&#947; production and TLR2 and TLR4 transcripts in non-stimulated blood from dogs with different clinical stages at the time of diagnosis as well as blood parasitemia. Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISAs) were performed to determine serum antibody levels and IFN-&#947; production and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCRs) in order to determine blood parasite load and TLR2 and TLR4 transcripts. Older dogs were significantly affected by more severe disease with higher antibody levels and blood parasitemia than dogs with mild disease. IFN-&#947; production was significantly higher in dogs with stage I disease when compared to dogs with more severe disease. Relative quantification of TLR2 in dogs with mild disease was similar to that of control dogs. On the other hand, TLR2 transcripts were significantly higher in dogs with severe disease as compared with that from control healthy dogs. No differences were found in TLR4 relative quantification between groups. This study demonstrates that dogs with different clinical stages of leishmaniosis present different levels of biological markers indicative of different immune responses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Antigens involved in host cell invasion are vaccine targets for this disease but are largely unknown in this species. The invasion process of Babesia spp. into erythrocytes involves membrane proteins from the apical complex. A protein stored in the micronemes, called Micronemal Protein 1 (MIC-1), contains a sialic acid binding domain that participates in the invasion process of host cells and is a vaccine candidate in other apicomplexan parasites. It is not known if there is a homologous gene for mic-1 in B. bigemina. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the mic-1 gene homologue in Babesia bigemina. A gene was found with a microneme adhesive repeat (MAR) domain in the predicted amino acid sequence. Transcription was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, antibodies against peptides containing conserved B-cell epitopes were used to confirm the expression of MIC-1 in intraerythrocytic merozoites. The presence of anti MIC-1 antibodies in cattle naturally infected with B. bigemina was determined and up to 97.4% of the cattle sera (113 out of 116) identified MIC-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Finally, antibodies against MIC-1 were able to block 70% merozoite invasion in-vitro.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is known that cattle ticks can spend 80-90% of their lifecycle as questing larvae, yet the effect of climatic factors on their off-host behavior and survival is unclear. The goal of this study was to measure the effects of specific ecological factors on off-host questing larvae in nature. The study was conducted in a south Texas pasture over a two-year period, during which time larval populations were surveyed. Simultaneously, weather variables-precipitation, relative humidity, and ambient temperatures-were recorded. Larval survival rates varied among seasons, with the overall highest populations recorded in the spring and the lowest in the fall by a ratio of 20:1. In the winter, the larger numbers were collected from exposed habitats at a ratio of 6:1. Conversely, canopied habitats in the summer had 10-fold larger larval numbers. In the spring, exposed and canopied habitats showed no difference in tick larval survival rates. The results show that the interaction between season and habitat strongly influence off-host questing tick survival. Relative humidity was a key weather variable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Activity is thought to be linked to key active ingredients that include omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, a variety of carotenoids and other bioactive compounds. In this paper, we review the studies that have been undertaken in dogs, cats, and horses, and outline new research directions in shellfish breeding and high-value nutrition research programmes targeted at enhancing the efficacy of mussel and algal extracts. The addition of GSM to animal diets has alleviated feline degenerative joint disease and arthritis symptoms, and chronic orthopaedic pain in dogs. In horses, GSM extracts decreased the severity of lameness and joint pain and provided improved joint flexion in limbs with lameness attributed to osteoarthritis. Future research in this area should focus on elucidating the key active ingredients in order to link concentrations of these active ingredients with their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects. This would enable consistent and improved efficacy from GSM-based products for the purpose of improved animal health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The results demonstrated the absence of genetic rearrangements, high similarity and identity, and a close organizational link between the mitogenomes of N. amazoniensis and other argasids analyzed. In addition, the mitogenome had a monophyletic cladistic taxonomic arrangement, encompassed by representatives of the Afrotropical and Neotropical regions, with specific parasitism in bats, which may be indicative of an evolutionary process of cospeciation between vectors and the host.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Post mortem fluke counts are required to understand true efficacy. In this study, two praziquantel treatment regimens were evaluated using post mortem fluke counts: a high-dose treatment (HT) of 20 mg/kg body weight (BW) administered intramuscularly (IM) once a day for three consecutive days and a low-dose treatment (LT) of 5 mg/kg BW administered once (IM) and repeated 14 days later. A continual enrolment study design was used with 16 naturally infected cats randomly allocated in blocks of four to the HT (eight cats) or LT (eight cats) group. Treatment success, defined as absence of live flukes post mortem, was determined 10 days after the last treatment. Pre- and post-treatment fecal egg counts (centrifugation with Sheather's sugar flotation solution) and bile egg counts (obtained via percutaneous ultrasound guided cholecystocentesis) were evaluated as supportive efficacy data. Twelve cats completed the study with two cats withdrawn from each group. Neither treatment was 100% effective. In the HT group, three of six cats had live flukes, albeit low numbers, at post mortem, while all six LT group cats had live flukes. While fecal and bile egg counts were reduced in both group, they were not reflective of the true infection status of the cats post mortem.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in Brazil include Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I), Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV), Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV), Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Avian Reovirus (AReo), and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV). The aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven Brazilian states, corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017. This was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds, clinical signs, and geographical distribution, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques. Twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected. Single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples, and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. Both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems, stunting syndrome, decreases in egg and meat production, increased mortality, and respiratory signs. FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, and ARtV were mostly detected in young broilers, in contrast with IBV, which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age. These results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Like other zoonotic bacteria, NTS have the potential to act as reservoirs and vehicles for the transmission of antimicrobial drug resistance in different settings. Of particular concern is the resistance to critical "last resort" antimicrobials, such as carbapenems. In contrast to other Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter, which are major nosocomial pathogens affecting debilitated and immunocompromised patients), carbapenem resistance is still very rare in NTS. Nevertheless, it has already been detected in isolates recovered from humans, companion animals, livestock, wild animals, and food. Five carbapenemases with major clinical importance-namely KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) (class A), IMP (imipenemase), NDM (New Delhi metallo-&#946;-lactamase), VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-&#946;-lactamase) (class B), and OXA-48 (oxacillinase, class D)-have been reported in NTS. Carbapenem resistance due to the production of extended spectrum- or AmpC &#946;-lactamases combined with porin loss has also been detected in NTS. Horizontal gene transfer of carbapenemase-encoding genes (which are frequently located on self-transferable plasmids), together with co- and cross-selective adaptations, could have been involved in the development of carbapenem resistance by NTS. Once acquired by a zoonotic bacterium, resistance can be transmitted from humans to animals and from animals to humans through the food chain. Continuous surveillance of resistance to these "last resort" antibiotics is required to establish possible links between reservoirs and to limit the bidirectional transfer of the encoding genes between S. enterica and other commensal or pathogenic bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

C1A cysteine-proteinases (C1A-Cp) are papain-like enzymes implicated in pathogenic and vital steps of the parasite life cycle such as nutrition and host cell egress. An expansion of C1A-Cp of T. annulata and T. parva with respect to B. bovis and B. ovis was previously described. In the present work, C1A-Cp paralogs were identified in available genomes of species pertaining to each piroplasmid lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight C1A-Cp groups. The profile of C1A-Cp paralogs across these groups corroborates and defines the existence of six piroplasmid lineages. C. felis, T. equi and Theileria s.s. each showed characteristic expansions into extensive families of C1A-Cp paralogs in two of the eight groups. Underlying gene duplications have occurred as independent unique evolutionary events that allow distinguishing these three piroplasmid lineages. We hypothesize that C1A-Cp paralog families may be associated with the advent of the schizont stage. Differences in the invertebrate tick host specificity and/or mode of transmission in piroplasmid lineages might also be associated with the observed C1A-Cp paralog profiles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Trinidad and Tobago, one of the larger countries in the Caribbean, has an estimated annual foodborne disease burden of over 100,000 cases and, similar to other countries, the etiology of most of these cases is unknown. Both pathogens can reside as part of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of many wild and domestic animals, with animals acting as reservoirs, spillover hosts, or dead-end hosts. Carriage in animal species can be asymptomatic or, in the case of Salmonella in particular, there may be clinical manifestation in animals, which resemble the disease seen in humans. In this review, we will focus on the epidemiology of these two foodborne pathogens in Trinidad and Tobago and identify any knowledge gaps in the published literature. The filling of this critical knowledge void is essential for the development and implementation of appropriate mechanisms to reduce the dissemination and transmission of these pathogens, not only in Trinidad and Tobago, but also in the wider Caribbean.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We evaluated the effects of propofol on blood glucose metabolism and insulin secretion during an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in dogs. Blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured in dogs during IVGTT in a conscious state and under the effect of 2.0% isoflurane, low-concentration propofol (0.2 mg/kg/min), and high-concentration propofol (0.4 mg/kg/min) anesthesia. Plasma glucose levels significantly increased in all of the treatment groups when compared with those in the conscious group. The prolonged half-life period of plasma glucose suggested that isoflurane and propofol attenuated glucose metabolism in dogs. Plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in the isoflurane group when compared with those in the other groups, whereas blood FFA levels were increased in the propofol groups when compared with the other groups. These results suggest that propofol itself does not directly raise plasma glucose levels, but attenuates glucose metabolism by accumulating FFA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present work was conducted on 10 skulls and mandibles of the common opossum to describe the osteology and foramina of these skulls and mandibles grossly and radiographically. The information that is garnered can be used to detect, diagnose, and treat head affections, as well as for comparative studies with the skulls and mandibles of other similar species. The skulls and mandibles were prepared and cleaned using standard method. All of the characteristic features of various standards views of the skulls bones, including dorsal, lateral, caudal and midsagittal, and the lateral and caudal views of the mandibles as well as the foramina of the skulls and mandibles were described and discussed. Each skull was divided into long facial and short cranial regions. No supraorbital foramen was observed in the skulls. The tympanic bulla was absent while there was the tympanic process of the alisphenoid. The temporal process of the zygomatic bone, zygomatic process of maxilla, and zygomatic process of the squamosal bone formed the zygomatic arch. The dental formula was confirmed. The bones and foramina of the skull and mandible were similar to other marsupial species and were homologue to that of other mammals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Current methods of treating protothecal infections are ineffective, and no drug is licensed for use in cattle. The aim of the present study was to check the antialgal activity of 30 chemically defined essential oils (EOs) against Prototheca zopfii and Prototheca blaschkeae isolated from the milk of dairy cows with mastitis. A microdilution test was carried out to estimate the antialgal effectiveness of the selected chemically defined EOs. The microdilution test showed different degrees of inhibition among the examined Prototheca species. The activity of some of the examined EOs seem interesting. In particular, Citrus paradisi yielded the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration values (0.75%) for both algal species. P. zopfii appeared to be more sensitive to EOs in comparison to P. blaschkeae. The present study investigated the in vitro susceptibility of P. zopfii and P. blaschkeae to a wide range of EOs, obtained from different botanical families. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of EO-based formulations intended for the disinfection of both udder and milking products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the clinicopathological diversity of MGTs in Sri Lanka is largely unknown, impeding accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease. The present study investigated the clinicopathological features of MGTs in 74 dogs presented to two veterinary practices in Sri Lanka treated surgically, over a one-year period. Information regarding the patient signalment, clinical presentation, and reproductive history were collected, and each neoplasm was examined histologically. Forty-one (54.4%) dogs were primarily presented for mammary neoplasia, while a MGT was an incidental finding in 33 (44.6%) dogs. The majority of tumors were histologically malignant (n = 65, 87.8%), and 18 malignant tumor sub-types were identified. A significantly higher proportion of malignant tumors were large (&gt;3 cm diameter) and observed in inguinal mammary glands. Nulliparous (n = 42, 55.3%) dogs predominated in the group, and the mean age of MGT diagnosis was 8.0 &#177; 2.41 years. The present study identified tumor location and size to be predictive of malignancy. A high histological diversity of MGTs was observed. Overall, the present findings emphasize the necessity of improving awareness of MGTs among Sri Lankan clinicians as well as dog owners.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(2) Methods: Three different bait types were tested using a hand-out model on the campus of the Kasetsart University and the surrounding temples in Thailand during September 2017, consisting of two industrial manufactured baits (fish meal and egg-flavored) and one bait made from local material (boiled pig intestine placed in collagen casing). A PVC-capsule containing dyed water was inserted in the bait. (3) Results: The fishmeal bait was significantly less often accepted and consumed (50.29%) than the other two baits (intestine bait&amp;mdash;79.19%; egg bait&amp;mdash;78.77%). Delivery and release of the dyed water in the oral cavity was highest in the egg-flavored bait (84.50%), followed by the intestine bait (76.61%) and fishmeal (54.85%) baits. Bait acceptance was influenced by sex, age, and body size of the dog. Also, the origin of the dogs had a significant effect: temple dogs accepted the baits more often than street dogs. (4) Conclusion: A significant portion of the free-roaming dog population in this study can be vaccinated by offering vaccine baits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of the PNPLA1 gene variant in Golden Retrievers used for breeding and to provide more information to breeders in order to restrict the spread of this disease. Clinical examination and assessment of the PNPLA1 genotype using PCR testing of oral swabs were performed in 48 breeding Golden Retrievers. Wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous variants of the PNPLA1 gene were demonstrated in 10 (21%), 23 (48%), and 15 (31%) of the 48 dogs, respectively. In only 3 of the 48 dogs were clinical signs suggestive of ichthyosis identified. Data collected agreed with data reported in the literature. The high prevalence of homozygous and heterozygous variants makes the exclusion of mutated dogs from breeding impractical. Furthermore, the reliability of the PNPLA1 mutation in prediction of clinical signs of ichthyosis is unclear. Additional studies are needed to investigate if PNPLA1 is the only gene involved or if other genes and environmental factors have a role in the development of ichthyosis in Golden Retrievers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different vaccination programs using imported vaccines have failed to protect the flocks from field challenge. Recent studies confirmed a successful protection using homologous strains as live attenuated vaccines. In this study, a newly developed live attenuated IB-VAR2 vaccine representing the GI-23 Middle East IBV lineage was evaluated in day-old commercial broilers in an IBV-endemic area. A commercial broiler flock was vaccinated with the IB-VAR2 vaccine at day-old age followed by IB-H120 at day 16. The vaccinated flock was monitored on a weekly basis till the slaughter age. The health status and growth performance were monitored, and selected viral pathogen real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) detection was conducted on a weekly basis. Finally, the flock was compared to a nearby farm with only the classical IB-H120 vaccination program. Results showed that the IB-VAR2 vaccine was tolerable in day-old broiler chicks. The IBV virus rRT-PCR detection was limited to the trachea as compared to its nephropathogenic parent virus. Respiratory disease problems and high mortalities were reported in the IB-H120-only vaccinated flock. An exposure to a wild-type Egy/VarII strain was confirmed in both flocks as indicated by partial IBV S1 gene sequence. Even though the IB-VAR2-vaccinated flock performance was better than the flock that received only IB-H120, the IBV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and log2 Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody mean titers remained high (3128 &#177; 2713 and &#8805;9 log2, respectively) until the 28th day of age. The current study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of IB-VAR2 as a live attenuated vaccine in day-old commercial broilers. Also, the combination of IB-VAR2 and classical IBV vaccines confers a broader protective immune response against IBV in endemic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29747454</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serological Evidence for Influenza A Virus Exposure in Wild Birds in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</Title>	<Abstract>Migratory waterfowl and shorebirds are known to be important reservoirs for influenza A viruses (IAV) and they have been repeatedly implicated as causing avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks in domestic poultry flocks worldwide. In recent years, wild birds have been implicated in spreading zoonotic H5 influenza viruses to many countries, which has generated high levels of public health concern. Trinidad and Tobago (T&amp;T) is positioned along the wintering route of migratory birds from the Americas; every year, many species of wild birds stopover on the islands of T&amp;T, potentially carrying AIVs and exposing local populations of wild and domestic birds, including commercial poultry, to infection. The aim of this study was to trap, sample, and test as many wild bird species as possible to see whether they were actively infected or previously exposed to AIV. A total of 38 wild birds were trapped, sampled, and tested for IAV RNA, antibodies specific for influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) and antibodies that were specific for H5 and H7 subtypes. Five of the samples tested antibody positive for IAV, while three of these samples had positive titres (&#8805;16) for the H5 subtype, indicating that they were likely to have been previously infected with an H5 IAV subtype. One of the samples tested positive for IAV (M gene) RNA. These results highlight the potential threat that is posed by wild birds to backyard and commercial poultry in T&amp;T and emphasise the importance of maintaining high levels of biosecurity on poultry farms, ensuring that domestic and wild birds are not in direct or indirect contact. The results also underline the need to carry out routine surveillance for AIV in domestic and wild birds in T&amp;T and the wider Caribbean region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study set out to investigate possible infectious causes of reproductive problems by measuring the seroprevalence of four of the most significant reproductive pathogens in dairy cattle worldwide: Brucella abortus (B. abortus); Neospora caninum (N. caninum), Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV). These four reproductive pathogens have been suspected to be present in dairy cattle in T&amp;T for some time but, previously, studies have not been carried out to confirm their presence. Bulk milk samples were collected from 92 dairy farms across Trinidad, representing a total of 1177 dairy cattle. Four dairy farms were selected for individual milk sampling to assess in-farm seroprevalence levels. Milk samples were tested for antibodies to the four pathogens by commercial ELISA kits. The overall farm seroprevalence was 62% for N. caninium and 23% for IBRV, and no antibodies were detected in any of the bulk milk samples for B. abortus or BVDV. Mixed infections for IBRV and N. caninum were common. Seroprevalence levels were between 8% and 65% for N. caninum and between 3% and 53% IBRV on the four individual farms. These results reveal the presence of IBRV and N. caninum for the first time on the island of Trinidad and importantly reveal no evidence for the circulation of BVDV or B. abortus in dairy cattle in Trinidad.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Over 100 references were used, spanning over 100 years. The earliest being 1915 and the most recent being 2018. The references used in this review were synthesized to give a detailed look of the dentition, anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract and type of feed these animals consume. Nutritional requirements of the animals are required to understand what is needed for growth, maintenance and reproduction of each physiological stage. The agouti (D. leporina/D. aguti) was observed to be a monogastric mammal that fed primarily on fruits, seeds, animal matter and practiced caecotrophy. The lappe/paca (C. paca/A. paca) was described as a strict herbivore and a frugivore which practiced caecotrophy, with a diet that varied throughout the year, according to food availability. The capybara (H. hydrochaeris) was found to be the largest known rodent and was described as a semiaquatic hindgut fermenter that practiced caecotrophy. The manicou/opossum (D. marsupialis insularis) was found to be an omnivore with a simple stomach. The collared peccary (T. tajacu) was found to be frugivorous. Their unique stomach enabled them to consume a wide variety of feedstuff, allowing them to be found in a wide range of habitats. The red brocket deer (M. americana), a ruminant, was described as a browser that consumed mainly fruits and seeds and they frequented mineral lick. Knowledge of what they consume in the wild is important, so that we know what to feed in captivity. There is also the need to evaluate captive diets while trying to domesticate these mammals and develop nutrient requirement tables for these neo-tropical animals. Finally, an understanding of the dentition and gastrointestinal tract is important to increase efficiency (nutritional and cost). These six neo-tropical mammals were chosen due to their prevalence as game species in Trinidad and Tobago.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

When considering the potential monophyly of venomous Arachnida, this review reflects on the implications regarding the classification of ticks as venomous animals and the possible origin of toxins. The origin of tick toxins is compared with scorpion and spider toxins and venoms based on their significance, functionality, and structure in the search to find homologous venomous characters. Phenotypic evaluation of paralysis, as caused by different ticks, demonstrated the need for expansion on existing molecular data of pure isolated tick toxins because of differences and discrepancies in available data. The use of in-vivo, in-vitro, and in-silico assays for the purification and characterization of paralysis toxins were critically considered, in view of what may be considered to be a paralysis toxin. Purified toxins should exhibit physiologically relevant activity to distinguish them from other tick-derived proteins. A reductionist approach to identify defined tick proteins will remain as paramount in the search for defined anti-paralysis vaccines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although well-documented in human medicine, variation in clinical management is relatively unexplored in veterinary practice. Clinical vignette questionnaires were administered to a cross section of general practitioners (GPs) and veterinarians with postgraduate training in ophthalmology (PGs) to survey recommended management of canine prolapsed nictitans gland ("cherry eye", PNG) and feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) keratitis. The majority of veterinarians (96.2%) suggested surgical replacement of cherry eye, with a pocketing technique being the most frequently nominated procedure. GPs were more likely to suggest gland excision in the event of surgical failure, while PGs more frequently nominated techniques incorporating a periosteal anchor for salvage repair. Most respondents managed FHV-1 keratitis with topical antibiotics (76.4%), with a minority suggesting topical antivirals (32.2%). GPs favoured topical acyclovir whilst PGs more frequently recommended topical trifluorothymidine. A significantly larger proportion of PGs nominated systemic famciclovir and lysine supplement for FHV-1 keratitis. This survey revealed moderate treatment variation for these conditions, both between and within practitioner groups. Additional research is needed to assess the reasons for this variation, particularly for conditions in which high quality evidence is scant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, infection is rendered difficult to eradicate, causing chronic inflammatory reactions to the host and widespread prevalence. Although self-inactivating lentiviral vectors have been successfully tested in the clinic against virally-induced human infectious diseases, little is known about the transduction susceptibility of ruminant animal phagocytes that play a critical role in the outbreak of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis. In view of the development of a lentiviral vector-based platform targeting and inactivating specific genetic features of intracellular bacteria, we have tested the transducibility of ovine macrophages in terms of transgene expression and vector copy number (VCN). We show that ovine macrophages are relatively resistant to transduction even at a high multiplicity of infection with a conventional lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescence protein and that addition of transduction enhancers, such as polybrene, increases transgene expression even after a one-week culture of the transduced cells in vitro. Overall, we demonstrate that ovine macrophages may be efficiently expanded and transduced in culture, thus providing the benchmark for gene therapy applications for zoonotic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Computer assisted learning (CAL) programs are an increasingly common solution to these issues; however, research regarding the efficacy of high fidelity simulation is limited. The traditional first semester veterinary gross anatomy course curriculum at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (RUSVM) was supplemented with a web based virtual anatomy program, IVALA&amp;trade; (www.ivalalearn.com). The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between supplementary use of the IVALA&amp;trade; program and student examination scores, and to measure student perception surrounding IVALA&amp;trade;. IVALA&amp;trade; uses an interactive virtual canine specimen that enables students to identify, move, rotate, magnify, and remove individual anatomic structures while providing a text description of each selected anatomic point. Fifty-six first semester RUSVM students who supplemented their anatomic learning with the IVALA&amp;trade; program performed significantly higher on examinations compared to students (n = 123) that did not (p = 0.003). Students&#8217; overall perception toward IVALA&amp;trade; was enjoyable (mean = 3.8 out of a 5-point Likert scale) and beneficial to their knowledge of anatomy (mean = 3.7); however, students did not support replacing cadaveric dissection with CAL (mean = 2.1).

The direct fluorescent antibody (AB) test (FAT) is the gold standard for rabies diagnosis. Recently, additional tests besides the FAT have been developed, such as the direct rapid immunohistochemical test (DRIT). In this study, our objective was to further refine technical aspects of the DRIT using a combination of two monoclonal ABs (MABs), 502 and 802, conduct additional testing among rabies reference laboratories using a diversity of animal species and rabies virus (RV) variants and compare the potential utility of the DRIT for end users via proficiency testing (PT) against the FAT. Considering the ideal molar ratios of biotin to AB in formulation of the DRIT conjugate, 3.9 was found to be superior to 7.4, for detection of RV antigens in the brain of a naturally infected raccoon. Optimization of the DRIT conjugate may also be dependent upon the apparent choice of specific viral antigens for testing, as a gray fox RV variant reacted less strongly than a raccoon RV variant in determining the working dilution of the MAB cocktail. Using the same MABs and protocol, the DRIT was compared to the FAT using more than 800 samples of mammalian brains, representative of more than 25 taxa, including in excess of 250 animal rabies cases from Europe and North America. Sensitivity was determined at 98% (96[-]100%, 95% CI) and specificity was calculated at 95% (92[-]96%, 95% CI). In a comparison among end users, PT of laboratory personnel resulted in values of 77[-]100% sensitivity and 86-100% specificity. Based upon these and previously reported results, the DRIT appears to be a suitable alternative to the FAT for use in lyssavirus diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

If an attempt is made to raise the puppy, it is generally fed via an orogastric tube. Here, we describe the management of cleft palate in three puppies (two Boxers, one Collie) using a customised temporary prosthesis, which allowed the puppies to be bottle-fed and successfully raised by their owners (Cases 2 and 3) and the author (Case 1). The temporary palatal prosthesis was manufactured from a mouthguard intended for human children, which is made of thermoplastic silicone. The preparation procedure was simple and cost-effective. All puppies underwent corrective surgery at 5[-]6 months of age. After surgery, one of the Boxer puppies showed mandibular mesioclusion, while the other two showed no aberrations. All puppies gained the same amount of weight as their littermates, although the weight gain of the two Boxers was slower than that of their littermates. In summary, this case report describes an easy and effective way to raise puppies with cleft palate until corrective surgery can be performed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, the following mixtures were also tested: L. cubeba and C. citratus (M1), L. cubeba and A. triphylla (M2), A. triphylla and C. citratus (M3), A. triphylla, C.citratus and L. cubeba (M4), S. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum (M5). One hundred and ninety-one compounds were identified in the tested EOs and mixtures. MIC determination found good anti-E. coli activity with C. zeylanicum (2.52 mg/mL), C. citratus (1.118 mg/mL), L. cubeba (1.106 mg/mL), M. piperita (1.14 mg/mL) and S. aromaticum (1.318 mg/mL) EOs. Among the mixtures, M5 showed the best result with a MIC value of 2.578 mg/mL. The best antimycotic activity was showed by A. triphylla (0.855 mg/mL), followed by C. citratus (0.895 mg/mL), while C. aurantium, M. piperita, B. sacra and P. graveolens did not yield any antifungal effect at the highest dilution. The mixtures exhibited no antifungal activity at all. This study shows promising results in order to use EOs in the environment for disinfection purposes in poultry farms and/or in hatcheries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The correct diagnosis and management of AFR relies upon clinical nutrition. The reliability of commercial hypoallergenic diets commonly used in AFR has been questioned because studies have shown the presence of proteins not declared on the label ingredients. It is proposed that extensively hydrolysed protein-based diets constitute a reliable nutritional solution. Royal Canin Anallergenic&amp;trade; Canine and Feline diets are formulated with very low molecular weight feather protein and purified corn starch. Protein gel electrophoresis and thin layer paper chromatography were used to characterize protein hydrolysis in these diets and their hydrolysed raw materials; protein species were identified by mass spectrometry. To detect cross-contaminating protein, species-specific DNA was measured and correlated with ancillary protein content using calibration curves. The only protein components detected in the extensively hydrolysed feather protein raw material were amino acids and small oligopeptides. GBSS-I (Granule-bound starch synthase 1) was detected in the finished diets; this has not been reported as a clinically apparent allergen in dogs or cats. The DNA threshold corresponding to the maximum acceptable level of ancillary protein was not exceeded in 99.9% of more than 2150 product batches tested and no products were released to the market with cross-contaminating proteins. These results demonstrate the extensive level of protein hydrolysis in Royal Canin Anallergenic&amp;trade; Canine and Feline diets and the absence of cross-contaminating protein, both key requirements for a diet to be used during diagnosis and for management of pets with AFR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The doe developed a grade 6/6 holosystolic murmur during hospitalisation. Echocardiography revealed vegetative growths attached to cusps of the mitral and aortic valves. There was an accelerated aortic flow at 2.9 m/s and aortic insufficiency. The aortic vegetation was prolapsing into the left ventricle during diastole, causing it to contact the septal mitral valve leaflet. A diagnosis of mitral and aortic vegetative endocarditis, with a mitral kissing vegetation and mild aortic stenosis, was reached. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antimicrobials. A short-term follow-up showed no resolution of clinical signs, and the animal eventually died. Post-mortem examination showed severe vegetative, fibrino-necrotic, aortic and mitral valve lesions. The goat also had a severe fibrino-suppurative mastitis. Histopathology confirmed the lesions to be vegetative endocarditis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30002309</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Ranking of Production Animal Welfare and Ethics Issues in Australia and New Zealand by Veterinary Students.</Title>	<Abstract>The importance of animal welfare and ethics (AWE) within the veterinary education should reflect community concerns and expectations about AWE, and the professional demands of veterinary accreditation on the first day of practice (or 'Day One' competences). Currently, much interest and debate surrounds the treatment of production animals, particularly around live export. To explore the attitudes to AWE of veterinary students in Australia and New Zealand, a survey was undertaken to (i) understand what students consider important AWE topics for initial production animal competence; and (ii) ascertain how these priorities correlated with gender, area of intended practice and stage-of-study. The results from 575 veterinary students showed that all students ranked strategies to address painful husbandry procedures as the most important issues on their first day in production animal practice. Additionally, it was found that the importance students assigned to an understanding of human[-]animal interactions declined as they progressed through the veterinary course. In contrast, the importance of an understanding of euthanasia issues for production animals increased for male students as they progressed through the course, and remained consistently high in females. Females also gave higher ranking to the importance of understanding production animal stress associated with transport, and ranked strategies to address painful husbandry procedures more important than did males. These findings should help the development of AWE teaching resources that address students' attitudes and competence and that can be delivered when students are most receptive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hence, veterinary schools have an opportunity to raise animal health and welfare standards by improving veterinary students' animal welfare and ethics (AWE) education, including that related to animals used for scientific purposes. A survey of 851 students in the early, mid, and senior stages of their courses at all eight veterinary schools across Australia and New Zealand was undertaken on their first day of practice (or Day One Competences) to explore how veterinary students viewed the importance of their competence in the management of welfare and ethical decision-making relating to animals kept for scientific purposes. From highest to lowest, the rankings they assigned were: Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) Procedures or Requirements; 3Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction); Humane Endpoints; Euthanasia; "What Is a Research Animal?"; and Conscientious Objections. Female students rated Conscientious Objections, Humane Endpoints, and Euthanasia significantly higher than male students did across the three stages of study. The score patterns for these three variates showed a trend for the male students to be more likely to score these topics as extremely important as they advanced through the course, but female students' scores tended to decline slightly or stay relatively stable. No gender differences emerged for the three variates: 3Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction); AEC Procedures or Requirements; and "What Is a Research Animal?". This study demonstrates that understandings of the regulatory and normative frameworks are considered most important in animal welfare and ethics competence in veterinary students. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate what importance veterinary students place on their competence regarding animals kept for scientific purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this regard, a global program has been initiated for the elimination of human rabies caused by rabid dogs through the mass vaccination of canine populations. Geographic areas vary greatly towards attainment of this objective. For example, while dog-mediated and wildlife rabies have been largely controlled in major parts of the Americas and Western Europe, the Middle East still grapples with human rabies transmitted by unvaccinated dogs and cats. Rabies prevention and control in the Middle East is quite difficult because the region is transcontinental, encompassing portions of Africa, Asia, and Europe, while consisting of politically, culturally, and economically diverse countries that are often subject to war and unrest. Consequently, one over-riding dilemma is the misinformation or complete lack of rabies surveillance data from this area. This communication is an attempt to provide an overview of rabies in the Middle East, as a cohesive approach for the honing of disease management in each area, based on data compiled from multiple sources. In addition, the related regional transboundary movement of rabies was investigated through phylogenetic studies of available viral gene sequences. Thereafter, the epidemiological status of rabies was assessed for the region. Finally, localities were classified first by the Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination framework and then categorized into four different groups based on management theme: "rabies free"; owned dog and domestic animal vaccination; community dog vaccination; and wildlife vaccination. The classification system proposed herein may serve as a baseline for future efforts. This is especially important due to the severe lack of rabies information available for the Middle East as a whole and a need for a comprehensive program focusing on the entirety of the region in light of renewed international commitment towards canine rabies elimination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These viral infections mainly affect young chickens, causing apathy, depression, ruffled feathers, cloacal pasting, and diarrhea. Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV) is such an infection and has been detected in chickens showing signs of enteric diseases worldwide. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a sensitive real-time fast-qPCR assay based on SYBR[&#174;] Green for detection and quantification of ChPV. A 561-bp non-structural (NS) gene was amplified and cloned, and a pair of primers was designed based on conserved nucleotide sequences on the NS gene of ChPV, the intercalating DNA reagent SYBR[&#174;] Green was employed, and the Fast mode of a thermocycler was used. The assay detects 10[8] to 10[1] copies of the genome (CG). The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated to five CG, and the limit of quantification (LoQ) was estimated at ten CG. The standard curve efficiency was 101.94%, and the melting curve showed a unique clean peak and a melting temperature of 79.3 &#176;C. The assay was specific to amplify the ChPV NS gene, and no amplification was shown from other viral genomes or in the negative controls. A total of 141 samples were tested using the assay, of which 139 samples were found positive. The highest CG value of ChPV was 5.7 &#215; 10[6] CG/uL of DNA without apparent clinical signs of enteric disturbance, and 4.6 &#215; 10[6] CG/uL DNA were detected in chickens with RSS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-six canine mammary carcinoma patients received injections of canine interferon-&#946; (cIFN-&#946;) and HSV-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) carrying lipoplexes, into the tumor bed, immediately after surgery. Next, they started periodic subcutaneous injections of lipoplexes carrying a human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-2 mixed with allogeneic mammary carcinoma extracts. This combined strategy was safe and well tolerated. In addition, only two out of 26 patients treated with complete surgery developed a local relapse, and 0 out of 29 stage II and III patients displayed distant metastases, suggesting both local and systemic antitumor activities. The most encouraging result was the long survival times: 22 &gt; 1 year (where 13 &gt; 2 and 4 &gt; 3 years), while maintaining a good quality of life. The preliminary results in five patients presenting with local disease, an additional HSV-tk/GCV plus cIFN-&#946; gene treatment induced local antitumor activity, evidenced by four objective responses (one complete, three partial) and one stable disease. This successful outcome supports further studies to validate this approach not only for canine veterinary patients, but also for translation to human patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human OSCC, cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) contributes to inflammation and tumor invasiveness. CD147 is a potential therapeutic target, but the expression of CD147 in feline OSCC has not been examined. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine if cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and CD147 expression in feline OSCC biopsies was coordinated. Tumor cells were more likely to express COX-2 (22/43 cases or 51%) compared to stroma (8/43 or 19%) and adjacent oral epithelium (9/31 cases or 29%) (p &lt; 0.05). CD147 was also more likely to occur in tumor cells compared to stroma and adjacent mucosa, with 21/43 (49%) of cases having &gt;50% tumor cells with mild or moderate CD147 expression, compared to 9/28 (32%) in adjacent epithelium and only 5/43 (12%) in adjacent stroma (p &lt; 0.05). In feline OSCC cell lines (SCCF1, SCCF2, and SCCF3), CD147 gene expression was more consistently expressed compared to COX-2, which was 60-fold higher in SCCF2 cells compared to SCCF1 cells (p &lt; 0.05). CD147 expression did not correlate with COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion, indicating that they may be independently regulated. CD147 potentially represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of feline OSCC and further study of CD147 is warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clinical appearance, history, histopathology, and response to therapy were suggestive of a rare vasculopathy of the nasal planum that has been previously described in Scottish Terrier dogs. In previously published reports, medical treatments of the disease had failed, leading to euthanasia of five dogs, while a short-term follow-up was available for one case that was controlled with prednisolone and ciclosporin. The dog reported herein was successfully treated with medical therapy consisting initially of a combination of ciclosporin and prednisolone and endonasal stents applied over the first six months. Stents were inserted in order to prevent abnormal scarring and nostril stenosis. More than one and a half years after diagnosis, the dog is still being administered ciclosporin once daily, breathes normally, and has an optimal quality of life.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The major tool of control is reducing the number of ticks, applying acaricides in cattle. However, overuse has led to selection of resistant populations of R. microplus to most of these products, some even to more than one active principle. Thus, exploration for new molecules with acaricidal activity in R. microplus has become necessary. Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is an essential enzyme in R. microplus metabolism and could be an interesting target for the development of new methods for tick control. In this work, we screened 227 compounds, from our in-house chemo-library, against TIM from R. microplus. Four compounds (50, 98, 14, and 161) selectively inhibited this enzyme with IC50 values between 25 and 50 &#956;M. They were also able to diminish cellular viability of BME26 embryonic cells by more than 50% at 50 &#956;M. A molecular docking study showed that the compounds bind in different regions of the protein; compound 14 interacts with the dimer interface. Furthermore, compound 14 affected the survival of partially engorged females, fed artificially, using the capillary technique. This molecule is simple, easy to produce, and important biological data-including toxicological information-are available for it. Our results imply a promising role for compound 14 as a prototype for development of a new acaricidal involving selective TIM inhibition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Various surgical interventions have been described, but effective technique is currently considered to be a matter of personal clinician preference. The aim of this rapid review was to evaluate existing peer-reviewed evidence of effectiveness for surgical techniques and their subsequent effects on quantitative and clinical lacrimal outcomes for PNG. We performed a structured bibliographic search of CAB Abstracts, PubMed, and Medline using terms relevant to dogs, nictitans gland, and surgery on 13 September 2017. Included studies were assessed for study design, reporting characteristics, surgical techniques, and surgical and lacrimal outcomes. Fifteen of three hundred fifteen identified studies were eligible for inclusion. Seven different replacement techniques were identified, along with gland excision. All studies were observational or descriptive, with the exception of a single crossover trial. Outcomes reporting was heterogeneous and provided limited detail on lacrimal outcomes or on breed propensity for recurrence. Insufficient data precluded comparison of techniques for either surgical failure rates or lacrimal outcomes, although proportional meta-analysis yielded an overall failure rate of 3% (95% CI 1[-]7%) for the Morgan's pocket procedure. Improved reporting of veterinary surgical studies will improve evidence appraisal and synthesis, as well as reduce potential sources of bias.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In addition to the protein-coding region, each segment possesses 5' and 3' non-coding regions (NCR) that are important for transcription, replication and packaging. The NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the impacts of variability in the NCRs are not completely understood. Full NCRs have been determined from some viruses, but a detailed analysis of potential variability in these regions among viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To evaluate the degree of conservation in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls and seabirds). We then extended our study to include NCRs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Virus Database, which allowed us to analyze a wider variety of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within the NCRs varies among segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA and the least in the M and NS segments. Overall, variability in NCR sequences was correlated with the coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical coevolution of the (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For comparison, untreated and treated (0.1% thiabendazole, 0.1% TBZ) controls were used. Six repetitions were made throughout the experiment. Data were statistically elaborated using the &#967;[2] test. The concentration able to inhibit the development of the 50% of L1s to L3s and causing the mortality of the 50% of L3s (EC50) was also calculated. L3s recovered from untreated Petri dishes were identified at the genus level. In EHT, all tested compounds at all concentrations significantly (p &lt; 0.01) inhibited the hatch of the eggs when compared to the untreated controls, but none of them was as effective as 0.1% TBZ. In LDT, rutin (at 1%, 0.75% and 0.5%), mangiferin (at 0.25% and 0.125%), &#946;-sitosterol (at 1%) and 0.1% TBZ completely prevented the larval development from L1 to L3 in respect to the untreated controls (p &lt; 0.01). In LMT, all tested compounds significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased the death of L3s compared to the untreated controls, except for &#946;-sitosterol at 0.5%. However, only rutin at all concentrations and 0.25% and 0.125% mangiferin were as effective as 0.1% TBZ.

However, dog population sizes are generally unknown in most rabies-endemic areas. Several approaches have been used to estimate dog populations but without rigorous evaluation. We compare post-vaccination transects, household surveys, and school-based surveys to determine which most precisely estimates dog population sizes. These methods were implemented across 28 districts in southeast Tanzania, in conjunction with mass dog vaccinations, covering a range of settings, livelihoods, and religious backgrounds. Transects were the most precise method, revealing highly variable patterns of dog ownership, with human/dog ratios ranging from 12.4:1 to 181.3:1 across districts. Both household and school-based surveys generated imprecise and, sometimes, inaccurate estimates, due to small sample sizes in relation to the heterogeneity in patterns of dog ownership. Transect data were subsequently used to develop a predictive model for estimating dog populations in districts lacking transect data. We predicted a dog population of 2,316,000 (95% CI 1,573,000[-]3,122,000) in Tanzania and an average human/dog ratio of 20.7:1. Our modelling approach has the potential to be applied to predicting dog population sizes in other areas where mass dog vaccinations are planned, given census and livelihood data. Furthermore, we recommend post-vaccination transects as a rapid and effective method to refine dog population estimates across large geographic areas and to guide dog vaccination programmes in settings with mostly free roaming dog populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>30213060</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Chemical Characterization of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. Hydroalcoholic Extract and Its Efficiency against Gastrointestinal Nematodes of Sheep.</Title>	<Abstract>Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. is a xerophylous plant that originated in tropical and subtropical America. This plant is popularly known in Brazil as "palma forrageira" (cactus pear) and plays a fundamental role in animal nutrition, mainly in the Northeastern semi-arid region of the country. The plant has several uses since it presents bioactive compounds that confer biological and pharmacological properties. In this context, the cactus pear can also be considered a potential product to combat parasite infections. The objective of this study was to chemically characterize the O. ficus-indica hydroalcoholic extract (OFIEOH) and to determine its efficacy against gastrointestinal parasites using in vitro tests. Initially, the hydroalcoholic extract from cladode peels of O. ficus-indica was produced by maceration for 21 days. For the chemical characterization, colorimetric dosages were performed for carbohydrates, proteins, phenols and condensed tannins. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry/electron spray ionization (LC-MS/ESI) was used to characterize the polyphenolic profile of the OFIEOH extract. Fifteen compounds were identified in the OFIEOH extract, such as methyl, glycosylated and aglycone quercetin derivatives and aglycone and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives. Tri-glycosylated methyl quercetin derivatives were the main compounds identified. In vitro egg hatch (EHT) and larval migration tests (LMT) were used in a range of concentrations of OFIEOH from 12.5 to 100 mg/mL for EHT and 12.5 to 200 mg/mL for LMT. In addition, the LMT was used to test ivermectin (IVM) (from 11.4 to 57.1 &#181;M), associated with the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) for OFIEOH. The combination of OFIEOH (12.5 to 200 mg/mL) plus the IC50 of IVM was also tested. The efficacy of OFIEOH alone varied from 19.33 to 90.0% using the EHT. The LMT revealed an efficacy of 5.78 to 77.26% for the extract. Both tests showed a concentration-dependence inhibitory effect. We found a drug-extract antagonistic neutralizing effect when doses of IVM were added to OFIEOH (maximum efficacy of 73.78%), while a positive additive effect was observed when OFIEOH was added to the IC50 of IVM (IC50 of 82.79 for OFIEOH alone against an IC50 of 55.08 of OFIEOH + IVM). The data from this work indicate that OFIEOH alone may be considered as a suitable ecofriendly product to control gastrointestinal parasites of sheep, offering a more holistic approach to improve animal farming and welfare. The drug-extract interaction is also a promising therapeutic alternative, reducing the final dose to the host, with an optimum combination effect.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These interests are often different and sometimes conflicting. As a result, different management perspectives and aims have been implemented (One Health, public health, veterinary public health, maintenance of a brucellosis free status in livestock, sustainable wildlife harvesting by hunters, wildlife and environmental health). When addressing Brucella infection in wildlife, the most important features of Brucella infection should be considered and the following questions need to be answered: (1) Is Brucella infection a result of a spillover from livestock or is it a sustainable infection in one or more wildlife host species? (2) Did the epidemiological situation of Brucella infection in wildlife change over time and, if so, what are the main drivers of change and does it impact the wildlife population dynamics? (3) Does Brucella infection in wildlife represent a reservoir of Brucella strains for livestock? (4) Is Brucella infection in wildlife of zoonotic concern? These questions point to the fundamental biological question of how animal (domestic and wildlife)/Brucella spp. partnerships are established. Will we be able to decipher an evolutionary trajectory through a livestock-to-wildlife "host jump"? Whole genome sequencing and new "omics" techniques will help in deciphering the molecular basis of Brucella host preference and open new avenues in brucellosis management aimed at preventing opportunities for Brucella host jumps.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30248906</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Multifaceted Zoonotic Risk of H9N2 Avian Influenza.</Title>	<Abstract>Poultry-adapted H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are commonly found in many countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, and although classified as low pathogenic viruses, they are an economically important disease. Besides the importance of the disease in the poultry industry, some H9N2 AIVs are also known to be zoonotic. The disease in humans appears to cause primarily a mild upper respiratory disease, and doesn't cause or only rarely causes the severe pneumonia often seen with other zoonotic AIVs like H5N1 or H7N9. Serologic studies in humans, particularly in occupationally exposed workers, show a large number of people with antibodies to H9N2, suggesting infection is commonly occurring. Of the four defined H9N2 poultry lineages, only two lineages, the G1 and the Y280 lineages, are associated with human infections. Almost all of the viruses from humans have a leucine at position 226 (H3 numbering) of the hemagglutinin associated with a higher affinity of binding with &#945;2,6 sialic acid, the host cell receptor most commonly found on glycoproteins in the human upper respiratory tract. For unknown reasons there has also been a shift in recent years of poultry viruses in the G1 and Y280 lineages to also having leucine instead of glutamine, the amino acid found in most avian viruses, at position 226. The G1 and Y280 poultry lineages because of their known ability to infect humans, the high prevalence of the virus in poultry in endemic countries, the lack of antibody in most humans, and the shift of poultry viruses to more human-like receptor binding makes these viruses a human pandemic threat. Increased efforts for control of the virus, including through effective vaccine use in poultry, is warranted for both poultry and public health goals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30248931</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Dogs (Canis familiaris) as Sentinels for Human Infectious Disease and Application to Canadian Populations: A Systematic Review.</Title>	<Abstract>In a world where climate change, vector expansion, human activity, and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries, the human[-]animal[-]pathogen interface has become less defined. Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25% from North America, and 11% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30274233</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A Cross-Sectional Study of Experiences and Attitudes towards Clinical Audit of Farm Animal Veterinary Surgeons in the United Kingdom.</Title>	<Abstract>Clinical audit is a quality improvement tool used to assess and improve the clinical services provided to patients. This is the first study to investigate the extent to which clinical audit is understood and utilised in farm animal veterinary practice. A cross-sectional study to collect experiences and attitudes of farm animal veterinary surgeons in the UK towards clinical audit was conducted using an online nationwide survey. The survey revealed that whilst just under three-quarters (n = 237/325; 73%) of responding veterinary surgeons had heard of clinical audit, nearly 50% (n = 148/301) had never been involved in a clinical audit of any species. The participants' knowledge of what a clinical audit was varied substantially, with many respondents reporting not receiving training on clinical audit at the undergraduate or postgraduate level. Respondents that had participated in a clinical audit suggested that protected time away from clinical work was required for the process to be completed successfully. This novel study suggests that clinical audit is undertaken to some extent in farm animal practice and that practitioner perception is that it can bring benefits, but was felt that more resources and support were needed for it to be implemented successfully on a wider scale.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since standard serological tests can determine false positive results, the development of alternative tests with improved sensitivity and specificity is rather essential. We analyzed 1212 sera collected at slaughterhouse from healthy pigs belonging to 62 farms of North-Central Italy. Sera were tested by Rose Bengal Test, Complement Fixation Test, and subsequently by a Dot Blot (DB) and Western Blot assays (WB). Only one serum resulted positive to all tests, indicating that swine brucellosis has a very limited spread. DB and WB could represent a support to the available serological tests; however, further studies to validate these tests are needed. In the presence of reemerging diseases, a prompt and continuous monitoring design is necessary to acquire epidemiological information for the subsequent application of specific health emergency plans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Inducing a patient's own immune system to have an anti-tumor response is an attractive approach to cancer therapy. In this safety study, autologous tumor vaccines produced specifically for each canine patient were combined with Advax&#8482;, a novel non-inflammatory immunomodulator and vaccine adjuvant and were tested for safety in a diverse range of patient presentations alone or in combination with other treatments. Canine patients had their tumor biopsied, debulked or resected and the tumor antigens were processed into an autologous vaccine formulated with Advax&#8482; adjuvant with or without rhizavidin as an additional immune stimulant. Patients treated early in the trial received two intramuscular (IM) doses, 2 weeks apart. As the study progressed and no issues of safety were observed, the protocol was changed to weekly vaccinations for 4 weeks followed by monthly booster shots. Over the 150 I.M injections delivered to date, the vaccine was found to be very safe and no significant adverse reactions were observed. These results justify ongoing development and future controlled studies of this autologous vaccine approach.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Naturally-acquired E. coli O157:H7 infections occur in numerous species but, particularly, cattle have been identified as a significant reservoir for human cases. E. coli O157:H7 are isolated from a number of domestic and wild animals, including rodents that share a living space with cattle. These Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 strains can be highly virulent in humans, but little is known about the sequelae of interspecies transfer. In a group of neonatal calves, we determined the differences in colonization patterns and lesions associated with infection using either a wildlife or bovine E. coli O157:H7 strain. In calves challenged with the wildlife E. coli O157:H7 strain, the large (descending) colon was solely colonized, which differed substantially from the calves inoculated with the bovine E. coli O157:H7 strain, where the spiral colon was the principal target of infection. This study also demonstrated that while both interspecies- and intraspecies-derived E. coli O157:H7 can infect young calves, the distribution and severity differs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Faecal samples were collected from sheep with naturally occurring infection of GIN (Trichostrongylus spp., Chabertia ovina, Cooperia spp., Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia spp.). Crude leaf extracts of H. forskaolii was obtained using increasing polarity solvents: n-hexane, chloroform, chloroform:methanol 9:1, methanol. Thiabendazole (0.2 &#181;g/mL and 0.5 &#181;g/mL) was used as a positive control and untreated GIN eggs in deionised water served as the negative control. All the extracts exhibited a weak ovicidal activity against GIN (less than 50% of egg hatch). Noteworthy, the n-hexane extract showed a percentage of inhibition of egg hatching greater than other extracts inhibiting the 30.8% at the concentration of 1 mg/mL showing a dose-dependent effect on nematode eggs hatching. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of extracts used and to evaluate the ovicidal effects of other extracts of H. forskaolii.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30336578</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Peer Feedback on Collaborative Learning Activities in Veterinary Education.</Title>	<Abstract>Collaborative learning activities are an increasingly prominent feature of veterinary curricula that have been redesigned to achieve competency-based graduate learning outcomes. This evolution challenges the traditional individualistic approach to veterinary education and necessitates revisions to assessment and feedback practices to ensure constructive alignment. Peer feedback has been widely reported in the medical education literature as a teaching intervention in collaborative learning settings, with learning gains reported for students who receive and provide peer feedback. In this setting, peer feedback has been demonstrated to provide valuable formative feedback on professional behaviors and skills. However, there are very few such reports in the veterinary education literature to date. Barriers to the introduction of this approach can include teacher and student perceptions, and concerns around validity and reliability. This review aimed to provide an overview of current evidence regarding peer feedback on collaborative learning activities in higher education, and to explore opportunities and challenges for the introduction of peer feedback in the context of veterinary education. We contend that early and repeated provision of formative peer feedback can provide an opportunity to scaffold the development of crucial core competencies within veterinary education, including the self-regulated learning skills required to work in collaborative teams, and interpret and act on feedback.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the outcome and complications of UG-RHA in dogs with PHPTH. The medical records of dogs with PHPTH submitted to UG-RHA between June 2012 and September 2015 in a French referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Eight cases were included. No sex predisposition was found. The median age at diagnosis was 12 years. The most common clinical sign was polyuria/polydipsia. All of the dogs were hypercalcaemic prior to UG-RHA, and all showed a parathyroid nodule identified upon cervical ultrasound. UG-RHA was uneventful, allowing a successful resolution of hypercalcemia in all dogs (8/8). Six out of eight dogs did not receive vitamin D supplementation either pre- or post-procedure. From these, three dogs developed biochemical hypocalcemia, but only one required therapy. Other short-term complications included Horner's syndrome (1/8) and aspiration bronchopneumonia, which led to cardio-respiratory arrest in one large-breed dog (1/8). Long-term complications were scarce, with no recurrence reported in all of the cases that were assessed in follow-up (4/7). This study demonstrates that UG-RHA has few short or long-term complications, and it is a good therapeutic alternative for dogs with PHPTH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30380736</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Challenges and Opportunities Developing Mathematical Models of Shared Pathogens of Domestic and Wild Animals.</Title>	<Abstract>Diseases that affect both wild and domestic animals can be particularly difficult to prevent, predict, mitigate, and control. Such multi-host diseases can have devastating economic impacts on domestic animal producers and can present significant challenges to wildlife populations, particularly for populations of conservation concern. Few mathematical models exist that capture the complexities of these multi-host pathogens, yet the development of such models would allow us to estimate and compare the potential effectiveness of management actions for mitigating or suppressing disease in wildlife and/or livestock host populations. We conducted a workshop in March 2014 to identify the challenges associated with developing models of pathogen transmission across the wildlife-livestock interface. The development of mathematical models of pathogen transmission at this interface is hampered by the difficulties associated with describing the host-pathogen systems, including: (1) the identity of wildlife hosts, their distributions, and movement patterns; (2) the pathogen transmission pathways between wildlife and domestic animals; (3) the effects of the disease and concomitant mitigation efforts on wild and domestic animal populations; and (4) barriers to communication between sectors. To promote the development of mathematical models of transmission at this interface, we recommend further integration of modern quantitative techniques and improvement of communication among wildlife biologists, mathematical modelers, veterinary medicine professionals, producers, and other stakeholders concerned with the consequences of pathogen transmission at this important, yet poorly understood, interface.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Methods to control STEC in livestock and humans are limited. These and other emerging pathogens are a global concern and novel mitigation strategies are required. Habitats populated by bacteria are subjected to competition pressures due to limited space and resources but they use various strategies to compete in natural environments. Our objective was to evaluate non-pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from cattle feces for their ability to out-compete STEC. Competitive fitness of non-pathogenic E. coli against STEC were assessed in competitions using liquid, agar, and nutrient limiting assays. Winners were determined by enumeration using O-serogroup specific quantitative PCR or a semi-quantitative grading. Initial liquid competitions identified two strong non-pathogenic competitors (O103F and O26E) capable of eliminating various STEC including O157 and O111. The strain O103F was dominant across permeable physical barriers for all tested E. coli and STEC strains indicating the diffusion of antimicrobial molecules. In direct contact and even with temporal disadvantages, O103F out-competed STEC O157E. The results suggest that O103F or the diffusible molecule(s) it produces have a potential to be used as an alternative STEC mitigation strategy, either in medicine or the food industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East are the main transmission regions of Schistosoma mansoni. The fight against transmission through the use of molluscicides is not recent and has been advocated as the only activity with the possibility of interruption of transmission in small, epidemiologically active outbreaks. Euphorbia milii var. hislopii (syn. splendens) (Des Moulins, 1826) is the most promising for use in official schistosomiasis control programs according to the WHO. In this review, we show that an understanding of some how E. milii latex affects the snail vector and their parasites from a molecular level to field conditions is lacking. On the other hand, this type of treatment could also provide a rationale for the control of schistosomiasis and other parasitosis. Several publications contribute to enforcing the use of E. milii latex in endemic countries as a cheap alternative or complement to mass drug treatment with praziquantel, the only available drug to cure the patients (without preventing re-infection).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This quantitative study examined the mediating role of communication on the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty (attitudinal and behavioral) in veterinary clinics, along with the moderating roles of trust, commitment, perceived value, and relational characteristics. Responses collected from 351 pet-owners through social media were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that attitudinal loyalty (AL) has a strong positive relationship with communication at multiple points in a veterinary clinic, whereas the relationship with behavioral loyalty (BL) was not as clear. Additional findings suggest that AL, which is influenced by trust in the veterinarian, communication from staff members and commitment, has a strong positive relationship with behavioral intentions, increases the number of products and services that a pet-owner consumes at his or her primary veterinary clinic, and attenuates the role of cost in receiving veterinary care. These findings can help veterinary clinic owners and managers in developing and implementing relationship strategies that improve pet-owner loyalty.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tumors of the bladder, urethra, and prostate often occur independently, although extension of these tumors into adjacent regions of the lower urinary tract is documented frequently. The most common lower urinary tract tumor in dogs and cats is transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). In both dogs and cats, TCC affecting the urinary bladder is generally considered to be highly aggressive with both local and metastatic disease potential, and this disease poses unique treatment challenges. Whereas much literature exists regarding the TCC disease process, treatment options, and prognosis in dogs, relatively few studies on feline TCC have been published due to the lower incidence of TCC in this species. Prostate tumors, most commonly adenocarcinomas, occur less commonly in dogs and cats but serve an important role as a comparative model for prostate neoplasia in humans. This article serves as a review of the current information regarding canine and feline lower urinary tract neoplasia as well as the relevance of these diseases with respect to their human counterparts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Initially, it was used as a terminal cross and currently it represents approximately 4.45% of all the Brazilian zebu cattle. Studies were conducted to estimate genetic parameters in the Indubrasil using pedigree information, however, until now, no study has been developed using large-scale genomic markers in this breed. Pedigree information are widely used to investigate population parameters; however, they can neglect some estimates when compared to the use of genomic markers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the population structure and the genetic diversity of Indubrasil cattle using a high-density Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) panel (Illumina BovineHD BeadChip 700k). Levels of genomic homozygosity were evaluated using three different approaches: Runs of homozygosity (FROH), % of homozygosis (FSNP), and inbreeding coefficient (Fx). Further, Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) segments conserved among the animals were investigated to identify possible regions associated with the breed characteristics. Our results indicate that even the Indubrasil breed having a small effective population size, the levels of homozygosity (FROH = 0.046) are still small. This was possibly caused by the cross conducted among different breeds for its development. It suggests no immediate risks associated with loss of genetic variation. This information might be used in breeding programs, for the breed conservation and for the expansion of the Indubrasil breed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although much client communication occurs face-to-face, telephone communication is used to provide patient updates, relay results of diagnostic tests, and check on discharged patients. This research explored fourth year veterinary medical students' telephone communication skills. We recorded and analyzed the transcripts of 25 calls students made to clients of three different services in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Additionally, we explored the perspectives of veterinary educators by distributing a survey to university faculty and house officers (n = 57). Results indicate that students excelled at identifying the patient and purpose of the call and incorporating professional language and clear explanations. They require development in providing structure and incorporating core communication skills. Compared with our survey results, the student findings are at odds with clinicians' expectations of students' communication abilities. We conclude that additional training is required to familiarize students with expectations regarding telephone communication, including reviewing the case thoroughly, preparing to answer questions and provide explanations, following organizational protocol, and incorporating open ended questions, reflective listening, and empathy. This data will inform design, and help to measure the impact, of telephone communication education and training that will be incorporated into the existing veterinary communication curriculum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty Japanese Black calves were randomly assigned to two groups. Fifteen calves received 20 mg of beta-carotene supplemented into their daily provided rations from 2 to 8 weeks of age (BC group), and the other 15 calves did not receive the daily beta-carotene supplement (control group). All calves received a commercially available modified live bovine respiratory syncytial (RS) virus vaccine at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age. At 4 weeks of age, the concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites within serum were significantly lower in the BC group than the concentrations measured in the control group. Also at 4 weeks of age, the concentration of biological antioxidant capacity within serum was significantly higher in the BC group than the concentrations measured in the control group. Both groups showed a gradual decrease of antibody titers to live bovine RS virus in the samples taken from 2 to 12 weeks of age. These results confirmed that beta-carotene supplementation decreased oxidative stress. However, beta-carotene supplementation did not affect the antibody response to live bovine RS virus vaccination, perhaps due to the presence of the maternal antibody.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In view of the previously reported changes in tissue neuropeptide concentrations in cows with AD, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of AD and breed on serum neuropeptide concentrations. For this purpose, blood samples of 33 German Holstein (GH) cows with AD, 36 healthy controls (GH), and 32 healthy German Fleckvieh (GF) cows were collected, and concentrations of substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and interleukin1&#946; (IL-1&#946;) were measured via commercially available ELISA kits. To examine the effect of AD, we compared GH cows with and without AD and observed no significant effects of AD on SP, VIP, or Il-1 &#946; concentrations. To evaluate the effect of breed, we compared healthy GH with healthy GF cows and detected markedly higher VIP serum levels in the healthy GF cows (p &lt; 0.01). No significant differences in SP or IL-1&#946; were detected. According to our results, there seems to be no effect of AD on the serum concentrations of SP, VIP, or IL-1 &#946;. In contrast, there seems to be a breed difference concerning serum VIP concentrations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human patients with advanced B-cell leukemia or lymphoma, infusions with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-lymphocytes have shown promising responses. However, the scientific and clinical development of cell-based therapies for dogs, who get cancer of similar types as humans, is lagging behind. One reason is that immune cells and their functionality in dogs are less well characterized, largely due a lack of canine-specific reagents to detect surface markers, and specific cytokines to isolate and expand their immune cells. This review summarizes the current status of canine cancer immunotherapies, with focus on autologous and allogeneic T-lymphocytes, as well as NK cells, and discusses potential initiatives that would allow therapies with canine immune cells to "catch up" with the advances in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In 2008, during a FMD outbreak on a dairy farm, milk delivery was banned for 30 days. This was a part of movement management, a key strategy for FMD control in dairy farms in the area. In 2009, more than half the animals on a pig farm were affected by FMD. Animal quarantine and restricted animal movement played a key role in preventing the spread of FMD. In 2010, FMD infection was reported in a captive elephant. The suspected source of virus was a FMD-infected cow on the same premises. The infected elephant was moved to an elephant hospital that was located in a different province before the diagnosis was confirmed. FMD education was given to elephant veterinarians to promote FMD prevention and control strategies in this unique species. These three cases illustrate how differences in outbreak circumstances and species require the implementation of a variety of different FMD control and prevention measures. Control measures and responses should be customized in different outbreak situations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Indeed, there is a growing interest in their presence and persistence in the environment because low levels of antibiotics may favour the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Moreover, antibiotics present in honey may produce residues in foodstuffs, causing adverse effects on humans such as allergic reactions, toxic effects and damage to the central nervous systems. For food and health/safety reasons, antibiotic drugs are not authorized for the treatment of honey bees in the EU, even though these antimicrobial drugs have been approved in many third-party countries. For this reason, contaminated honey products can still be found in European markets. Therefore, there is a need to develop a precise, accurate and sensitive analytical method that may be used to simply and rapidly detect these compounds in honey. The aim of our study was to detect the presence of antibiotics in Apulian honey using the Anti-Microbial array II (AM II) as an innovative screening method to test the health quality of honey and honey products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The techniques used for the diagnosis of ARtV-A include electron microscopy, isolation in cell culture, and serology, as well as molecular techniques, such as the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The objective of this work was to standardize a real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using SYBR Green chemistry for the rapid detection and quantification of ARtV-A from bird tissues and materials fixed on FTA cards on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of segment 6 (S6), which codes for the structural VP6 protein of ARtV-A. The results show the efficient amplification of the proposed target, with a limit of detection (LoD) of one copy gene (CG) per microliter of cDNA and a limit of quantification (LoQ) of 10 CGs per microliter. The efficiency of the primers was determined to be 95.66% using a standard curve, with an R[2] value of 0.999 and a slope of -3.43. The specificity was determined using samples coinfected with ARtV-A, the chicken parvovirus, the chicken astrovirus, and the avian nephritis virus as positive controls and commercially available vaccines of the infectious bronchitis virus, infectious bursa disease virus, avian reovirus and healthy organs as negative controls. This technique, which lacks nonspecific PCR products and dimers, demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional RT-PCR, and it reduced the analysis time by more than 50%.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Interestingly, triple-negative tumors are the most common molecular subtype in female dogs. In this study, we proposed to evaluate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and microvascular density (MVD) in a group of metastatic and nonmetastatic triple-negative CMT and compare the expression based on clinical parameters. Twenty-six female dogs with triple-negative mammary tumors were divided into three groups: nonmetastatic tumors (NMT) (n = 11), tumors with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (n = 10), and tumors with lung metastasis (LM) (n = 5). We observed increased VEGFR-2 expression in LNM compared with NMT and a positive correlation between tumor grade and VEGFR-2 expression. A positive correlation was noted between VEGFR-2 and PDGFR expression. Regarding microvascular density (MVD), we identified a higher number of vessels in primary tumors with lymph node metastasis and lung metastasis compared with tumors with no metastasis. The primary tumors with lung metastasis exhibited an increased MVD compared with carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Overall, our results suggest a deregulation of VEGFR-2 and PDGFR and high MVD in metastatic tumors, indicating a role for angiogenesis in tumor progression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the literature is not clear on the involvement of neuroimmune interactions in a heat stress situation associated with bacterial and parasitic infections. The present study evaluated the production of monoamines and their metabolites in brain regions (rostral pallium, hypothalamus, brain stem, and midbrain) in broiler chickens submitted to chronic heat stress and/or infection and co-infection with Eimeria spp. and Clostridium perfringens type A. The heat stress and avian necrotic enteritis (NE) modulated the neurochemical profile of monoamines in different areas of the central nervous system, in particular, those related to the activity of the hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenal (HPA) axis that is responsible for sickness behavior. C. perfringens and/or Eimeria infection, heat stress increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 4,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and DOPAC/dopamine (DA) in the rostral pallium; 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), HVA/DA, DOPAC/DA, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT in the hypothalamus; MHPG, 5-HIAA/5-HT, DOPAC/DA, and HVA/DA in the midbrain; and MHPG, DOPAC, HVA, HVA/DA, DOPAC/DA, and 5-HIAA/5-HT in the brainstem. Heat stress decreased noradrenaline + norepinephrine (NOR + AD) in all brain regions analyzed; 5-HT in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and brainstem; and DA in the midbrain. The results also showed the existence and activity of the brain-gut axis in broiler chickens. The brain neurochemical profile and corticosterone production are consistent with those observed in chronic stressed mammals, in animals with sickness behavior, and an overloading of the HPA axis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30634569</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Innate Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Viruses in Ducks and Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Mallard ducks are important natural hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and many strains circulate in this reservoir and cause little harm. Some strains can be transmitted to other hosts, including chickens, and cause respiratory and systemic disease. Rarely, these highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause disease in mallards, while chickens are highly susceptible. The long co-evolution of mallard ducks with influenza viruses has undoubtedly fine-tuned many immunological host[-]pathogen interactions to confer resistance to disease, which are poorly understood. Here, we compare innate responses to different avian influenza viruses in ducks and chickens to reveal differences that point to potential mechanisms of disease resistance. Mallard ducks are permissive to LPAI replication in their intestinal tissues without overtly compromising their fitness. In contrast, the mallard response to HPAI infection reflects an immediate and robust induction of type I interferon and antiviral interferon stimulated genes, highlighting the importance of the RIG-I pathway. Ducks also appear to limit the duration of the response, particularly of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Chickens lack RIG-I, and some modulators of the signaling pathway and may be compromised in initiating an early interferon response, allowing more viral replication and consequent damage. We review current knowledge about innate response mediators to influenza infection in mallard ducks compared to chickens to gain insight into protective immune responses, and open questions for future research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

When pain recognition and quantification abilities were used as a perceived competence of proper pain assessment, only 83/131 (63.4%, confidence interval (CI) 0.55[-]0.72) were deemed to have satisfactory skills, with the rest considered to be deficient. There were 49/131 (37.4) veterinarians who had participated in continuing education programs and were more confident assessing pain, with an odds ratio (&#177;standard error) of 2.84 &#177; 1.15 (p = 0.01; CI 1.27[-]6.32). In addition, the odds of using pain scales was 4.28 &#177; 2.17 (p &lt; 0.01, CI 1.58[-]11.55) greater if they had also participated in continuing education programs. The term multimodal analgesia was familiar to 77 (58.7%) veterinarians who also claimed to use more than one approach to pain control. Nevertheless, homeopathy was the preferred alternative approach in 71/77 (92%). There were major misconceptions on side effects and/or contraindications for use of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by most veterinarians. In addition, the lack of multimodal analgesia by at least 40% of the practitioners, combined with heavy reliance on weak analgesics (i.e., tramadol) or those with no proven record of efficacy (homeopathic remedies), denotes major deficits in education at the undergraduate level and a need for additional continuing education designed to fulfill the gaps in knowledge identified in this study, and overcome ideological convictions not supported by scientific evidence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-two lactating buffaloes artificially inseminated (AI) were utilized. Blood was collected at Days 0, 14, 18, 28, 40 after AI (AI = day 0). Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound at Days 28 and 40 post AI. Out of 32 buffaloes, 14 were pregnant (P group) and 18 were not pregnant (NP group). The plasma PAG-2 threshold of 1.0 ng/mL in the P group was reached at day 40 post AI. PAG2 mRNA expression differed between the P and NP groups, and was either evaluated in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMN), starting from day 14. However, both the estimated marginal means and multiple comparisons showed that PAG2 mRNA expression was higher in PMN than PBMC. In the present study, PAG-2 appeared in the blood (40 Days post AI), and an early expression of PAG2 mRNA at Day 14 post AI was also observed. Although further research is undoubtedly required, PAG2 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes could be using to better understand the role that PAGs play during pregnancy in buffalo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The development of effective PRRS vaccines, which deviate from live virus designs, would be an important step towards the control of PRRS. Potential vaccine antigens are found in the five surface proteins of the virus, which form covalent and multiple noncovalent interactions and possess hypervariable epitopes. Consequences of this complex surface structure include antigenic variability and escape from immunity, thus presenting challenges in the development of new vaccines capable of generating broadly sterilizing immunity. One potential vaccine target is the induction of antibody that disrupts the interaction between the macrophage CD163 receptor and the GP2, GP3, and GP4 heterotrimer that protrudes from the surface of the virion. Studies to understand this interaction by mapping mutations that appear following the escape of virus from neutralizing antibody identify the ectodomain regions of GP5 and M as important immune sites. As a target for antibody, GP5 possesses a conserved epitope flanked by N-glycosylation sites and hypervariable regions, a pattern of conserved epitopes shared by other viruses. Resolving this apparent conundrum is needed to advance PRRS vaccine development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We gathered evidence and data from scientific literature, on risk factors for AMR in farmers, and on the prevalence of those hazards across farming phases. We administered semi-structured interviews to public and private veterinarians in Northern Italy, to obtain detailed information on turkey farming phases, and on working practices. Data were then integrated into a semi-quantitative Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA). Those working practices, which are characterized by direct contact with numerous animals, and which are carried out frequently, with rare use of personal protection devices resulted as associated with the greatest probability of exposure to AMR. For methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), these included vaccination and administration of any individual therapy, and removal and milling of litter, given the exposure of farmers to high dust level. Indeed, levels of occupational exposure to MRSA are enhanced by its transmission routes, which include direct contact with animal, as well as airborne transmission. Level of exposure to extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) is more strictly associated with direct contact and the oral-fecal route. Consequently, exposure to ESBL resulted and associated with the routinely tipping over of poults turned on their back, and with the individual administration of therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sarcoids are locally invasive fibroblastic skin tumors that represent the most common skin neoplasms in horses worldwide. The transmission mechanism of BPV is still controversial in horses. Thus far, direct and indirect routes have been implicated, while vertical transmission has been suggested after the detection of viral DNA in the semen of healthy stallions. Testing of the blood and placenta of non-sarcoid baring mares and their respective foals revealed that the equine placenta can harbor BPV DNA, leading us to speculate a possible prenatal vertical DNA transmission in equids.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Biological behavior is highly variable, usually aggressive, and frequently metastatic, with reported survival times of three months for oral or mucosal melanomas in advanced disease stages. Classical clinical management remains challenging; thus, novel and more efficacious treatment strategies are needed. Evidence-based medicine supports the role of the immune system to treat neoplastic diseases. Besides, immunotherapy offers the possibility of a precise medicinal approach to treat cancer. In recent years, multiple immunotherapeutic strategies have been developed, and are now recognized as a pillar of treatment. In addition, dogs represent a good model for translational medicine purposes. This review will cover the most relevant immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of canine malignant melanoma, divided among five different categories, namely, monoclonal antibodies, nonspecific immunotherapy activated by bacteria, vaccines, gene therapy, and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since no information is available in canine prostate carcinoma (PC) and normal prostate tissues, the aims of this study were to evaluate the possible correlations between MC distribution, molecular expression and microvessel density (MVD) in normal prostatic tissue and proliferative disorders of the canine prostate. All samples (6 normal, 15 benign prostate hyperplasia-BPH, 8 PC) were stained with Toluidine Blue and immunohistochemically evaluated for tryptase, c-Kit (CD117) and CD31. Mast cell density (MCD) and MVD were quantified by the hot-spot method. MCD was significantly increased in periglandular/peritumoral areas, when compared with intraglandular/intratumoral areas, in all groups (p = 0.03). C-Kit expression was strongly associated with PC (&#961; = 0.75 p = 0.03), whereas positive correlation between tryptase and c-Kit expression (&#961; = 0.64 p = 0.01) was observed in periglandular areas of BPH. MVD showed a correlation with MCD in BPH (&#961; = 0.54 p = 0.04). Our data support the importance of c-Kit in regulating MC proliferation. The predominant location of MCs in peritumoral areas of canine PC was similar to the human counterpart, in which PC cells are supposed to produce substances attracting MCs to the tumor microenvironment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a hemodynamic parameter able to discriminate preload dependent subjects. Anesthesia records of dogs undergoing laparoscopy were retrospectively evaluated. The anesthetic protocol included acepromazine, methadone, propofol and isoflurane administered with oxygen under mechanical ventilation. The hemodynamic parameters were considered five minutes before (BASE) and ten minutes after (P10) the pneumoperitoneum. Based on the cardiac index (CI) variation, at P10, dogs were classified as sensitive (S group, CI &#8804; 15%) and non-sensitive (NO-S group). Data were analyzed with the ANOVA test and the ROC curve (p &lt; 0.05). Fifty-five percent of dogs (S) had a reduction of CI &#8805; 15% at P10 (2.97 &#177; 1.4 L/min/m[2]) compared to BASE (4.32 &#177; 1.62 L/min/m[2]) and at P10 in the NO-S group (4.51 &#177; 1.41 L/min/m[2]). PPV at BASE was significantly higher in the S group (22.4% &#177; 6.1%) compared to the NO-S group (10.9% &#177; 3.3%). The ROC curve showed a threshold of PPV &gt; 16% to distinguish the S and NO-S groups. PPV may be a valid predictor of the hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum in dogs. A PPV &gt; 16% can identify patients that may require fluid administration before the creation of pneumoperitoneum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim is to neutralize the cranial tibial thrust (CTT) and to reach a 90&#176; angle between the patellar tendon and the tibial plateau with a physiological knee extension of 135&#176;. In our study, a Ti6AI4V ELI (Titanium Aluminium Vanadium) titanium scaffold for the Porous TTA, with excellent properties of osteointegration and osteoconduction when subjected to cyclic loading has been adopted. Based on the previous scientific work on an ovine model, the use of this type of porous scaffolds has subverted the previous models. Scaffold production technology is based on direct mechanical manufacturing called Electron Beam Melting (EBM). For this study, 41 dogs, different breeds, medium-large size, weighing between 10 and 80 kg, aged between 1 and 13 years, were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were based on clinical evaluations (different gaits), drawer test and tibial compression, LOAD score (Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs questionnaire), radiographic diagnosis in sedation with a 135&#176; positioning of the joint and baropodometric investigations (Stance Analyzer). The results show that Porous TTA is an excellent method for functional recovery of the knee joint following the partial and total rupture of the CCL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here we investigated Italian veterinary students' demographic data and perceptions about nonhuman animal welfare issues that might be predictive of their attitudes. A survey eliciting information about demographics, knowledge, experience, and perceptions regarding different categories of animals, and including the Animal Attitude Scale (AAS), was administered to undergraduate veterinary medicine students in three Italian universities. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests, and a value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In total, 876 students completed the questionnaire, with females (75.1%) making up a majority of students in all years of the course. Although veterinary students showed pro-animal welfare attitudes (mean score = 64.20 &#177; 0.24 out of 100), the findings suggested that year of study, gender, and geographical location had a significant impact (p &lt; 0.05). In this study, we found a set of factors that, either individually or combined, help predict a student's attitude toward animal welfare issues, which will be useful in improving the curriculum strategy in veterinary education in Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To prevent this disease, important efforts to monitor the situation in the main source, livestock, are conducted in most developed countries. In the European Union, European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) and European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) compile information at the member-state level, even though important differences in production systems and surveillance systems exist. Here, Salmonella surveillance systems in one of the main sources of foodborne salmonellosis, swine, and humans in Spain were reviewed to identify potential gaps and discuss potential ways of integration under a "One-Health" approach. Despite the extensive information generated through the surveillance activities, source attribution can be only routinely performed through ad-hoc outbreak investigations, and national reports on human outbreaks do not provide sufficiently detailed information to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the pathogen. Human and animal monitoring of Salmonella would benefit from a better exchange of information and collaboration. Analysis of spatio-temporal trends in livestock and humans could help to identify likely sources of infection and to target surveillance efforts in areas with higher prevalence or where specific strains are found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Previous work suggests the conformation of these breeds of sheep may be predisposing these animals to laryngeal disease. This study evaluated the anatomy of the Texel sheep larynx and describes incidental pathology. Forty-three larynges from rams of the Texel and Bluefaced Leicester breeds of sheep were measured and photographed. A larynx from each breed was submitted for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Measurements, photography, CT, and MRI demonstrated a difference in the anatomy of the larynx between breeds and a higher proportion of Texel sheep had laryngeal lesions. This study supports the hypothesis that the anatomy of the Texel sheep could be pre-disposing the breed to laryngeal chondritis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight normal prostates and 10 PC from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were used. Collagen fibers area was analyzed with ImageJ software. The distribution of Coll-I and Coll-III was approximately 80% around prostatic ducts and acini, 15% among smooth muscle, and 5% surrounding blood vessels, in both normal prostate and PC. There was a higher median area of Coll-III in PC when compared to normal prostatic tissue (p = 0.001 for PSR and p = 0.05 for IHC). Immunostaining for Coll-IV was observed in the basal membrane of prostate acini, smooth muscle, blood vessels, and nerve fibers of normal and PC samples. Although there was no difference in Coll-IV area between normal tissue and PC, tumors with Gleason score 10 showed absence of Coll-IV, when compared to scores 6 and 8 (p = 0.0095). Elastic fibers were found in the septa dividing the lobules and around the prostatic acini of normal samples and were statistically higher in PC compared to normal tissue (p = 0.00229). Investigation of ECM components brings new information and should be correlated with prognosis in future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Conventional pharmacological therapy cannot reverse the progression of the disease and, in humans, cardiac transplantation remains the only option during the final stages of heart failure. Cytoprotective gene therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor-B167 (VEGF-B167) has proved an effective alternative therapy, halting the progression of the disease in experimental studies on dogs. The aim of this work was to test the tolerability and feasibility of intracoronary administration, under fluoroscopic guidance, of VEGF-B167 carried by adeno-associated viral vectors in canine DCM patients. Ten patients underwent the gene delivery procedure. The intraoperative phase was well tolerated by all dogs. Clinical and echocardiographic assessments at 7- and 30-days post-procedure showed stable conditions compared to the pre-procedure phase. The results of this work indicate that intracoronary VEGF-B167 gene delivery is feasible and tolerated in dogs with DCM. Further monitoring/investigations are ongoing to evaluate the effects of this therapy on disease progression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Indigenous domesticated Neo-tropical animals include South American camelids, (Lama gunacoa, Lama glama, Lama pacos, Vicuna vicuna), guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and ducks (Cairina moschata, Anas platyrhynchos, Dendrocyga autumnalis). These animals were chosen due to their origin of existence (Neo-tropics) and over time these animals became domesticated and were distributed throughout the world. Over eighty (80) references were collected for this review and the papers spanned over eighty (80) years from 1934 to 2018. The gastrointestinal parasites reported for each animal were tabulated and their effects in the animal noted. Parasites reported in domesticated Neo-tropical animals had little to no effect on wild and free ranging animals with a few cases of illness and decreased productivity. The majority of articles viewed these animals as reservoir host which can infect humans and other domesticated livestock. It must also be noted that research done in the past did not focus on the effect these parasites had on these animals but only observed their potential as reservoirs for parasitic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decreases nutrient digestibility and limits the availability of n-3 FA. Addition of carbohydrase enzymes to flaxseed-based diets can decrease the anti-nutritive effects of NSP. We hypothesized that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation affect lipid content and alter expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in broiler liver. Five day-old broiler chicks were fed a corn-soybean basal diet with 0% flaxseed, a basal diet with 10% of flaxseed, or 10% flaxseed + 0.05% enzyme diet up to day 42 of growth. Total lipids, including long-chain (&#8805;20C) n-3 FA and monounsaturated FA, were increased in flax-fed broiler livers. Enzyme addition reduced arachidonic acid and total long chain n-6 FA. These changes were similarly reflected in phosphatidylcholine lipid species. Dietary flax and enzyme treatments up-regulated PPAR&#945; target genes CPT1A and ACOX1 while reducing expression of de novo FA synthesis-related genes. This study concludes that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation in broiler diets enhances LC n-3 FA species, while reducing n-6 FA species in hepatic phospholipids (PL). Flaxseed-based diets changes the expression of genes involved in FA lipid metabolism without affecting growth or production performance in broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PRDC results in reduced performance as well as increased mortality rates and production costs in the pig industry worldwide. This review focuses on the interactions of two enveloped RNA viruses-porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SwIV)-as major etiological agents that contribute to PRDC within the porcine cellular innate immunity during infection. The innate immune system of the porcine lung includes alveolar and parenchymal/interstitial macrophages, neutrophils (PMN), conventional dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid DC, natural killer cells, and &#947;&#948; T cells, thus the in vitro and in vivo interactions between those cells and PRRSV and SwIV are reviewed. Likewise, the few studies regarding PRRSV-SwIV co-infection are illustrated together with the different modulation mechanisms that are induced by the two viruses. Alterations in responses by natural killer (NK), PMN, or &#947;&#948; T cells have not received much attention within the scientific community as their counterpart antigen-presenting cells and there are numerous gaps in the knowledge regarding the role of those cells in both infections. This review will help in paving the way for future directions in PRRSV and SwIV research and enhancing the understanding of the innate mechanisms that are involved during infection with these viruses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

AP diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP[&#174;] cPL&#8482; test and compatible imaging. Urinary KI (uKI) was defined if dogs had urinary casts and/or proteinuria. Dogs (n = 70) were divided in survivors and non-survivors according to the 15-day outcome. Data were analyzed using statistical software. Seventy dogs were retrospectively included, of which 24 dogs (34%) died. uKI was detected in 36 dogs (37%) which was associated with mortality (p = 0.01, Odds ratio (OR) 3.9, 95% CI 1.3[-]11.56). Non-survivors showed higher dipstick bilirubin levels than survivors (p = 0.0022). By excluding active sediments, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) &#8805;2 was associated with mortality (p = 0.001, OR 47.5, 95% CI 4[-]571.9). The uGGT/uCr was available in 40 dogs, although no association of this factor with any outcome was found. The UPC &#8805;2 can be a negative prognostic factor in canine AP and further studies on uGGT/uCr are warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We collected ticks by dragging, and from collectors' clothes in three hiking trails, which were divided into an internal path, with short vegetation, and an external part with taller grass. Dragging yielded 285 Ixodes ricinus nymphs and 31 adults, and two Dermacentor marginatus adults. Eleven I. ricinus nymphs and 9 adults were collected from collectors' clothes. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was identified by PCR in 12 out of 30 I. ricinus nymphs (prevalence = 40.0%, 95% confidence interval = 22.5, 57.5). The prevalence of infection by Rickettsia spp. was 13.3% (95% CI = 1.2, 25.5). The probability of encountering at least one questing I. ricinus infected by each bacterial agent (probability of exposure, E) in 100 m[2] was obtained by combining the number of collected nymphs, the prevalence of infection by each bacterial agent, the frequency of passage by visitors, and the probability of tick attachment to people. The mean number of nymphs collected by dragging was greatest in the internal part of hiking trails (mean = 7.9). Conversely, E was greater in the external part (up to 0.14 for B. burgdorferi s.l., and 0.07 for Rickettsia spp.), due to a greater probability of tick attachment to people in relatively tall vegetation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is a pressing need for discovering nematicides due to the spread of resistance to currently used drugs. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a formidable experimentally tractable model organism that offers key advantages in accelerating nematicide discovery. We report the screening of drug-like libraries using an overnight high-throughput C. elegans assay, based on an automated infrared motility reader. As a proof of concept, we screened the "Pathogen Box" library, and identical results to a previous screen using Haemonchus contortus were obtained. We then screened an in-house library containing a diversity of compound families. Most active compounds had a conjugation of an unsaturation with an electronegative atom (N, O, or S) and an aromatic ring. Importantly, we identified symmetric arylidene ketones and aryl hydrazine derivatives as novel nematicides. Furthermore, one of these compounds, (1E,2E)-1,2-bis(thiophen-3-ylmethylene)hydrazine, was active as a nematicide at 25 &#181;m, but innocuous to the vertebrate model zebrafish at 50 &#181;m. Our results identified novel nematicidal scaffolds and illustrate the value of C. elegans in accelerating nematicide discovery using a nonlabor-intensive automated assay that provides a simple overnight readout.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-eight adult does of 6 months of age were divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D; n = 7), with comparable average body weight (bw). Group A rabbits received only distilled water daily and served as a control, while groups B, C, and D received, respectively, 10 mg/kg bw, 20 mg/ kg bw, and 40 mg/kg bw of potassium dichromate via gavage for 28 days, after which animals were anesthetized with ether vapor and sacrificed. Blood samples were obtained via cardiac puncture and collected without anticoagulant for biochemical dosages and with anticoagulant (EDTA) for complete blood count. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) were dosed in serum and in homogenates of ovary with the help of AccuDiag[TM] ELISA kits from OMEGA DIAGNOSTICS LTD (Scotland, England) while respecting the immuno-enzymatic method. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver, kidney, ovary and uterus were measured. Hematology revealed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in mean values of hemoglobin and platelets while white blood cells and lymphocytes showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in exposed groups. No significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference was registered in monocytes, red blood cells, hematocrits, and plaquetocrits values with respect to the control. No matter the organ considered, no significant (p &gt; 0.05) change was recorded in weight and volume. Nephrotoxicity analysis registered a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in urea and creatinine, unlike renal tissue protein, which decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). However, hepatotoxicity registered no significant (p &gt; 0.05) variation in aspartate aminotransferase but total protein, alanine aminotransferase, and total cholesterol increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05), while hepatic tissue protein revealed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease. Analysis on reproductive parameters showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in ovarian and uterine tissue proteins, as well as in follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol. Oxidative stress markers recorded no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in glutathione reductase except in ovary where a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease was seen when compared with the control, while catalase revealed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease, except in liver where there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) change. Superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde recorded a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease and increase respectively, with respect to the control. Results obtained from this study showed that the reduction process of chromium in tissues may cause the generation of reactive oxygen species, which are involved in hematoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and reproductive toxicity effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between breed (terrier versus non-terrier dogs), histological grade, COX-2 expression, and BRAF mutation in canine TCC. Therefore, transmural TCC biopsies from 65 dogs (15 terriers, 50 non-terriers) were graded histologically into low- and high-grade. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the intensity of COX-2 expression was performed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Exon 15 of chromosome 16 was examined for the BRAF variant c.1799T&gt;A by TaqMan[&#174;] SNP assay. TCC was low-grade in 20 cases (one terrier, 19 non-terriers) and high-grade in 45 cases (14 terriers, 31 non-terriers). Contrary to humans, histological grade was not significantly correlated to the intensity of COX-2 expression. BRAF mutation was detected in 11/15 (73%) TCC of terriers and in 18/50 (36%) TCC of non-terriers. Histological grade and BRAF mutation were not correlated significantly (p = 0.2912). Terriers had a considerably higher prevalence of high-grade tumors (p &lt; 0.0001), as well as of BRAF mutation (p &#8804; 0.05) compared to non-terriers. In non-terriers, neoplasms with BRAF mutation showed a significantly higher intensity of COX-2 expression than those without BRAF mutation (p &#8804; 0.05). In conclusion, in contrast to humans, testing for BRAF mutation in canine TCC is a sensitive diagnostic method especially in terriers (73%) and may be recommended as a screening test. However, evidence of BRAF mutation in canine TCC is not a predictor for the histological grade. Moreover, a positive correlation between histological grade and the intensity of COX-2 expression was not found. Further studies are necessary to clarify the clinical and prognostic relevance of the elevated intensity of COX-2 expression of TCC with BRAF mutation detected in non-terriers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, epidemiological models require careful delineation of transmission routes. Understanding transmission routes will improve the quality and success of control programs. We aimed to study the infection dynamics of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causal agent of ruminant Johne's disease, and to distinguish within-host mutation from individual transmission events in a longitudinally MAP-defined dairy herd in upstate New York. To this end, semi-annual fecal samples were obtained from a single dairy herd over the course of seven years, in addition to tissue samples from a selection of culled animals. All samples were cultured for MAP, and multi-locus short-sequence repeat (MLSSR) typing was used to determine MAP SSR types. We concluded from these precise MAP infection data that, when the tissue burden remains low, the majority of MAP infections are not detectable by routine fecal culture but will be identified when tissue culture is performed after slaughter. Additionally, we determined that in this herd vertical infection played only a minor role in MAP transmission. By means of extensive and precise longitudinal data from a single dairy herd, we have come to new insights regarding MAP co-infections and within-host evolution.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has gained widespread acceptance by veterinary surgeons and is experiencing rapid growth and frequency of use. Many neoplastic diseases in the abdomen and thorax of dogs and cats can be treated as effectively with MIS as with traditional open surgery. Additionally, MIS allows for less invasive options for organ biopsy in cancer patients either for initial diagnosis or for staging to inform prognosis and treatment. Despite the recent increase in MIS, additional research is required to further characterize the benefits to oncology patients and to ensure that surgical oncologic principles and patient outcomes are not compromised by the use of MIS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Currently, few immunohistochemical markers have been established to predict the prognosis of a canine MGT. However, p53 immunostaining has been variably reported to be prognostic for canine MGTs. Additionally, while p16[CDK2NA] protein (p16) immunostaining has been found to be prognostic for human breast cancers, this marker has never been evaluated as a prognostic marker for canine neoplasms. In the present study, the prognostic utility of p53 and p16 was evaluated in 35 canine malignant MGTs. It was observed that 19 (54%) dogs died due to their MGTs with an overall mean survival time (MST) of 882 days. Seven MGTs showed p53 immunostaining, but this was not significantly associated with death (4 of 7 vs. 15 of 28; p = 0.6) or MST (670 vs. 934 days; p = 0.57). Five dogs had MGTs with no p16 immunostaining, 28 MGTs had intermediate p16 immunostaining, and two MGTs had increased p16 immunostaining. Neither death due to MGT (4 of 5, 14 of 28, or 1 of 2; p = 0.28) nor MST (683, 927, and 307 days; p = 0.31) were significantly associated with p16 immunostaining. Interestingly, p53 immunostaining was significantly associated with an increase or loss of p16 immunostaining. This is the first time that p16 has been evaluated as a prognostic marker for canine neoplasms. While these results suggest that a proportion of canine MGTs develop by cellular mechanisms that alter both p53 and p16 expression, there was no evidence that defects in p53 or p16 alter the behavior of a MGT. Neither p53 nor p16 was found to significantly predict prognosis, although this could reflect the limited number of MGTs included in the study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As a source of nematode eggs, pooled fresh fecal samples taken from dairy donkeys naturally infected by gastrointestinal nematodes were used. From fecal samples, eggs were recovered, suspended in deionized water, and used immediately in the bioassay (egg hatch test). The activity of the tested compounds was compared to positive (0.1% thiabendazole) and negative (deionized water and 1% DMSO) controls. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and the obtained data were statistically analyzed. All the tested plant compounds caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition of nematode egg hatching (&gt;80%). Moreover, all saponins and prosapogenins showed in vitro anthelmintic properties statistically comparable to that of the reference drug (p &lt; 0.05), except for MPS extract. Obtained results showed that the different Medicago saponins evaluated in this study possess high anthelmintic properties against gastrointestinal nematodes of dairy donkeys, although to a different extent depending on their composition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present investigation was aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), metabolic gene networks and metabolic pathways in bovine liver transcriptome of young bulls. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the bovine liver transcriptome of dairy (Polish Holstein Friesian (HF); n = 6), beef (Hereford; n = 6), and dual purpose (Polish-Red; n = 6) cattle breeds. This study identified 895, 338, and 571 significant (p &lt; 0.01) differentially expressed (DE) gene-transcripts represented as 745, 265, and 498 hepatic DE genes through the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red breeds comparisons, respectively. By combining all breeds comparisons, 75 hepatic DE genes (p &lt; 0.01) were identified as commonly shared among all the three breed comparisons; 70, 160, and 38 hepatic DE genes were commonly shared between the following comparisons: (i) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Hereford; (ii) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red; and (iii) Polish-HF versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red, respectively. A total of 440, 82, and 225 hepatic DE genes were uniquely observed for the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-Red versus Polish-HF comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified top-ranked enriched GO terms (p &lt; 0.01) including 17, 16, and 31 functional groups and 151, 61, and 140 gene functions that were DE in all three breed liver transcriptome comparisons. Gene network analysis identified several potential metabolic pathways involved in glutamine family amino-acid, triglyceride synthesis, gluconeogenesis, p38MAPK cascade regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis (Polish-Red versus Hereford); IGF-receptor signaling, catecholamine transport, lipoprotein lipase, tyrosine kinase binding receptor (Polish-HF versus Hereford), and PGF-receptor binding, (Polish-HF versus Polish-Red). Validation results showed that the relative expression values were consistent to those obtained by RNA-seq, and significantly correlated between the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA-seq (Pearson's r &gt; 0.90). Our results provide new insights on bovine liver gene expressions among dairy versus dual versus beef breeds by identifying the large numbers of DEGs markers submitted to NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE114233, which can serve as useful genetic tools to develop the gene assays for trait-associated studies as well as, to effectively implement in genomics selection (GS) cattle breeding programs in Poland.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study is to find out the prevalence and characteristics of these strains, as well as their evolution in healthy pigs on the Island of Tenerife, Spain. Between October 2009 and December 2010, 300 pigs from 15 wean-to-finishing farms were screened. Between 1 September 2017 and 31 March 2018, a new sampling was performed collecting 125 nasal swabs from pigs belonging to the same farms and under the same conditions as the previous study. MRSA antibiotic resistant patterns were studied. Results: Prevalence of MRSA isolates was 89.6%. All isolates belonged to Sequence Type 398 (ST398), a livestock related strain. All strains studied were resistant to beta-lactamic non-carbapenemic antibiotics and sensitive to teicoplanin, linezolid, vancomycin, rifampicin, quinupristin-dalfospristin, and mupirocine. Between 2009/2010-2017/2018 a significant increase in resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole, clindamycin, Fosfomycin, and tigecycline antibiotics was observed in isolated MRSA strains compared to the previous period. We consider a major control and surveillance program of antibiotic use in veterinary care is needed in order to reduce the presence of MRSA strains in livestock and control this significant multi-resistance increase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The IPVM of different bird species was evaluated to test the penetrating ability of avian spermatozoa in an intra- and interspecies design. Isolation of the IPVM via acid hydrolysis was tested in pre-incubated chicken eggs and in six other avian species. The separation protocol was modified (time, acid concentration) to facilitate practicability. Separated membranes were evaluated with dark field microscopy for the presence of holes produced by penetrating spermatozoa. In chicken eggs, the influence of different membrane storage conditions was tested. In the penetration assay, the IPVM of chicken eggs was used as a model for fresh and frozen-thawed rooster sperm and for fresh spermatozoa of cockatiels and falcons. Results demonstrated that the time of egg-incubation had a significantly negative influence on the isolation ability of the IPVM (p &lt; 0.0001). IPVM-separation was successful for a maximum of two days after preincubation. In the experiments with eggs from other avian species, results were heterogenous: there was no isolation in geese and cockatiels, 20% in the European kestrel, and 40% in pheasant, quail, and duck. In the penetration assay, holes were found in 100% of the IPVM of chicken eggs after incubation with native and frozen-thawed rooster semen and in 10% with fresh cockatiel semen. Falcon spermatozoa failed to produce visible holes. In conclusion, the IPVM of chicken eggs seems to be unsuitable to establish a functional sperm assay in other species tested but is suitable for quality evaluation of cryopreserved rooster sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases that infect humans, agricultural animals, and wildlife. Within the subset of zoonoses, vector-borne pathogens are changing more rapidly with climate change, and have a complex epidemiology, which may allow them to take advantage of a changing environment. Most mosquito-borne infectious diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes in three genera: Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex, and the expansion of these genera is well documented. There is an urgent need to study vector-borne diseases in response to climate change and to produce a generalizable approach capable of generating risk maps and forecasting outbreaks. Here, we provide a strategy for coupling climate and epidemiological models for zoonotic infectious diseases. We discuss the complexity and challenges of data and model fusion, baseline requirements for data, and animal and human population movement. Disease forecasting needs significant investment to build the infrastructure necessary to collect data about the environment, vectors, and hosts at all spatial and temporal resolutions. These investments can contribute to building a modeling community around the globe to support public health officials so as to reduce disease burden through forecasts with quantified uncertainty.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These features can strongly depend on feeding and management. In this perspective, the screening of milk samples intended for Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano located in Northern Italy was performed, focusing on a panel of volatile molecules. The work was carried out on a total number of 25 bovine milk samples for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. Milk samples were collected from May to September and analyzed for volatile molecules using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry. A range of several volatile molecule classes was considered (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, solforates). Results showed a significant influence of the month and destination of milk due to the time period and subsequent use in cheesemaking (Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano). Significant differences between months were observed for all volatiles. These preliminary results indicate differences between the two types of milk due to the period and destination. The study of volatile molecules in milk will give important information about the physiology of milk and the evolution of dairy products. These features must be extended and confirmed by the sensory analysis of milk and derived products, leading to a more complete characterization of milk biology and derived products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While imposing a considerable socio-economic burden worldwide, IVD degeneration is also severely impacting on the quality of life of affected individuals. Cell-based regenerative medicine approaches have moved into clinical trials, yet IVD cell identities in the mature disc remain to be fully elucidated and tissue heterogeneity exists, requiring a better characterization of IVD cells. The bovine coccygeal IVD is an accepted research model to study IVD mechano-biology and disc homeostasis. Recently, we identified novel IVD biomarkers in the outer annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) of the mature bovine coccygeal IVD through RNA in situ hybridization (AP-RISH) and z-proportion test. Here we follow up on Lam1, Thy1, Gli1, Gli3, Noto, Ptprc, Scx, Sox2 and Zscan10 with fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization (FL-RISH) and confocal microscopy. This permits sub-cellular transcript localization and the addition of quantitative single-cell derived values of mRNA expression levels to our previous analysis. Lastly, we used a Gaussian mixture modeling approach for the exploratory analysis of IVD cells. This work complements our earlier cell population proportion-based study, confirms the previously proposed biomarkers and indicates even further heterogeneity of cells in the outer AF and NP of a mature IVD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Effect on Adiposity and Milk Fat Synthesis.</Title>	<Abstract>Background: In a prior experiment, treatment of goats with the putative PPAR&#947; agonist 2,4-thiazolidinedione (2,4-TZD) did not affect milk fat or expression of milk-fat related genes. The lack of response was possibly due to deficiency of vitamin A and/or a poor body condition of the animals. In the present experiment, we tested the hypothesis that PPAR&#947; activation affects milk fat synthesis in goats with a good body condition and receiving adequate levels of vitamin A. Methods: Lactating goats receiving a diet that met NRC requirements, including vitamin A, were injected with 8 mg/kg BW of 2,4-TZD (n = 6) or saline (n = 6; CTR) daily for 26 days. Blood metabolic profiling and milk yield and components were measured including fatty acid profile. Expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism was measured in adipose tissue and in mammary epithelial cells (MEC). Size of adipocytes was assessed by histological analysis. Results: NEFA, BHBA, and fatty acids available in plasma decreased while glucose increased in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR. Size of cells and expression of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism-related genes were larger in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR in adipose tissue. In MEC, expression of SCD1 and desaturation of stearate was lower in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR. Conclusions: Overall data revealed a lack of PPAR&#947; activation by 2,4-TZD and no effect on milk fat synthesis despite a strong anti-lipolysis effect on adipose tissue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Osteosarcomas are rare in humans, but occur more commonly in dogs. A comparative approach to studying osteosarcoma has highlighted many clinical and biologic aspects of the disease that are similar between dogs and humans; however, important species-specific differences are becoming increasingly recognized. In this review, we describe risk factors for the development of osteosarcoma in dogs and humans, including height and body size, genetics, and conditions that increase turnover of bone-forming cells, underscoring the concept that stochastic mutational events associated with cellular replication are likely to be the major molecular drivers of this disease. We also discuss adaptive, cancer-protective traits that have evolved in large, long-lived mammals, and how increasing size and longevity in the absence of natural selection can account for the elevated bone cancer risk in modern domestic dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An effective control of Map by either vaccines or chemoprophylaxis is a paramount need for veterinary and possibly human medicine. Given the importance of fatty acids in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids and the mycobacterial cell wall, we tested novel amphiphilic C10 and C18 cyclobutene and cyclobutane fatty acid derivatives for Map inhibition. Microdilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) with 5 or 7 week endpoints were measured in Middlebrook 7H9 base broth media. We compared the Map MIC results with those obtained previously with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Several of the C18 compounds showed moderate efficacy (MICs 392 to 824 &#181;M) against Map, while a higher level of inhibition (MICs 6 to 82 &#181;M) was observed for M. tuberculosis for select analogs from both the C10 and C18 groups. For most of these analogs tested in M. smegmatis, their efficacy decreased in the presence of bovine or human serum albumin. Compound 5 (OA-CB, 1-(octanoic acid-8-yl)-2-octylcyclobutene) was identified as the best chemical lead against Map, which suggests derivatives with better pharmacodynamics may be of interest for evaluation in animal models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been shown that feeding moderate amounts of concentrate during fulltime grazing did not prevent energy shortage and lipomobilization, alterations in energy metabolism, decreasing milk production and loss in body weight. As diet change and energy balance are closely related to immune reactivity, in this trial the effect of transition to pasture on specific immune parameters of cows was documented. Over a 12-week trial 43 dairy cows were observed during transition from confinement to pasture (PG; n = 22) and compared to cows fed TMR indoor (CG; n = 21). The CG stayed on a TMR based ration (35% corn silage, 35% grass silage, 30% concentrate; dry matter (DM) basis), whereas the PG slowly switched to a pasture -based ration (week 0 and 1 = TMR, week 2 = TMR and 3 h pasture&#183;day[-1], week 3 and 4 = TMR and 12 h pasture&#183;day[-1], and week 5 to 11 = pasture combined with 4.5 kg DM concentrate&#183;cow[-1]&#183;day[-1]). Inflammatory markers like blood haptoglobin or tryptophan to kynurenine ratio did not indicate acute phase reaction. Proportions of CD4[+] (T-helper cells) and CD8[+] cells (cytotoxic T-cells) remained uninfluenced as well. White blood cell concentration and its subpopulation of granulocytes increased over time in the PG. Stimulation ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to mount an oxidative burst significantly increased during the trial, too. The endogenous antioxidant state as characterized by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in blood of the PG did not change, whereas the vitamin E concentration reached the highest level at the end of the trial. The 25-CHO metabolites of vitamin D increased as soon as the PG had pasture access, whereas the other metabolite 25-ERG decreased. The results of this study indicate that transition to pasture affects immune related parameters. However, the consequences of the observed effects on health status of the pasture group need to be clarified in further studies with a defined concurrent immune challenge.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One important perturbation is inventory loss due to mortality. In this study, data on 60 lots of approximately 2000 weaned pigs (n = 115,213) from one commercial production system were collected through the wean-to-finish (WTF) cycle with the objective of establishing patterns of mortality, estimating differences in profit/loss among patterns of mortality, and identifying production practices associated with mortality patterns. Information provided by the production system included the number of pigs in each lot at the time of placement (beginning inventory), weaning weight, barn dimensions, number of dead pigs (NDP) daily, capacity placed (proportion pigs actually placed versus what had been planned to be placed) and average weight sold. Analysis of NDP revealed three mortality patterns (clusters I, II, III) composed of 6, 40, and 14 lots, respectively, that differed in the temporal onset and/or level of mortality. Average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated by growth phase for each cluster. An economic model showed profit differences among clusters due to poor biological performance by clusters I and III in the late finishing phase. Cluster II (n = 40) had fewer dead pigs and the highest profit compared to clusters I (n = 6) and III (n = 14). Area per pig (stocking density) was the only factor associated with the differences in mortality patterns. Routine monitoring and the analysis of mortality patterns for associations with production and management factors can help swine producers improve biological performance and improve profit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 2 &#215; 3 &#215; 10 cm, cylindrical to tubular, mottled red-to-tan mass extended from the caudal pelvic cavity caudally and ventrally under the dermis along the caudal aspect of the left pelvic limb adjacent to the semimembranosus and semitendinosus musculature. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a singular central lumen lined by urothelium that multifocally transitioned into non-keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium associated with few hair follicles and sweat glands. The lumen was surrounded by a dense collagenous stroma containing numerous, variably sized blood vessels. The combination of lesions was consistent with a diagnosis of incomplete urethral duplication associated with a dermoid cyst and vascular hamartoma. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an incomplete urethral duplication associated with a dermoid cyst within a vascular hamartoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based upon these findings, we asked if antibiotic therapy alters immune cell populations, as measured by flow cytometry and/or vaccine-specific humoral immunity, as measured by sample to positive (S/P) antibody ratios. Here, we investigated the immuno-modulatory effects of enrofloxacin, ceftiofur, and tulathromycin on the immune response to a Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) combination vaccine in weaned pigs. Maternal antibody likely interfered with the induction of immunity to M. hyopneumoniae. Antibiotic administration did not affect immune cell populations, as assessed by flow cytometry and did not affect the induction of humoral immunity to PCV-2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study investigated the frequency, risk, and prognostic factors of MCTs in dogs admitted to a single veterinary teaching hospital (VTH). Breed, age, sex, and sexual status in ninety-eight dogs with MCTs (MCT-group) were compared with a control group of 13,077 dogs (VTH-group) obtained from the VTH clinical database from January 2010 to January 2016. Within the MCT-group, signalment, location, size, mass number, ulceration, histopathological grading, presence of lymph node, or distant metastases were compared with each other and with the outcome. Boxers (OR 7.2), American Pit Bull Terriers (OR 5.4), French Bulldogs (OR 4.4) and Labrador Retrievers (OR 2.6) were overrepresented. The MCT-group was significantly older than the VTH-group (p &lt; 0.0001). In comparison with the VTH group, in the MCT-group neutered dogs (OR 2.1) and spayed females (OR 2.3) were predominant compared to intact dogs and intact females, respectively. Ulceration (OR 5.2) and lymph node metastasis (OR 7.1) occurred more frequently in larger MCTs. Both ulceration and MCTs &gt; 3 cm were highly associated with lymph node metastasis (OR 24.8). Recurrence was associated with MCT-related death (OR 10.50, p = 0.0040), and the latter was associated with shorter survival times (p = 0.0115). Dogs with MCTs &gt; 3 cm (p = 0.0040), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0234), or elevated WHO stage (p = 0.0158) had shorter survival times. A significantly higher frequency of MCTs was found in specific breeds, and in older and neutered dogs. MCTs &gt; 3 cm and lymph node or distant metastases were associated with shorter survival times.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Response to Intra-Mammary Infection.</Title>	<Abstract>In a prior experiment, treatment of goats with the putative PPAR&#947; agonist 2,4-thiazolidinedione (2,4-TZD) ameliorated the response to intramammary infection without evidence of PPAR&#947; activation. The lack of PPAR&#947; activation was possibly due to deficiency of vitamin A and/or a poor body condition of the animals. Therefore, the present study hypothesized that activation of PPAR&#947; by 2,4-TZD in goats supplemented with adequate amounts of vitamin A can improve the response to sub-clinical mastitis. Lactating goats receiving a diet that met National Research Council requirements, including vitamin A, were injected with 8 mg/kg BW of 2,4-TZD (n = 6) or saline (n = 6; control (CTR)) daily. Two weeks into treatment, all goats received Streptococcus uberis (IMI) in the right mammary gland. Blood biomarkers of metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative status plus leukocytes phagocytosis were measured. Mammary epithelial cells (MEC) and macrophages were isolated from milk and liver tissue collected for gene expression analysis. Milk fat was maintained by treatment with 2,4-TZD, but decreased in CTR, after IMI. Haptoglobin was increased after IMI only in 2,4-TZD without any effect on negative acute phase proteins, indicating an improved liver function. 2,4-TZD vs. CTR had a greater amount of globulin. The expression of inflammation-related genes was increased by IMI in both macrophages and MEC. Except for decreasing expression of SCD1 in MEC, 2,4-TZD did not affect the expression of measured genes. Results confirmed the successful induction of sub-clinical mastitis but did not confirm the positive effect of 2,4-TZD on the response to IMI in well-fed goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>31212682</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Nutrigenomic Effect of Saturated and Unsaturated Long Chain Fatty Acids on Lipid-Related Genes in Goat Mammary Epithelial Cells: What Is the Role of PPAR&#947;?</Title>	<Abstract>A prior study in bovine mammary (MACT) cells indicated that long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) C16:0 and C18:0, but not unsaturated LCFA, control transcription of milk fat-related genes partly via the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;). However, in that study, the activation of PPAR&#947; by LCFA was not demonstrated but only inferred. Prior data support a lower response of PPAR&#947; to agonists in goat mammary cells compared to bovine mammary cells. The present study aimed to examine the hypothesis that LCFA alter the mRNA abundance of lipogenic genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) at least in part via PPAR&#947;. Triplicate cultures of GMEC were treated with a PPAR&#947; agonist (rosiglitazone), a PPAR&#947; inhibitor (GW9662), several LCFA (C16:0, C18:0, t10,c12-CLA, DHA, and EPA), or a combination of GW9662 with each LCFA. Transcription of 28 genes involved in milk fat synthesis was measured using RT-qPCR. The data indicated that a few measured genes were targets of PPAR&#947; in GMEC (SCD1, FASN, and NR1H3) while more genes required a basal activation of PPAR&#947; to be transcribed (e.g., LPIN1, FABP3, LPL, and PPARG). Among the tested LCFA, C16:0 had the strongest effect on upregulating transcription of measured genes followed by C18:0; however, for the latter most of the effect was via the activation of PPAR&#947;. Unsaturated LCFA downregulated transcription of measured genes, with a lesser effect by t10,c12-CLA and a stronger effect by DHA and EPA; however, a basal activation of PPAR&#947; was essential for the effect of t10,c12-CLA while the activation of PPAR&#947; blocked the effect of DHA. The transcriptomic effect of EPA was independent from the activation of PPAR&#947;. Data from the present study suggest that saturated LCFA, especially C18:0, can modulate milk fat synthesis partly via PPAR&#947; in goats. The nutrigenomic effect of C16:0 is not via PPAR&#947; but likely via unknown transcription factor(s) while PPAR&#947; plays an indirect role on the nutrigenomic effect of polyunsaturated LCFA (PUFA) on milk fat related genes, particularly for CLA (permitting effect) and DHA (blocking effect).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31216766</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Mycotoxin Detection in Maize, Commercial Feed, and Raw Dairy Milk Samples from Assiut City, Egypt.</Title>	<Abstract>This survey was conducted to investigate the contamination by multiple mycotoxins, aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2), ochratoxin A (OTA), and zearalenone (ZEA) in 61 samples of maize and 17 commercial animal feed samples, and of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in raw dairy milk samples (n = 20) collected from Assiut City in Upper Egypt. Multi-mycotoxin immunoaffinity columns were used for samples cleanup and mycotoxin purification. An HPLC-FLD system with an on-line post-column photochemical derivatization was used for the detection of the target toxins. AFB1 was detected in both maize (n = 15) and feed (n = 8), with only one maize sample presenting a concentration above the maximum permissible level set by the Egyptian authorities. AFB2 was observed in six maize samples and in one feed sample, with a maximum value of 0.5 &#956;g/kg. ZEA was detected only in feed samples (n = 4), with a maximum value of 3.5 &#956;g/kg, while OTA, AFG1, and AFG2 were under the limits of detection. For milk, all the analyzed samples (100%) were contaminated with AFM1, and 14 samples (70%) presented concentrations above the maximum permissible level in the European Union (EU) (0.05 &#956;g/kg). The concentrations ranged from 0.02 &#956;g/kg to 0.19 &#956;g/kg, except that of one sample, which was under the limit of quantification. The contamination rates in maize and animal feeds are not alarming. In contrast, the consumption of dairy milk samples in Assiut City may pose public health hazards, as AFM1 levels were found to exceed the international permissible limits. Further surveys are highly recommended in order to establish a database for mycotoxin occurrence in Egypt to minimize the possible health risks in animals and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Analyzed herds were representative for location and herd size of dairy goat herds in the Netherlands. A significantly higher proportion of the analyzed 49 herds were organic as compared with the total Dutch dairy goat population. First, the MAP ELISA was optimized using 992 paired serum and milk samples. At a cut-off of 25 S/P%, the relative sensitivity (Se) was 58.4% (n = 992, 95% CI: 48.8%-67.6%) and relative specificity (Sp) was 98.5% (n = 992, 95% CI: 97.5%-99.2%), as compared to serum ELISA results. The percentage of positively tested herds was 78.2% (n = 49, 95% CI: 63.4%-88.1%). The percentage of positive milk samples per herd (n = 22) was on average 4.6% (median, min, and max of 4.7%, 0.0%, and 10.7%, respectively). Average age of ELISA-positive (3.2 years) and -negative goats (3.2 years) was not different. Significantly more vaccinated goats tested positive (6.7%) as compared with nonvaccinated goats (1.1%). This study shows that a high number of vaccinated and nonvaccinated commercial dairy goat herds in the Netherlands have MAP-ELISA-positive goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Species that infect ruminants include M. bovis and M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP is the causative agent of Johne's disease in ruminants, which is a chronic granulomatous enteric infection that leads to severe economic losses worldwide. Characteristic of MAP infection is the long, latent phase in which intermittent shedding can take place, while diagnostic tests are unable to reliably detect an infection in this stage. This leads to unnoticed dissemination within herds and the presence of many undetected, silent carriers, which makes the eradication of Johne's disease difficult. To improve the control of MAP infection, research is aimed at improving early diagnosis. Transcriptomic approaches can be applied to characterize host-pathogen interactions during infection, and to develop novel biomarkers using transcriptional profiles. Studies have focused on the identification of specific RNAs that are expressed in different infection stages, which will assist in the development and clinical implementation of early diagnostic tests.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On abdominal ultrasound, the urinary bladder was observed to have a preserved anatomical position and a hyperechoic mass. The mass measured approximately 1.5 cm, was irregular, and arose from the mucosa of the bladder wall. Due to the evidence of a primary tumor in the urinary bladder, we conducted a partial cystectomy with a 1.0 cm surgical margin and performed histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The histopathology revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm, characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells with moderate nuclear pleomorphism, suggestive of leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the histopathological diagnosis, showing positive staining for vimentin, desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin and negative staining for S100, pan-cytokeratin and MyoD1. We also assessed the proliferative index by Ki67 staining and found that 57% of the neoplastic cells were positive for Ki67. We conducted clinical follow-ups every three months in the first year and every six months thereafter. The patient showed no signs of recurrence after 48 months. The surgery was sufficient to treat the leiomyosarcoma, and adjuvant chemotherapy was not necessary in this case.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Current commercial vaccines contain the first-identified PCV2a's capsid protein or whole virions. Outbreaks of PCVAD, caused by the recently identified PCV2d in vaccinated herds have raised concerns regarding the efficacy of current PCV2a vaccines against PCV2d. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a two-dose regimen for the recently reformulated Fostera PCV MetaStim vaccine, to determine if reformulation with the squalene oil adjuvant and two-dose regimen improves the threshold of protection enough to eliminate viremia in a vaccination and challenge model. Two groups of seven pigs each were vaccinated with the commercial vaccine or PBS, and challenged with the PCV2d virus. Strong pre-challenge virus neutralizing responses were detected against all three genotypes. Post-challenge viremia was not completely eliminated as expected but a 2 log10 mean reduction in viral load was achieved in vaccinated pigs. Vaccinated pigs had a mean score of 0 for pathological evaluation, while unvaccinated pigs had a score of 6.6. In conclusion, the reformulated Fostera PCV MetaStim PCV2a-based vaccine provided significant heterologous protection and was effective against PCV2d.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the Netherlands, 75% herd level prevalence of caprine paratuberculosis has been estimated, and vaccination is the principal control strategy applied. Most goat dairy farms with endemic paratuberculosis systematically vaccinate goat kids in the first months of life with a commercially available whole cell MAP vaccine. We hypothesized that the development of adaptive immune responses in goats vaccinated at young age depends on the environment they are raised in, and this has implications for the application of immune diagnostic tests in vaccinated dairy goats. We evaluated the early immune response to vaccination in young goat kids sourced from a MAP unsuspected non-vaccinated herd and raised in a MAP-free environment. Subsequently we compared these with responses observed in birth year and vaccination matched adult goats raised on farms with endemic paratuberculosis. Results indicated that initial adaptive immune responses to vaccination are limited in a MAP-free environment. In addition, adult antibody positive vaccinated goats raised in a MAP endemic environment are less likely to be IS900 PCR-positive as compared to antibody negative herd mates. We conclude that test-and-cull strategies in a vaccinated herd are currently not feasible using available immune diagnostic tests.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood sera from 4074 animals of both sexes were tested for the presence of anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies, using the indirect, enzyme-linked, immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA). Moreover, to identify the potential risk factors of T. gondii infection, a survey through a breeders' questionnaires was conducted. Nearly one-fourth of the total number of animals tested (1024/4074)-i.e., 25.1%--were seropositive. The seroprevalence in cattle, sheep, and goats was 28.7%, 25.6%, and 11.9%, respectively. The area, sex, age, and herd size were identified as risk factors for T. gondii infection. Higher seropositivity rates were recorded in cows and goats (odds ratio (OR) = 1.63 and 6.4), in old animals (cattle, OR = 2.1; sheep, OR = 1.9; and goat, OR = 3.9), and in small size herds (cattle, OR = 2.5; sheep, OR = 1.9; goat, OR = 2.2). In conclusion, there is widespread T. gondii infection in cattle, sheep, and goats in these two strategic agricultural areas. The identification of the risk factors determines the type of measures and strategies to be undertaken to reduce, control, and prevent T. gondii infection in domestic animals, and thereby reduce human infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, detecting viral infection in animals followed by assessment of the hemagglutinin (HA) subtype of the agent is an indispensable process for risk assessment in pandemic preparedness. In this study, we tested the potential of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a rapid diagnosis method, using a panel of HA subtype antigens. By analyzing reference immune sera, we found that this novel assay could detect HA subtype-specific antibodies without considerable inter-subtypic cross-reactivities, contributing to diagnosis of influenza virus infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the presence of BLV RNA in whole blood from seven asymptomatic cows naturally infected with BLV during one year, including a complete milking cycle and two delivery time points, was investigated by nested-PCR using the oligonucleotides complementary to the tax and pol gene. BLV RNA was detected in four cows at different time points, especially in high blood proviral load cows and around delivery time. This study describes for the first time the detection of free BLV RNA in blood from BLV-infected asymptomatic cows. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of persistent low-level expression of the tax and pol genes that could be a result of viral reactivation, within the asymptomatic period. This finding may be important in the pathogenesis of BLV infection, associated with the delivery period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nevertheless, the procedures for preparation of PRP are currently non-standardized. Several protocols, which are based on distinct centrifugation patterns (rotation speed and time), result in PRPs with different characteristics, concerning platelet and GFs concentrations, as well as platelet activation. The aim of the present study was to compare two different protocols for PRP preparation: protocol (A) that is based on a single-centrifugation step; protocol (B), which included two sequential centrifugation steps (double-centrifugation). The results here reported show that the double-centrifugation protocol resulted in higher platelet concentration, while leukocytes were not concentrated by this procedure. Although platelet activation and aggregation were increased in this protocol in comparison to the single-centrifugation one, the TGF-&#946;1 concentration was also higher. Pearson's correlation coefficients gave a significant, positive correlation between the platelet counts and TGF-&#946;1 concentration. In conclusion, although the double-centrifugation protocol caused premature platelet aggregation, it seems to be an effective method for preparation of PRP with high platelet and TGF-&#946;1 concentrations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This infrequent and rare congenital condition has been described in several species of mammals. Dextorcardia is a series of conditions associated with an abnormal congenital positioning of the heart, and is often associated with situs inversus totalis. Here we report a case of situs inversus totalis and two cases of dextrocardia identified in Sprague Dawley rats during gross necropsy evaluations at both the Health Sciences North Research Institute (HSNRI) in Canada and Finlay Institute of Vaccine Research and Production in Cuba. The intent of this report is to share our findings and aid in the accumulation of data on these rare conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory and humoral responses and adverse reactions induced by three adjuvanted commercial vaccines against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). Holstein heifers (n = 35) were divided into four groups by adjuvant compounds: Vaccine A (Alum; n=9), Vaccine B (Oil-in-water; n=10), Vaccine C (Amphigen/Quil A cholesterol and dimethyl-dioctadecyl ammonium (DDA) bromide (QAD; n=10), and Control (n=6). Heifers were assessed at 0 h, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h post-vaccination; serology was evaluated at first dose (D0), booster (D21) and D42. Heifers vaccinated with Vaccine B (p= 0.0001) and C (p= 0.0001) had a more intense local reaction, while there was a higher rectal temperature detected in heifers vaccinated with Vaccine C (p= 0.020). There was greater systemic reaction observed for heifers vaccinated with Vaccines B and C at 48h (p= 0.002) after a second dose. Clinical pathology parameters [white blood count (WBC) (p = 0.001), neutrophils (p = 0.0001) and haptoglobin concentrations (p = 0.0001)] were higher in animals vaccinated with Vaccine C. Neutralizing Abs against BVDV type 1 strains, NADL and Singer, were detected in animals vaccinated with Vaccines A or C at D42, while BVDV-2 antibodies were detected only in animals vaccinated with Vaccine C. A BHV-1 antibody was detected in all three vaccine groups (Vaccines A, B or C) at day 42 (21 days post booster vaccination). The findings of this research were based on three different commercial laboratory formulations and also according to the conditions which the study was conducted. In this context, vaccine containing mineral oil or Amphigen/QAD presented greater local reactivity and induced a significant systemic inflammatory response. Vaccinated heifers with Alum and Amphigen/QAD commercial vaccines enhanced humoral immune response against BVDV and BHV-1.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31480326</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Pathological Study on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Silicotic Lung Lesions in Rat.</Title>	<Abstract>Silicosis, caused by the inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide or silica, is one of the most severe occupational diseases. Persistent inflammation and progressive massive pulmonary fibrosis are the most common histological changes caused by silicosis. Association of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hyperplastic type II epithelial cells with the fibrotic events of pulmonary fibrosis has been suggested in in vitro silica-exposed cultured cell models, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and bleomycin-induced experimental models. Histological features of EMT, however, are not fully described in silicotic lungs in in vivo. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate EMT of hyperplastic type II epithelial cells in the developmental process of progressive massive pulmonary fibrosis in the lungs of rats exposed to silica. F344 female rats were intratracheally instilled with 20 mg of crystalline silica (Min-U-Sil-5), followed by sacrifice at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after instillation. Fibrosis, characterized by the formation of silicotic nodules, progressive massive fibrosis, and diffuse interstitial fibrosis, was observed in the lungs of the treated rats; the effects of fibrosis intensified in a time-dependent manner. Hyperplasia of the type II epithelial cells, observed in the massive fibrotic lesions, dominated in the lungs of rats at 6 and 12 months after the treatment. Immunohistochemistry of the serial sections of the lung tissues demonstrated positive labeling for cytokeratin, vimentin, and &#945;-smooth muscle actin in spindle cells close to the foci of hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells. Spindle cells, which exhibited features of both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, were also demonstrated with bundles of collagen fibers in the fibrotic lesions, using electron microscopy. Increased expression of TGF-&#946; was shown by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in the lungs of the treated rats. These findings suggested that enhanced TGF-&#946; expression and EMT of hyperplastic type II epithelial cells are involved in the development process of progressive massive pulmonary fibrosis during silicosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eradication of brucellosis has been based on programs that translate into a substantial financial burden for both the authorities and stockbreeders, if not strictly followed. To this end, we sought to create an in vitro cell model that could be utilized as future reference for adequately measuring the number of engulfed brucellae/cell, using peripheral blood-derived sheep macrophages infected with B. melitensis at decimal multiplicities of infection (MOI = 5000-5), to simulate the host cell/microorganism interaction and monitor bacterial loads up to 6 days post-infection. We show that the MOI = 5000 leads to high numbers of engulfed bacteria without affecting macrophages' viability and that the minimum detection limit of our Real-Time PCR assay was 3.97 &#177; 5.58 brucellae/cell. Moreover, we observed a time-associated, significant gradual reduction in bacterial loads from Day 2 to Day 6 post-infection (p = 0.0013), as part of the natural bactericidal properties of macrophages. Overall, the work presented here constitutes a reliable in vitro cell model of Brucella melitensis for research purposes that can be utilized to adequately measure the number of engulfed brucellae/cell and provides insights towards future utilization of molecular biology-based methods for detection of Brucella.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) as compared to robenacoxib in dogs affected by OA. Our hypothesis was that the two compounds would be similar (non-inferiority) in improving mobility. To test this hypothesis, a complete orthopedic examination, x-ray and the Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs (LOAD) survey were performed in dogs affected by OA before and after the treatments. The study was designed as a clinical, randomized, controlled and prospective study. Sixty client-owned dogs were randomized in the R group (n = 30, robenacoxib 1 mg/kg/day for 30 days) and in the UC-II group (n = 30, UC-II 1 tablet/day for 30 days). Thirty days after the beginning of the treatment (T30), the dogs were reassessed for the LOAD, MOBILITY and CLINICAL scores. Based on the data obtained from the study, a significant reduction in LOAD and MOBILITY scores was recorded between T0 and T30 with a similar magnitude among the two groups (R = 31.5%, p &lt; 0.001; UC-II = 32.7%, p = 0.013). The results of this study showed that UC-II and robenacoxib were able to similarly improve mobility of dogs affected by OA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of orally versus subcutaneously administered meloxicam in early-lactation dairy cattle. The study was conducted at a commercial dairy herd in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Twelve postpartum cows were enrolled in the study, receiving either subcutaneous meloxicam (MET) at 0.5 mg/kg body weight (n = 6) or oral meloxicam (MOS) at a higher dose of 1.0 mg/kg body weight (n = 6) immediately following parturition. The predicted half-life (12.5 &#177; 2.0 vs. 28.5 &#177; 2.0 h), Cmax (1.59 &#177; 0.15 vs. 1.95 &#177; 0.16 &#956;g/mL), Tmax (5.33 vs. 11.7 h), and AUC0&#8594;&#8734; (39.6 &#177; 7.4 vs. 115.6 &#177; 19 h * &#181;g/mL) differed significantly between MET and MOS cows, respectively. After controlling for the treatment group, first lactation cows had a significantly higher half-life (4.1 &#177; 2.1 h), Cmax (0.56 &#177; 0.2 &#181;g/mL), and AUC0&#8594;&#8734; (21.6 &#177; h * &#181;g/mL) relative to second lactation or greater cows, respectively.

Cows were fed a control diet with no added lipid, or diets containing OO or HVO (n = 5 cows/group) for 63 days. SAT was obtained from the tail-head area at the onset of the study and after 21, 42, and 63 days of supplementation. Treatments had minor effects on expression of measured genes. Both fat supplements reduced expression of PPARG, HVO decreased transcription of the desaturase FADS2 and lipid droplet formation PLIN2, and OO increased transcription of FABP3. Both lipid treatments decreased expression of the transcription regulator SREBF1 and its chaperone (SCAP) during the first 21 days of treatment. Our data indicated that long-term feeding of OO and HVO have a relatively mild effect on expression of lipogenic genes in SAT of mid-lactating cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Reports of sarcoptic mange in black bears (Ursus americanus) are increasing in multiple states in the USA and while the reason is unknown, mange in other species has been associated with immunosuppression from multiple causes. Serum from bears across Pennsylvania were collected to determine the seroprevalence of five pathogens important for animal and/or human health: Canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus-1 (CAV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Trichinella sp. from bears with sarcoptic mange as well as bears that were clinically normal. Several of these pathogens, particularly canine distemper virus, are associated with immunosuppression and secondary infections in other hosts. In addition to describing the seroprevalence and relating these findings to data from other regions, statistics were performed to determine if antibodies to any of these pathogens were associated with mange in bears. The overall seroprevalence to these pathogens was as follows: CDV 7.1% (17/240), CPV 16% (15/94), CAV 6.9% (6/87), Toxoplasma gondii 64.9% (194/299), and Trichinella spiralis 3.2% (7/220). While there was no association between mange and antibodies to these pathogens, infection with one or more of these pathogens has implications for bears, other wildlife, domestic animal, and human health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 10-year-old dog was trapped with barbed wires, causing an infected wound around its neck and back, which was later diagnosed as severe melioidosis. The dog was treated based on a modified human protocol. Intravenous meropenem injections (20 mg/kg twice daily) were given for 14 days to prevent death from sepsis prior to treatment with oral sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (25 mg/kg twice daily) for 20 weeks to eliminate the bacteria. Canine melioidosis is an unusual infection in dogs, even in Thailand where melioidosis is highly endemic. This successful case management was solely based on proper diagnosis and appropriate treatments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease is characterized by chronic hepatitis, eventually resulting in liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NR) by high hepatic copper levels is an important event in the pathogenesis of liver disease in WD. Intracellular trafficking of ATP7B is mediated by COMMD1 and, in Bedlington terriers, a mutation in the COMMD1 gene results in high hepatic copper levels. Here, we demonstrate a reduced Farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR)-activity in liver biopsies of COMMD1-deficient dogs with copper toxicosis, a unique large animal model of WD. FXR-induced target genes, small heterodimer partner (SHP), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were down-regulated in liver samples from COMMD1-deficient dogs with hepatic copper accumulation. In contrast, the relative mRNA levels of the two CYP-enzymes (reduced by FXR activity) was similar in both groups. These data are in line with the previously observed reduced FXR activity in livers of ATP7B-/- mice and WD patients. Therefore, these data further corroborate on the importance of the COMMD1-deficient dogs as a large animal model for WD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Domestica) and the Influence of Anesthesia with Isoflurane.</Title>	<Abstract>The ventricular filling velocities during diastole and the influence of isoflurane anesthesia on these blood flow velocities of the racing pigeon (n = 43) are evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler sonography. Sonographic examination demonstrates an early passive ventricular (E wave) and late active (A wave) ventricular filling. The results indicate differences between the two heart ventricles. Especially, the E wave velocity of the right heart is significantly lower than in the left heart, which is explained by the crescent-shaped cavity of the right ventricle around the left ventricle. The faster active filling velocities are significantly influenced by heart rate in conscious birds. Anesthesia with isoflurane leads to a significant decrease of the diastolic blood flow velocities, and the A wave velocities of both ventricles are especially influenced. Anesthesia with isoflurane induces a high incidence of insufficiencies of the left atrioventricular valve in the preejection period. These observations indicate that a contraction of the left ventricle myocardium is important for a complete valvular closure and for normal functioning of this heart valve. The effective closure of the right atrioventricular muscle valve in anesthetized pigeons supports the observation of the fast innervation of this muscle valve via a direct connection to the right atrium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Current vaccines delay clinical signs but cannot train the immune system to fully eradicate latent Map. During latency, Map uses host defenses, cage-like macrophage clusters called granuloma, as incubators for months or years. We used an in vitro model to investigate the early coordination of macrophages into granuloma upon Map infection over ten days. We found that at multiplicities of infection (MOI; Map:macrophages) of 1:2 and below, the macrophages readily form clusters and evolve pro-inflammatory cytokines in keeping with a cell-mediated immune response. At higher MOIs, viability of host macrophages is negatively impacted. At 1:4 MOI, we quantified viable Map in our model and confirmed that intracellular Map reproduced over the first five days of infection. Host cells expressed Type 1-specific cytokines, and Map-infected macrophages displayed reduced motility compared to Map-exposed, uninfected macrophages, suggesting an important role for uninfected macrophages in the early aggregative response. Reported is the first in vitro JD granuloma model capturing Map and macrophage viability, size distribution of resulting clusters, motility of monocyte-derived macrophages, and cytokine response during clustering, allowing quantitative analysis of multiple parameters of the Map-specific granulomatous response.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is known that M. bovis strain virulence plays a role in prevalence and spread of the disease, suggesting that strain virulence and prevailing genotypes are associated. However, it is not well understood whether strain virulence correlates with particular genotypes. In this study, we assessed the in vitro intracellular growth of 18 M. bovis isolates in bovine macrophages as an indicator of bacterial virulence and sought a relationship with the genotype identified by spoligotyping. We found 14 different spoligotypes-11 were already known and three spoligotypes had never been reported before. We identified 2 clusters that were phylogenetically related, containing 10 and 6 strains, respectively, and 2 orphan strains. Intracellular growth and phagocytic rates of 18 M. bovis strains were heterogeneous. Our results suggest that M. bovis intracellular growth and phagocytosis are independent of the bacterial lineage identified by spoligotyping.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Capripneumoniae (Mccp). The currently available commercial CCPP competitive ELISA (CCPP cELISA) kit produced and supplied by IDEXX Company (Westbrook, Maine, United States) is relatively expensive for most African laboratories. To address this issue and provide a variety of choices, a sensitive and specific blocking-ELISA (b-ELISA) test to detect antibodies against CCPP was developed. We describe the newly developed CCPP blocking-ELISA based on the blocking of an epitope of a monoclonal antibody (Mccp-25) by a positive serum sample against the Mccp protein coated on a plate. The Percentage Inhibition (PI) cut-off value for the CCPP b-ELISA was set at 50 using 466 CCPP negative and 84 CCPP positive small ruminant sera. Of the negative sera, 307 were obtained from the Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory (BNVL) and 159 from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) Germany. The 84 positive sera samples came from experimentally vaccinated goats at the AU-PANVAC facility in Debre-Zeit, Ethiopia. The relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CCPP b-ELISA was 93% and 88%, respectively. This test result indicated good correlation with that of the commercial CCPP cELISA by IDEXX Company (Westbrook, Maine, United States) with a Cohen's &#954; agreement of &#954; agreement of 0.85. The newly developed CCPP b-ELISA will be useful in the detection of antibodies for the diagnosis CCPP and for sero-surveillance during vaccination campaigns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During a dog's life, the immune system needs to adapt to different physiological conditions, assuring surveillance and protection in a careful and controlled way. Pregnancy alters normal homeostasis, requiring a balance between immunity and tolerance. The embryos and fetus should be protected from infections, while the female dog must tolerate the growing of semi-allografts in her uterus. After birth, newborn puppies are at great risk of developing infectious diseases, because their immune system is in development and immune memory is absent. Passive transfer of immunity through colostrum is fundamental for puppy survival in the first weeks of life, but hampers the development of an active immune response to vaccination. At the end of life, dogs experience a decline in the structure and functional competence of the immune system, compromising the immune responses to novel antigenic challenges, such as infections and vaccines. Therefore, the current article reviews the general processes related to the development of the dog&#180;s immune system, providing an overview of immune activity throughout the dog's life and its implications in canine health, and highlighting priority research goals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For the BTB eradication program in Fiji, there is concern about the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), which is overabundant and in direct contact with cattle. Consequently, a survey of mongooses trapped on three BTB affected dairy farms led to necropsy of 85 mongooses during January-February 2017. Thirty (35%) mongooses had gross pathological changes including possible granulomas detected at necropsy, and tissues from these animals were taken for histopathological examination. Granulomatous lesions were present in 53% of animals examined histopathologically but acid-fast bacilli were not observed and the majority of lesions in lung and kidney were associated with the nematodes Pulmostrongylus herpestis and Capillaria sp., respectively. Nevertheless, assuming test sensitivity of 35% for the current study, from this sample of 85 mongooses it can be concluded with 95% confidence that if present in the mongoose population susceptible to trapping, M. bovis prevalence was &#8804;10%. The prevalence of intercurrent lesions raised concerns about gross pathology as a screening test for M. bovis infection in mongooses in Fiji, and therefore pathogen detection methods such as bacterial culture and direct tissue PCR are recommended for future surveys. These are needed to completely rule out the mongoose as a reservoir host for M. bovis in Fiji.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These mammals have the potential to be domesticated. The animals included three rodents, agouti (Dasyprocta leporina), lappe (Agouti paca), and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris); a marsupial, manicou (Didelphis marsupialis insularis); and an artiodactyl, the collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu/Peccari tajacu) and a ruminant (the red brocket deer, Mazama americana). While there are many descriptions of the parasites present, the majority of publications failed to note the effect of them on the animals. Most information is available on endoparasites of capybara, while the endoparasites of the red brocket deer were the least reported. The manicou was reported to have had the most number of endoparasites, 44 species of parasites were reported, while there were only 24 endoparasites reported in the lappe. The most common parasites found in these neotropical animals were Paraspidodera uncinata, Strongyloides spp., Eimeria spp., Moniezia benedeni, Trichuris spp., Physocephalus spp., and Giardia spp. A large majority of the studies concluded that these animals were reservoirs for parasites that could affect domesticated livestock. Endoparasites of zoonotic significance were Echinoccocus spp., Trichuris spp., Giardia spp., and Cryptosporidium spp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study is to define the components present in the EtOH extract. We show that this extract is composed of lipid, carbohydrate, and proteins on the surface of the bacilli, and that EtOH removes the outer layer structure of Map which comprise these elements. To identify proteins, polyclonal antibodies to the EtOH prep were produced and used to screen a Map genomic expression library. Seven overlapping clones were identified with a single open reading frame, MAP_0585, common to all. MAP_0585, which encodes a hypothetical protein, was recombinantly produced and used to demonstrate strong reactivity in sera from hyperimmunized rabbits, but this protein is not strongly immunogenic in cattle with Johne's disease. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was used to determine the presence of additional proteins in the EtOH extract. These antibodies demonstrated that a well-known antigen, termed MPB83, is present in M. bovis EtOH extracts and a fatty acid desaturase (MAP_2698c) is present in Map EtOH extracts, while lipoarabinomannan was common to both. The lipid and carbohydrate components of the extract were analyzed using thin layer chromatography and lectin binding, respectively. Lectin biding and protease treatment of the EtOH extract suggest the antigenic component is carbohydrate and not protein. These results give further insight into this important antigen prep for detecting mycobacterial diseases of cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in badgers is important for the development of strategies for the control of the disease. Sensitive serological tests for badger TB are needed for reasons such as cost and simplicity. Assay of mucosal IgA could be useful for diagnosing respiratory pathogens such as Mycobacterium bovis and for monitoring the response to mucosal vaccination. To develop an IgA assay, we purified secretory IgA from badger bile, identifying secretory component (SC), heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC), at 66, 46 and 27 Kda, respectively, on the basis of size comparison with other species. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated to purified IgA. We selected two for ELISA development. The detection limit of the IgA-specific mAbs was found to be approximately 20 ng/mL when titrated against purified badger bile. One monoclonal antibody specific for badger IgA was used to detect IgA in serum and tracheal aspirate with specificity to an immunodominant antigen of M. bovis. An M. bovis infection dose-dependent IgA response was observed in experimentally infected badgers. IgA was also detected by immunohistochemistry in the lungs of bTB-infected badgers. With further characterisation, these represent new reagents for the study of the IgA response in badgers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Interest in the subchondral bone has grown, as it is now considered a key element in the osteochondral defect healing. The aim of this work was to generate and to evaluate the architecture of three cell-free scaffolds made of collagen, magnesium/hydroxyapatite and collagen hydroxyapatite/wollastonite to be implanted in a sheep animal model. Scaffolds were designed in a bilayer configuration and a novel "Honey" configuration, where columns of hydroxyapatite were inserted within the collagen matrix. The use of different types of scaffolds allowed us to identify the best scaffold in terms of integration and tissue regeneration. The animals included were divided into four groups: three were treated using different types of scaffold while one was left untreated and represented the control group. Evaluations were made at 3 months through CT analysis. The novel "Honey" configuration of the scaffold with hydroxyapatite seems to allow for a better reparative process, although we are still far from obtaining a complete restoration of the defect at this time point of follow-up.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bungowannah pestivirus (BuPV; new species Pestivirus F) causes sudden death in young pigs, but has only ever been isolated in the Australian region Bungowannah. Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV; new species Pestivirus K) on the other hand has been found in multiple countries worldwide and is potentially linked to congenital tremor, a disease that causes considerable production problems in pig farms. To assess the seroprevalences of both viruses in German commercial farms during the years 2009/10 and 2018, two approaches were selected. Antibodies against Pestivirus F were detected by a traditional in-house indirect immunofluorescence test against the culture-grown virus isolate, while for the detection of Pestivirus K-specific antibodies, a newly developed test system utilizing a chimeric construct of bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1; species Pestivirus A) containing the E1 and E2 encoding sequences of APPV was established. A total of 1115 samples originating from 122 farms located in seven German federal states were investigated. Antibodies against Bungowannah virus could not be detected, confirming the absence of this virus in other regions than the initially affected Australian pig farm complex. In contrast, antibodies against APPV were highly prevalent throughout Germany at both investigated time points. The seroprevalence at the state level fluctuated to some degree, but the overall percentage remained stable, as is to be expected for an endemic pestivirus lacking any form of control measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Brazil, there have been no previous published reports on the presence of field REV alone or in coinfection. This retrospective study analyzes samples from a case of lymphoproliferative lesions from a backyard chicken flock. MDV and REV were detected by PCR and classified as MDV1 and REV3, respectively, through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis based on the glycoprotein B (gB) genes for MDV and the polymerase (pol) and envelope (env) genes for REV. Real-time PCR reactions were performed for MDV to rule out the presence of the Rispens vaccine strain. This is the first report of the presence of REV in coinfection with a MDV clinical case in Brazil and the first molecular characterization of REV in South America. This study highlights the importance of molecular diagnosis for REV and MDV in poultry. In addition, this study highlights the distribution of these two viruses worldwide and the latent risk of them solely or in coinfection to this part of the world.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Little is known about the impacts of feeding colostrum and supplemental vitamins on the gut microbiome in calves exposed to MAP. In the present study, calves were assigned at birth to one of six treatment groups: (1) Colostrum deprived (CD), no vitamins; (2) colostrum replacer (CR), no vitamins; (3) CR, vitamin A; (4) CR, vitamin D3; (5) CR, vitamin E; (6) CR, vitamins A, D3, E, with five calves per treatment in a 14-day study. All calves were orally inoculated with MAP on days 1 and 3 of the study. Differences due to vitamin supplementation were not significant but treatment groups CR-A, CR-E, and CR-ADE had higher numbers of MAP-positive tissues overall. Shannon diversity indices demonstrated regional differences in microbial communities, primarily Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, between the ileum, cecum, and spiral colon of all calves. CD calves exhibited increased richness compared with CR calves in the cecum and spiral colon and harbored increased Proteobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes in the mucosa compared with the lumen for all three tissues. Overall, supplementation with vitamins did not appear to influence gut microbiome or impact MAP infection. Feeding of colostrum influenced gut microbiome and resulted in fewer incidences of dysbiosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Available direct diagnostic tests aimed at detecting the pathogen are highly specific but lack sensitivity, depending on the stage of infection and the prevalence of infection in a population. The sensitivity of indirect diagnostic assays that measure the host immune response to infection is similarly affected by disease characteristics. The choice of antigen used to detect a host response to infection has a critical impact on test sensitivity and specificity. Many indirect tests rely on crude antigen preparations and cell-free extracts, of which the production is poorly standardized. Moreover, these preparations contain ample uncharacterized cross-reactive compounds. To enhance serological test specificity, existing assays depend on the pre-treatment of samples and a relatively high cut-off value, that in turn influences test sensitivity. Research therefore focuses on the identification of more specific, defined antigens to improve diagnostics. In the current study, we extracted phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and investigated their potential use in antibody-based tests. Our results demonstrate that specific IgG class antibodies are generated against PIMs in cows, but this is unrelated to tuberculosis or paratuberculosis infection status, making these antigens unsuitable for diagnostic applications. In addition, we demonstrate that PIMs are widely present in crude antigen preparations and in serum pre-absorption buffer. Our results indicate that PIMs are cross-reactive compounds with immunodominant B cell epitopes that could impair serological test specificity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As an effective vaccine is lacking, strict application of control measures is the only way to fight the disease in both industrial farms and backyard holdings. With generally low biosecurity standards, the latter are at particular risk for disease introduction and offer challenging conditions for disease control. In the following case report, we describe the overall course of an ASF outbreak in a Bulgarian backyard farm and the implemented control measures. Farm facilities and available data have been investigated to estimate the possible source, spread and time point of virus introduction. Contact with contaminated fomites entering the stable via human activities was regarded to be the most likely introduction route. The slow disease spread within the farm contributes to the hypothesis of a moderate contagiosity. As no further ASF outbreaks have been detected in domestic pig farms in the region, it could be demonstrated that successful disease control in small-scale farms can be reached. Thus, the report contributes to a better understanding of ASF in the backyard sector.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As professional antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) play a unique role in innate immunity. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with PPRV. Results: Transcriptional profiling was performed using RNA sequencing. Herein, we reported that compared to untreatedBMDCs, 4492 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified following PPRV stimulation, out of these DEGs 2311 were upregulated and 2181 were downregulated, respectively. A total of three gene ontology (GO) term clusters of biological process, cell component and molecular function were significantly enriched in 963 GO terms in the PPRV-stimulated BMDCs. These GO clusters were related to inflammatory response, cell division and vacuole, anchoring junction, positive regulation of cellular component and nucleoside binding. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of DEGs were enriched in a chemokine signaling pathway, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, cell cycle and mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, identified DEGs of BMDCs were further validated by qRT-PCR and the results were in accordance with the change of the genes. This study suggested the effects of PPRV stimulation on the maturation and function of BMDCs. Conclusion: We found that the dramatic BMDCs transcriptome changes triggered were predominantly related to an inflammatory response and chemokine signaling pathway.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, there are concerns about a potential zoonotic risk. Therefore the industry's objectives are to decrease MAP prevalence, limit economic losses as well as reduce the concentration of MAP in (bulk) milk. To diminish within-farm spread of infection, vaccination, age dependent group housing with separation of newborns from adults, as well as rearing on artificial or treated colostrum and milk replacers are implemented. However, the importance of MAP contaminated colostrum and milk as a route of infection in dairy goat herds is unknown. Therefore the aim of this study was to detect the presence of MAP DNA in colostrum and milk from dairy goats in infected herds. A convenience sample of 120 colostrum samples and 202 milk samples from MAP infected dairy goat herds were tested by IS900 real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for MAP DNA. Furthermore, 22 colostrum samples and 27 post mortem milk samples of goats with clinical signs consistent with paratuberculosis from known infected herds were tested. The majority of samples were from goats vaccinated against MAP. Positive or doubtful PCR results were obtained in none of the 120 and two of the 22 colostrum samples, and in eight of the 202 and four of the 27 milk samples Negative PCR results were obtained in the remaining 140 (99%) colostrum samples and 217 (95%) milk samples.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

When an animal is first classified as an inconclusive reactor (IR) using this test, it is not subject to compulsory slaughter, but it must be isolated from the rest of the herd. To understand the risk posed by these animals, a case-control study was conducted to measure the association between IR status of animals and the odds of them becoming a reactor to the SICCT at a subsequent test. The study included all animals from herds in which only IR animals were found at the first whole herd test in 2012 and used data from subsequent tests up until the end of 2016. Separate mixed-effects logistic regression models were developed to examine the relationship between IR status and subsequent reactor status for each risk area of England and for Wales, adjusting for other explanatory variables. The odds of an animal becoming a subsequent reactor during the study period were greater for IR animals than for negative animals in the high-risk area (odds ratio (OR): 6.85 (5.98-7.86)) and edge area (OR: 8.79 (5.92-13.04)) of England and in Wales (OR: 6.87 (5.75-8.22)). In the low-risk area of England, the odds were 23 times greater, although the confidence interval around this estimate was larger due to the smaller sample size (11-48, p &lt; 0.001). These findings support the need to explore differential controls for IR animals to reduce the spread of TB, and they highlight the importance of area-specific policies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Methods-Ten naturally infested dogs received one drop per affected site on day (D) 0, and on D14, the rest of the pipette was applied on the skin between the shoulders. Five dogs served as sentinels. Parasite score (0-3), skin lesions (0-4), and investigator pruritus scale (0-4) were assessed on D0, D1, D14, and D28. Results-No treated dogs developed adverse reactions. Parasite score of sentinel dogs was maintained between 1.8 (D0, D1, and D28) and 2.2 (D14). In treated dogs, D0 parasite score was 2.4. It was significantly reduced from D1 (0.5; p &lt; 0.002) to D28 (0.1; p &lt; 0.002). The lesion score was 2.9 on D0 and D1; it was significantly reduced on D14 (0.6; p &lt; 0.002) and D28 (0.1; p &lt; 0.002). Similarly, investigator pruritus scale (D0, 2.2) scores significantly decreased on D14 (0.4; p &lt; 0.004) and D28 (0.2; p &lt; 0.002). Conclusions-The combination permethrin-fipronil appears to be well-tolerated, rapidly and durably effective in the control of localized canine harvest mite infestation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mammary tumors are the most common type of cancer in intact female dogs and account for about half of all neoplasms in these dogs. Well-established models of breast cancer have shown that neoplastic cells often have a loss of intercellular communication, particularly gap junction proteins. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the aspect of gap junction intercellular communication in canine mammary carcinoma, non-cancerous (CMEC) and cancerous (CMT12, CMT27, and CF41.Mg) cells, and patient-derived tumors. Both non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells express connexins 26 and 43 using immunofluorescence; however, the level of expression is significantly different in quantitative analysis using western blot in which connexin 43 in both CMT12 and CMT27 is significantly decreased compared to CMEC. Furthermore, a decrease of gap junction capacity in CMT12 and CMT27 was observed compared to CMEC. Immunostaining of CMT27-xenograft tumors revealed positive Cx26 and negative Cx43 expression. Similarly, immunostaining of spontaneous canine mammary tumors revealed that Cx26 is present in all tumors while Cx43 is present in 25% of tumors. Overall, the study provides for the first time that a differential pattern of connexin expression exists between non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells in dogs. This study will pave the path for further in vitro work of connexins in comparative canine models and possibly allow for novel therapeutics to be developed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At approximately 4 days of age, calves had one of four treatments assigned to each horn bud: (1) clove oil administered subcutaneously under the horn bud (CLOV, n = 132); (2) cautery disbudded and the horn bud removed (BUDOFF, n = 126); (3) cautery disbudded and the horn bud tissue left intact (BUDON, n = 129); (4) a liquid nitrogen filled probe applied to the horn bud area (CRYO, n = 131). At approximately 16 months of age, all cattle were checked for scur or horn development. A sub-set of scurs/horns from the CLOV cattle were removed to evaluate tissue and structural development. In total, 5% of CLOV buds developed into horns and 63% into scurs; 10% of the scurs looked like normally developed horns but they were not attached to the skull. Cautery disbudding prevented scur and horn development in cattle when the horn bud tissue was removed, but some scur growth was observed in the BUDON treatment. CRYO was 100% ineffective at preventing scur/horn growth. Injecting clove oil under the horn bud appeared to delay horn development, but not prevent it, when administered to 4 day old dairy calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different etiologies can lead to this result, including spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs) and ulcerative keratitis associated with bullous keratopathy. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutic approaches such as matrix therapy replacement. To determine the efficacy of a new ophthalmic treatment (Clerapliq[&#174;]) for SCCEDs and ulcerative keratitis associated with bullous keratopathy, a total of 11 dogs referred to the clinic because of nonhealing erosive ulcers after a classic primary treatment were enrolled to get this new treatment. Dogs underwent ophthalmic exams and 7 dogs (10 eyes) were diagnosed with superficial ulceration and 4 dogs (5 eyes) with bullous keratopathy due to endothelial dystrophy/degeneration. They received eye drops of Clerapliq[&#174;] every 3 days until recovery. The results showed that the corneas with recurrences of the ulcers were resolved predominantly by using Clerapliq[&#174;] every 3 days in 83.3% of the cases during a period of treatment ranging between 6 to 35 days. Therefore, this new approach using matrix therapy regenerating technology in treating superficial ulcers and bullous keratopathy in dogs can be successfully considered as an adjunctive therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tibial tuberosity fracture/fissure is a complication of TTA that may have a favorable prognosis. The aim of this study was to detect how tibial tuberosity fracture/fissure through the Maquet hole worsens the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in the stifle joint of dogs treated with porous TTA. Seventeen cases were included in the study, divided into two groups. The first group (n = 10) included subjects that had tibial tuberosity fracture/fissure through the Maquet, and the second group included subjects that had no complications (n = 7). Both groups showed significant progression compared to OA at 3 months after surgery. We observed that at T0, the control group showed a higher level of OA. For this reason, we normalized the OA scores, evaluating the percentage difference from T0 and T1. We verified that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The results confirm that OA progression in subjects undergoing TTA was not significantly influenced by fracture/fissure of the tibial tuberosity through the Maquet hole. Therefore, fracture fissure through the Maquet hole should be considered as a common minor complication during TTA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since ASF reached Europe wild boar populations have been a reservoir for the virus. Collecting reliable data on infected individuals in wild populations is challenging, and this makes it difficult to deploy an effective eradication strategy. However, for diseases with high lethality rate, infected carcasses can be used as a proxy for the number of infected individuals at a certain time. Then R0 parameter can be used to estimate the time distribution of the number of newly infected individuals for the outbreak. We estimated R0 for two ASF outbreaks in wild boar, in Czech Republic and Belgium, using the exponential growth method. This allowed us to estimate both R0 and the doubling time (Td) for those infections. The results are R0 = 1.95, Td = 4.39 for Czech Republic and R0 = 1.65, Td = 6.43 for Belgium. We suggest that, if estimated as early as possible, R0 and Td can provide an expected course for the infection against which to compare the actual data collected in the field. This would help to assess if passive surveillance is properly implemented and hence to verify the efficacy of the applied control measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, Escherichia coli, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Bordetella avium are among the most important avian respiratory pathogens. ORT is responsible for causing ornitobacteriosis, a disease characterized by clinical signs ranging from mild to severe respiratory conditions, with high mortality rates, mainly affecting turkeys and chickens. The first report of ornitobacteriosis was in 1981 in Germany. Despite its importance, few studies on ORT have been published. In addition, the presence of this pathogen has been neglected in poultry farms, mainly due to the lack of appropriate diagnostic protocols. The lack of correct isolation and diagnostic protocols along with inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents have been contributing to treatment failure. Due to its economic importance to the poultry industry, ornitobacteriosis should be monitored and included in national programs for the prevention and control of avian respiratory diseases. This review aimed to update and discuss important issues related to ORT since this pathogen has great economic and sanitary implications for the chicken production chain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human medicine, the clinical symptoms of aeromonad infection include not only gastroenteritis but also extraintestinal infections, such as wounds, cellulitis, and septicemia, in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. In this study, ten red-eyed crocodile skinks (Tribolonotus gracilis) that shared the same space were found dead 7 days after being shipped from Indonesia. The necropsy revealed A. hydrophila to be the causative agent, and the isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics, based on an antimicrobial susceptibility test. Seven virulence factors (act, ast, alt, aerA, fla, gcaT, and ahyB) considered to be associated with virulence were detected by PCR. Microscopic examination revealed several necrotic lesions and melano-macrophage centers in the tissue slides. Reptiles caught in the wild for trade experience captivity stress. Furthermore, in the winter, reptiles are easily exposed to the cold atmosphere. These stresses can negatively impact the immunity of these ectotherms, making them vulnerable to A. hydrophila infections. Therefore, to avoid such opportunistic infections and mortality following exposure to severe stress, medical care is recommended. The studies of alternatives, such as bacteriophage and bacteriocin, are needed for a preventive application.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31906007</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluation of the Efficiency of Active and Passive Surveillance in the Detection of African Swine Fever in Wild Boar.</Title>	<Abstract>African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs and has a drastic impact on pig industry. Wild boar populations play the role of ASF genotype II virus epidemiological reservoir. Disease surveillance in wild boar is carried out either by testing all the wild boar found sick or dead for virus detection (passive surveillance) or by testing for virus (and antibodies) all hunted wild boar (active surveillance). When virus prevalence and wild boar density are low as it happens close to eradication, the question on which kind of surveillance is more efficient in detecting the virus is still open. We built a simulation model to mimic the evolution of the host-parasite interaction in the European wild boar and to assess the efficiency of different surveillance strategies. We constructed a deterministic SIR model, which estimated the probability to detect the virus during the 8 years following its introduction, using both passive and active surveillance. Overall, passive surveillance provided a much larger number of ASF detections than active surveillance during the first year. During subsequent years, both active and passive surveillance exhibited a decrease in their probability to detect ASF. Such decrease, though, was more pronounced for passive surveillance. Under the assumption of 50% of carcasses detection, active surveillance became the best detection method when the endemic disease prevalence was lower than 1.5%, when hunting rate was &gt;60% and when population density was lower than 0.1 individuals/km[2]. In such a situation, though, the absolute probability to detect the disease was very low with both methods, and finding almost every carcass is the only way to ensure virus detection. The sensitivity analysis shows that carcass search effort is the sole parameter that increases proportionally the chance of ASF virus detection. Therefore, an effort should be made to promote active search of dead wild boar also in endemic areas, since reporting wild boar carcasses is crucial to understand the epidemiological situation in any of the different phases of ASF infection at any wild boar density.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Current vaccines have shown to be cost-effective control reagents, although they are restricted due to cross-interference with bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Therefore, novel vaccination strategies are needed and this study is focused on evaluating alternative vaccination routes and their effect on the local immune response. The MAP oral challenge rabbit model was used to evaluate and compare an experimental inactivated MAP vaccine through oral (VOR) and intradermal (VID) routes. The VID group presented the highest proportion of animals with no visible lesions and the lowest proportion of animals with MAP positive tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the VID group presented a dominantly M1 polarized response indicating an ability to control MAP infection. In general, all vaccinated groups showed lower calprotectin levels compared to the non-vaccinated challenged group suggesting less active granulomatous lesions. The VID group showed some degree of skin test reactivity, whereas the same vaccine through oral administration was completely negative. These data show that PTB vaccination has an effect on macrophage polarization and that the route influences infection outcome and can also have an impact on bTB diagnosis. Future evaluation of new immunological products against mycobacterial diseases should consider assaying different vaccination routes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three different incision modes were used, i.e., a cold blade, electrosurgery, and the Onemytis[&#174;] plasma scalpel were evaluated histologically to assess invasiveness and tissue injuries at different distances from the cutting surface. The histological examinations showed moderate necrosis caused by Onemytis[&#174;], compared to the use of the more invasive electrosurgery, which induces thermal damage that extends beyond 1000 &#181;m. Our study shows that the use of the plasma scalpel reduces the extension of the thermal lesion on the skin compared to an electrosurgical scalpel.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In December 2017, a swine melioidosis case was discovered during a meat inspection at a privately-owned slaughterhouse in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in southern Thailand. The infection, which continued for several months, caused a dispute about where the disease began. An environmental investigation into two farms-both involved in raising the first infected pig-ensued. Through genetic analysis, the investigation revealed that a contaminated water supply at one farm was the probable source of infection. The three local sequence types identified in the investigation were types 51, 298 and 392.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31948042</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Estimating the Postmortem Interval of Wild Boar Carcasses.</Title>	<Abstract>Knowledge on the postmortem interval (PMI) of wild boar (Sus scrofa) carcasses is crucial in the event of an outbreak of African swine fever in a wild boar population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the decomposition process of this species in different microhabitats is necessary. We describe the decomposition process of carcasses exposed in cages. Trial 1 compared a wild boar and a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) under similar conditions; Trial 2 was performed with three wild boar piglets in the sunlight, shade, or in a wallow, and Trial 3 with two adult wild boar in the sun or shade. The wild boar decomposed more slowly than the domestic pig, which shows that standards derived from forensic studies on domestic pigs are not directly applicable to wild boar. The carcasses exposed to the sun decomposed faster than those in the shade did, and the decomposition of the carcass in the wallow took longest. To assess the state of decomposition, we adapted an existing total body scoring system originally developed for humans. Based on our studies, we propose a checklist tailored to wild boar carcasses found in the field that includes the most important information for a reliable PMI estimation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The broth microdilution method was used for detecting the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 51), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (n = 54), Streptococcus uberis (n = 50), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 85), non-aureus staphylococci (n = 88), Escherichia coli (n = 54) and Klebsiella species (n = 52). Streptococci and staphylococci were tested against cefquinome, cefoperazone, cephapirin, penicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefalexin/kanamycin. Besides cefquinome and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, Gram-negative pathogens were examined for their susceptibility to marbofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The examined S. dysgalactiae isolates exhibited the comparatively lowest MICs. S. uberis and S. agalactiae were inhibited at higher amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cephapirin concentration levels, whereas S. uberis isolates additionally exhibited elevated cefquinome MICs. Most Gram-positive mastitis pathogens were inhibited at higher cloxacillin than oxacillin concentrations. The MICs of Gram-negative pathogens were higher than previously reported, whereby 7.4%, 5.6% and 11.1% of E. coli isolates had MICs above the highest concentrations tested for cefquinome, marbofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. Individual isolates showed MICs at comparatively higher concentrations, leading to the hypothesis that a certain amount of mastitis pathogens on German dairy farms might be resistant to frequently used antimicrobials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31979282</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Biological-Derived Silver Nanoparticles: Preliminary Data.</Title>	<Abstract>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are promising alternatives to antibiotics. The aims of this study were to produce AgNPs using two biological methods and determine their antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. AgNPs were biosynthesized from an infusion of Curcuma longa (turmeric) and the culture supernatant of E. coli. Characterization was achieved by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The antibacterial properties of NPs from C. longa (ClAgNPs) and E. coli (EcAgNPs), alone and in combination with carbenicillin and ampicillin, were investigated through the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Dimensions of NPs ranged from 11.107 &#177; 2.705 nm (ClAgNPs) to 27.282 &#177; 2.68 nm (EcAgNPs). Kirby-Bauer and MIC assays showed great antibacterial abilities for both NPs alone and in combination with antibiotics. EcAgNPs alone showed the most powerful antibacterial activities, resulting in MIC values ranging from 0.438 &#177; 0.18 &#181;M (P. aeruginosa) to 3.75 &#177; 3.65 &#181;M (S. pseudintermedius) compared to those of ClAgNPs: 71.8 &#177; 0 &#181;M (P. aeruginosa) and 143.7 &#177; 0 &#181;M (S. pseudintermedius). The antibiofilm abilities were strain-dependent, but no statistical differences were found between the two NPs. These results suggest the antibacterial potential of AgNPs for the treatment of infectious diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the arthropod fauna of the pig farm environment is currently not well established. Hence, the aim of this study was to clarify the species diversity in pig farms. In total, 22 Diptera species or species groups were found in Estonian pig farms. There were altogether 186,701 individual arthropods collected, from which 96.6% (180,444) belonged to the order of true flies (Insecta: Diptera). The remaining 3.4% were from other insect orders, arachnids, or just damaged and unidentifiable specimens. The activity density and diversity of dipterans differed significantly between 12 sampled farms but not throughout the sampling period. The present study is amongst the few to provide a large-scale overview of pig-farm-associated Diptera in the temperate climate zone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32012730</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Avian Pattern Recognition Receptor Sensing and Signaling.</Title>	<Abstract>Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are a class of immune sensors that play a critical role in detecting and responding to several conserved patterns of microorganisms. As such, they play a major role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and anti-microbial defense. Fundamental knowledge pertaining to the discovery of PRR functions and their ligands continue to advance the understanding of immune system and disease resistance, which led to the rational design and/or application of various PRR ligands as vaccine adjuvants. In addition, the conserved nature of many PRRs throughout the animal kingdom has enabled the utilization of the comparative genomics approach in PRR identification and the study of evolution, structural features, and functions in many animal species including avian. In the present review, we focused on PRR sensing and signaling functions in the avian species, domestic chicken, mallard, and domestic goose. In addition to summarizing recent advances in the understanding of avian PRR functions, the present review utilized a comparative biology approach to identify additional PRRs, whose functions have been well studied in mammalians but await functional characterization in avian.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been the first occurrence of the disease in Eastern EU member states. Since then, the disease spread further affecting not only the Baltic States and Poland but also south-eastern Europe, the Czech Republic and Belgium. The spreading pattern of ASF with its long-distance spread of several hundreds of kilometers on the one hand and the endemic situation in wild boar on the other is far from being understood. By analyzing data of ASF cases in wild boar along with implemented control measures in Lithuania from 2014-2018 this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the disease. In brief, despite huge efforts to eradicate ASF, the disease is now endemic in the Lithuanian wild boar population. About 86% of Lithuanian's territory is affected and over 3225 ASF cases in wild boar have been notified since 2014. The ASF epidemic led to a considerable decline in wild boar hunting bags. Intensified hunting might have reduced the wild boar population but this effect cannot be differentiated from the population decline caused by the disease itself. However, for ASF detection sampling of wild boar found dead supported by financial incentives turned out to be one of the most effective tools.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight Holstein-Friesian cows of proven fertility were employed. After estrous synchronization, at the 18th day of diestrous, the right ovary of each cow was left untreated and served as control while the left ovary was inoculated with 5 mL of PRP. Cows were left to spontaneously return to estrous, and nine days later, a standard superovulation was initiated for every cow. Seven days after artificial insemination (AI), putative embryos were collected by flushing the right and left uterine horns separately. All statistics were calculated by ANOVA. The mean number of follicles, evaluated by transrectal ultrasound scanning, did not statistically differ before PRP treatment between right (control) and left (treated) ovaries (9.18 &#177; 1.35 and 7.32 &#177; 1.67, p = 0.28, respectively) as well as at 48 hours after PRP injection (7.67 &#177; 2.52 and 8.00 &#177; 2.00, p = 0.73, respectively). A statistical (p = 0.023) difference was found in the average number of follicles at the last gonadotropin injection between control and treated ovaries (11.33 &#177; 2.89 and 20.00 &#177; 9.17, respectively). The statistically different (p = 0.0037) number of grade 1-2 blastocysts harvested from the uterine horn ipsilateral to control ovaries in comparison to that collected from the treated ones (6.63 &#177; 2.92 and 14.75 &#177; 5.92, respectively) suggests that intra-ovarian injection of PRP before superovulation could exert beneficial effects both in latent follicle growth and in vivo embryo production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, a variation in terms of distribution and elimination among patients has been hypothesised. The aim of the study was to characterise the pharmacokinetics of medetomidine (0.13 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly (IM) in healthy male cats. Eighteen male cats undergoing castration were included, and medetomidine (0.13 mg/kg) was administered IM. Venous blood samples were collected at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 90 minutes after medetomidine administration. Before orchiectomy, at T20, sperm collection was attempted. Plasma medetomidine concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Semen collection was successful in 15/18 cats. The medetomidine plasma concentration following the IM administration of a bolus was best described using a non-compartment model. Time of maximum concentration was observed at 40 minutes (range 20-90); maximum concentration was 32.8 ng/mL (range 26.8-51.2). The median apparent clearance was 11.9 mL/kg/minute (range 0.7-43.8). In conclusion, medetomidine administered IM at 0.13 mg/kg reached its peak plasma concentration slowly and with variability among patients. In addition, it was characterised by low total body clearance probably due to the cardiovascular alterations associated with medetomidine administration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32046067</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Assessment of Ochratoxin A Exposure in Ornamental and Self-Consumption Backyard Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin that may be present in various food and feed of plant and animal origin, including chicken meat. In Italy, backyard poultry farming is rather widespread. Animals are raised for meat, eggs and for ornamental purpose, and they are often fed with home-made diets not subject to official controls. The purpose of this study was to evaluate exposure of ornamental and backyard chickens to OTA using biliary ochratoxin A as a biomarker. Therefore, bile samples, in addition to kidney, liver and muscle, were collected from 102 chickens reared in 16 farms located in 6 Italian regions. High-performance liquid chromatography method and fluorimetric detection (HPLC-FLD) analysis were carried out firstly on bile from all animals, and OTA was detected in 12 chickens (concentration range 3.83-170.42 &#181;g/L). Subsequently, the kidneys of these chickens were also analysed, and the mycotoxin was not detected. The analytical detection limits (LODs) of OTA in bile and kidney were 2.1 &#181;g/L and 0.1 &#181;g/kg, respectively. In conclusion, these animals were exposed to OTA but their meat can be considered safe, given that this mycotoxin, if present, concentrates highest in kidneys. Biliary ochratoxin A confirms its use as a valid biomarker to assess exposure of poultry to OTA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recently, assessment of the longitudinal right ventricle (RV) strain and strain rate using 2D STE has been reported in dogs. Although longitudinal deformation is the dominant component of the RV systole, RV myocardial fibers of the superficial layer are oriented circumferentially and these contribute to the RV pump function (radial deformation). Because this strain component has not been investigated in dogs, we have assessed radial RV strain and strain rate using 2D STE in healthy dogs and dogs with pulmonary hypertension (PH). We have recruited 74 dogs (40 healthy dogs and 34 dogs with PH) in which we have analyzed radial RV free wall strain and strain rate using Xstrain[TM] software. We have used the left apical 4-chamber view optimized for the RV for analysis of the radial strain and strain rate variables (Xstrain[TM] software denoted radial strain as "transverse"). Seven dogs were excluded during the analysis for low quality images. Transverse strain and strain rate obtained in healthy dogs showed no relationship with heart rate, body weight or age (r[2] &lt; 0.09 and p &gt; 0.05 for all variables). Moreover, no relationship between transverse strain/strain rate variables and left atrial-to-aortic ratios was observed (r[2] &lt; 0.06 and p = 0.2, for both). Transverse strain and strain rate obtained in dogs with PH, showed weak negative relationships with tricuspid regurgitation velocity (r[2] &lt; 0.25 and p = 0.006, for both). Transverse RV strain and strain rate using 2D STE is feasible in most dogs and decrease with worsening of the PH, but these advanced echocardiographic indices do not help in identifying dogs with PH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32050503</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Lab-Made Electronic Nose for Fast Detection of Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of this study is to determine the performance of a lab-made electronic nose (e-nose) composed of an array of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors in the detection and differentiation of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) incubated in trypticsoy broth (TSB) media. Conventionally, the detection of L. monocytogenes and B. cereus is often performed by enzyme link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques require trained operators and expert, expensive reagents and specific containment. In this study, three types of samples, namely, TSB media, L. monocytogenes (serotype 4b American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 13792), and B. cereus (ATCC) 10876, were used for this experiment. Prior to measurement using the e-nose, each bacterium was inoculated in TSB at 1 &#215; 10[3]-10[4] CFU/mL, followed by incubation for 48 h. To evaluate the performance of the e-nose, the measured data were then analyzed with chemometric models, namely linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA), and support vector machine (SVM). As a result, the e-nose coupled with SVM showeda high accuracy of 98% in discriminating between TSB media and L. monocytogenes, and between TSB media and B. cereus. It could be concluded that the lab-made e-nose is able to detect rapidly the presence of bacteria L. monocytogenes and B. cereus on TSB media. For the future, it could be used to identify the presence of L. monocytogenes or B. cereus contamination in the routine and fast assessment of food products in animal quarantine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we investigated the effect of a combination of a high-fiber, highly digestible, hypoallergenic diet with a probiotic mixture in 30 dogs with chronic colitis that were unresponsive to various dietary and/or pharmacological interventions. Fecal scores, canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) scores, the dysbiosis index (DI), and histologic images of colonic biopsies were evaluated. At baseline (day 0; T0) and after 30 days of treatment (T1), all variables evaluated in our patients (i.e., fecal and CCECAI scores and histopathology) improved significantly at T1, with the exception of DI. However, there was a numerical shift from a state of dysbiosis to one of normobiosis. The combination of the diet and the probiotic used in the present study induced the resolution of clinical signs in a mean of 8.5 days (maximum 15 days) and did not necessitate any other treatments or the further addition of alimentary fiber.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since there are no reference values for their size in healthy dogs, the aim of this work was to evaluate the size of the medial iliac lymph nodes by using a ratio with the aortic diameter and find a reference range. The population was divided into group A (healthy dogs) and group B, with diseases of the medial iliac lymph nodes. The ratio of length, height and thickness of the medial iliac lymph nodes with the diameter of the aorta were calculated and underwent statistical analysis, p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Sixty-three patients were enrolled in group A, and 37 in group B. Significant differences were found between the ratio of sick and healthy patients and neoplastic and healthy patients. No significant difference was found between healthy and inflammatory patients. The best cut-off value to discriminate sick and healthy patients was 0.57, with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 71%. The cut-off value of neoplastic and healthy patients was 0.69, with a sensitivity of 89.47% and a specificity of 84.13%.

Ultimately, such innovations are often translated and implemented as best practices across the breadth of biomedical disciplines. Far from novel, competency-based approaches to higher education have been around since the 1960s. These have their origins in student outcomes-based models that focus on the assessment of demonstrated competencies through students' applications of theory, learned in the classroom, to perform a task and/or resolve a defined issue or problem. Despite its long history of contributing to human medical education and, more recently, veterinary medical education, competency-based instruction is still rare in undergraduate biomedical education. Herein, we discuss the value of clinical education in leading the way toward competency-based, undergraduate biomedical programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Following the outbreak confirmation, a state emergency committee was established with representation from municipal authorities and other relevant authorities including the General Authority for Veterinary Services, National Emergency Management Agency, General Agency for Specialized Inspection, and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. The committee provided recommendations and coordinated closely with the State Central Veterinary Laboratory to ensure quick outbreak investigation and response. In addition to outbreak investigations, sampling took place at farms and food premises and suggests a link between the outbreaks and swill feeding practices among backyard pig farmers. Upon government request, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) deployed an expert team to assist in identifying risk factors for the disease spread and provide recommendations as how to improve disease prevention and response. Following the control measures from the involved agencies, the epidemic was successfully controlled and declared over on 11 April 2019. In total, the epidemic affected 83 pig farming households and led to a total of 2862 dead or culled pigs in eleven districts of seven provinces in Mongolia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tear production rate was monitored by means of Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1), and incidence of post-operative corneal abrasions/ulcerations was detected by corneal staining. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed before premedication, at extubation time and 24 h after GA in twenty-five non-brachycephalic dogs (fifty eyes) undergoing elective orthopaedic or spinal surgery procedures. Dogs were randomly allocated to one of three groups receiving as prophylactic LED either carmellose sodium (GC), or 1% hyaluronic acid (GH), or 0.25% hyaluronic acid (GL). In each eye STT-1 was repeated every hour during GA, before instilling one drop of the assigned LED. In all groups STT-1 values drastically decreased during GA, while 24 h later nine eyes (18%) had STT-1 values lower than 15 mm/minute. All of the three formulations tested were fully effective in preventing corneal ulceration (0% in all groups), while 10% of eyes reported superficial de-epithelialization. Fluorescein staining demonstrated that hourly prophylactic LED application prevented exposure keratopathy during general anesthesia in 90% of the eyes in non-brachycephalic dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals-Eight clinically healthy adult large-sized GS dogs (age, 4 &#177; 1.3 years; weight, 38.8 &#177; 4.2 kg). Procedures-A six-camera stereo-photogrammetric system and two force platforms were used for data acquisition. Experimental acquisition sessions consisted of static and gait trials. During gait trials, each dog walked along a 6 m long walkway at self-selected speed and a total of six gait cycles were recorded. Results-Grand mean and standard deviation of ground reaction forces of fore and hind limbs are reported. Spatial-temporal parameters averaged over gait cycles and subjects, their mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variance are analyzed. Joint kinematics for the hip, stifle and tarsal joints and their average range of motion (ROM) values, and their 95% Confidence Interval (CI) values of kinematics curves are reported. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-This study provides normative data of healthy GS dogs to form a preliminary basis in the analysis of the spatial-temporal parameters, kinematics and kinetics during quadrupedal stance posture and gait. Also, a new back movement protocol enabling a multi-segment back model is provided. Results show that the proposed gait analysis protocol may become a useful and objective tool for the evaluation of canine treatment with special focus on the back movement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Various environmental factors influence the decision-making processes of farmers. Deciphering the mental models of farmers allows us to understand the motivations and reasons behind disease prevention and control choices. This study aimed to explore the mental models of cattle farmers in implementing disease prevention and control practices. Using qualitative in-depth, semi-structured interviews, seven cattle farmers from a university's foster farm extension program were sampled. Interview transcripts were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results revealed 23 dimensions comprising the mental model of cattle farmers. The dimensions were conceptualized under four major themes. Farmers were most influenced by perceived risk of disease, perceived effectiveness and benefits of disease prevention and control practices, experience, knowledge and emotions, subjective norms and perceived economic loss. The decision-making processes of farmers are complex and are influenced by various factors. While additional research is needed to confirm the findings using quantitative methods and larger sample sizes, insights gained from the study can be used as inputs to tailor communication and training strategies for improved disease prevention and control interventions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This review article focusses on the role of horses in maintaining the health of humans and the environment. Horses' impact on environmental health includes their influence on soil and the biodiversity of animal and plant species. Nevertheless, the effect of horses is not usually linear and several factors like plant-animal coevolutionary history, climate and animal density play significant roles. The long history of the relationship between horses and humans is shaped by the service of horses in wars or even in mines. Moreover, horses were essential in developing the first antidote to cure diphtheria. Nowadays, horses do have an influential role in animal assisted therapy, in supporting livelihoods in low income countries and as a leisure partner. Horses are of relevance in the spillover of zoonotic and emerging diseases from wildlife to human (e.g., Hendra Virus), and in non-communicable diseases (e.g., post-traumatic osteoarthritis in horses and back pain in horse riders). Furthermore, many risk factors-such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance-threaten the health of both horses and humans. Finally, the horse is a valuable factor in sustaining the health of humans and the environment, and must be incorporated in any roadmap to achieve OH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire among randomly selected residents across 24 study sites. In total, 407 respondents took part in the survey. The majority (367, 92%) were male and had no formal education (270, 66%).Some (118, 29%) believed that rabies does not affect humans. Most respondents (320, 79%) were aware that vaccination could prevent rabies, but nevertheless did not vaccinate their dogs (264, 64.9%) and allowed their dogs to roam freely in search of food. Some (52.8%) would visit traditional healers for treatment in the event of a dog bite incident. Age and educational level were found to be significantly associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices (p&lt;0.05). Although respondents demonstrated some level of knowledge about rabies, overall this study reveals critical gaps in their attitudes and practices. These shortcomings may be associated with a low level of education. Therefore, decision-makers need a new approach to control rabies, with a special focus on public awareness and health education, in order to sustain rabies control programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This case report attempted to provide some insight into dystocia in the agouti which has been rarely reported in animals in captivity. A female agouti weighing approximately 3 kg (kg), which was in the last stage of pregnancy, was found dead in its cage. The vulva of the animal had the hind-limbs of the offspring protruding. Upon necropsy the animal had little fat reserves and had two foetuses in the right horn of the uterus. The feet of on offspring were dislocated and exposed at the level of the vulva. Each foetus weighed approximately 200 g. The foetuses were well formed with fur, teeth and eyes. The placenta was attached to each of the foetuses. The pathological findings suggested that dystocia resulted in secondary uterine inertia, which was the cause of death of the adult female agouti. To prevent the recurrence of this situation the gestation should be staged (timed) using ultrasonography. Animals which are in their third stage of gestation should be monitored using cameras or with personnel at the facility to assist agoutis which are having difficulties at parturition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The S. aureus isolates used for inoculation derived from quarter foremilk samples of mastitis cases. For the examination of the antimicrobial activity, the reduction of the S. aureus germ density was determined [log10 cfu/mL]. The phage mixture consisted of the three obligatory lytic and S. aureus-specific phages STA1.ST29, EB1.ST11 and EB1.ST27 (1:1:1). The selected Lactobacillus plantarum strain with proven antimicrobial properties and the phage mixture were tested against S. aureus in milk, both alone and in combination. The application of the lactic acid bacterium showed only a low reduction ability for a 24 h incubation period. The bacteriophage mixture as well as its combination with the lactic acid bacterium showed high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus for a 24 h incubation period at 37 &#176;C, with only the phage mixture showing significance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data about neoplastic diseases in this species are still sparse and mainly limited to single-case reports. The aim of this study was to present neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative changes in 16/100 pet degus examined at the Veterinary Faculty University of Ljubljana from 2010 to 2015 and to describe the clinic-pathological features of these lesions. Twenty different lesions of the integumentary, musculoskeletal, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems were diagnosed: amongst these were 13 malignant tumors, six benign tumors, and one non-neoplastic lesion. Cutaneous fibrosarcoma was the most common tumor (7/16 degus). It was detected more often in females (6/7 degus) and lesions were located mainly in hind limbs. The gastrointestinal tract was frequently affected, namely with two malignant neoplasms - an intestinal lymphoma and a mesenteric mesothelioma, four benign tumors - two biliary cystadenomas, an oral squamous papilloma and a hepatocellular adenoma, and a single non-neoplastic proliferative lesion. In one animal, two organic systems were involved in neoplastic lesions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted among Australian veterinarians to understand (a) their perceptions regarding the role of MAP in the causation of CD (an ordinal outcome), and (b) their consideration of the adoption of the precautionary principle against Johne's disease (JD; a binary outcome). Ordinal and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of explanatory variables with the above outcomes, respectively. Almost one-third of the respondents (32.2%) considered that MAP was likely to be involved in the causation of CD whereas more than two-thirds (69.8%) agreed with the adoption of the precautionary principle against JD. Veterinarians who were concerned about exposure to and/or getting infected with MAP were more likely to consider MAP as a causative agent of CD (odds ratio: 7.63; 95% CI: 1.55, 37.63) and favor the adoption of the precautionary principle against JD (odds ratio: 6.20; 95% CI: 1.90, 20.25). Those perceiving MAP as a causative agent of CD were also more likely to favor the adoption of the precautionary principle against JD (odds ratio: 13.2; 95% CI: 1.26, 138.90). The results suggest that Australian veterinarians, particularly those who consider MAP as a causative agent of CD are concerned about exposure to MAP and favor the adoption of the precautionary principle against JD. These findings can be useful for animal health authorities for designing JD control programs and policies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to assess the possibility of using circulating serum canine familiaris (cfa) microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel non-invasive serum-based fingerprints for liver injuries associated with various morphologies of extrahepatic and intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (EHPSS and IHPSS). Data were obtained from 12 healthy dogs and 84 dogs confirmed to have EHPSS (splenocaval, splenophrenic, splenoazygos, right gastrocaval (RGC), right gastrocaval with caudal loop (RGC-CL)) and IHPSS (right divisional and left divisional) using CTA. Hepatic pathologies were determined by histopathology. Serum expression of miRNAs was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Based on the nature of liver injuries in each shunt type, cfa-miR-122 was significantly upregulated in all CPSS groups. Meanwhile, serums cfa-miR-34a and 21 were not significantly expressed in splenophrenic or splenoazygos groups, but they were extensively upregulated in splenocaval, RGC, RGC-CL groups and less frequently in right or left divisional groups. Also, serum cfa-miR126 was significantly upregulated in both IHPSS groups but less significantly expressed in RGC, RGC-CL, and splenocaval groups. Overall, estimated cfa-miRNAs could serve as novel biomarkers to mirror the histopathological and molecular events within the liver in each shunt type.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 48 bovine mastitis (BM) milk samples were collected from different parts of the Rangpur division, Bangladesh. After the collection of milk samples, mastitis was confirmed using the California mastitis test. Isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus were performed using conventional cultural and biochemical tests as well as using molecular methods of PCR. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 23S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus was determined. The antibiogram of the isolated bacteria was conducted using the disc diffusion method. Phylogenetic analysis of 23S rRNA was done using MEGA 7, ClustalW multiple sequence alignment, and NCBI-BLAST tools, where the sequence of the isolate showed 98% to 99% identity. Antibiogram test using 15 antimicrobial agents showed that all of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR). It was found that the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, novobiocin, methicillin, vancomycin, and cephradine, and the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin. The detection of MDR-SA in mastitis milk is alarming and represents a great public health concern. The findings of the present study help identify Staphylococcus aureus at the molecular level using 23S rRNA gene sequencing and will help select the appropriate and effective antimicrobial agent to control BM in the northern part of Bangladesh.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

From 2017 to 2018, the T. ovis prevalence in 16,180 sheep and 7560 goats at the Najafabad slaughterhouse in Isfahan was determined. More sheep (477; 2.9%) than goats (90; 1.2%) were found to be infected, and the prevalence was higher in animals &lt;1 y (p &lt; 0.0001), and higher in spring in sheep (8.2%) and goats (2.2%). Female sheep were more frequently infected than males (p &lt; 0.0001); this did not hold true for goats. Of the tissues examined, T. ovis was found more often in the heart muscle of sheep compared with other tissues; however, infections in the heart muscle, masseter muscle, diaphragm, and triceps were similar in goats. Granulomas and caseous necrosis in the heart muscles were associated with the accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells and the formation of fibrous tissue around the parasite. Based solely on infected tissues found in this study, the economic loss caused by the presence of T. ovis larvae was estimated to be 4167 United States dollars (USD). Control methods, such as proper disposal of infected tissues and anthelmintic treatment of infected dogs, are necessary to decrease infection and prevent economic loss in small ruminants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diagnosis of sebaceous adenitis was based on history, clinical signs, the histological demonstration of multifocal lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic inflammation targeting the sebaceous glands and sebaceous glands loss. MGD was diagnosed by non-contact infrared meibography followed by tear film lipid layer interferometric evaluation. Ciclosporin and sebolytic shampoos controlled the dermatological condition, while doxycycline, warm compresses, palpebral massages and tobramycin/dexamethasone ointment controlled the blepharitis. This case report should stimulate clinicians to investigate MGD in dogs suffering from sebaceous adenitis, because the meibomian and sebaceous glands share similar anatomy and physiology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They have been used since ancient times in veterinary dermatology, and a number of studies have focused on investigating the health benefits of some ingredients found in commercially available complementary feed for dogs. The aim of this paper is to review the literature available on the use of nutritional supplementation for the management of canine skin diseases, critically appraising the clinical efficacy of such interventions and summarizing the current state of knowledge. This review highlights how these feeds can be considered useful in the management of dermatological disorders and outlines their beneficial effects in the prevention of dietary deficiencies and treatment of diseases, alone, or in addition to conventional pharmacological therapy. In recent years, nutritional supplements have found increasing potential application in veterinary medicine, and the scientific proofs of their beneficial effects are described in this review.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten (n = 10) dorso/palmar, latero/medial, and oblique views of equine metacarpophalangeal joints affected by osteoarthritis were examined. Nine assessment points were graded (scale: 0-3) twice by five veterinary students (inexperienced group, I) and four equine veterinary surgeons (expert group, E). The grades for each of the nine factors were summed to obtain the osteophytosis score. The variability between the two measurements was -2.04 &#177; 3.5, 95% CI -3.04 to -1.03 for the I group. For the E group, they were 0 &#177; 1.43, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.45. In the evaluation of the same radiographs, the I group had a coefficient of variability (CV) of 37.29%. The correlation was r = 0.90%. The CV between groups was 28.85%. The mean difference between the two observations was -0.03 &#177; 0.29 in the E group and 0.22 &#177; 0.77 in the I group. The I group showed a greater CV when the score was low (r = -0.78) compared to the E group, where the CV was independent of severity of osteophytosis (r = -0.47). The osteophytosis scoring system is an easily applicable and feasible system to be used by observers with different levels of experience, but inexpert observers may need additional training or may need to be helped by reference images. These data are validated by the low inter- and intra-observer measurement variability results in the E group. Therefore, the scoring system proposed seems to be a repeatable instrument applicable to the radiographic score of the severity of metacarpophalangeal joint osteoarthritis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32283846</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Inclusion of Black Cumin Meal Improves Growth Performance of Growing Awassi Lambs.</Title>	<Abstract>Twenty-four Awassi lambs were randomly divided into two dietary treatments to assess the influence of black cumin meal (BCM; Nigella sativa L.) feeding on growth performance. Diets were no BCM (CON) or 150 g BCM/kg DM (BCM150)). Lambs were fed the experimental diets for 80 days. Lambs were housed randomly in individual pens that were fitted with water and feed containers. During the study, nutrient intake was measured daily. Body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) were evaluated biweekly. Nutrient digestibility and nitrogen (N) balance were evaluated on days 49-59. Intakes of dry matter, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ether extract (EE) and metabolizable energy were greater (p &#8804; 0.05) in the BCM150 diet than in the CON diet. The digestibility of DM, CP and EE (p &#8804; 0.04) was improved in the BCM150 diet compared to the CON diet. However, NDF and ADF digestibility did not differ between the two diets. Nitrogen retained (g/d; p = 0.01) and N retention (%; p = 0.05) was greater in the BCM150 compared with CON diet. Final BW, ADG, and feed efficiency (DM intake: kg of gain) was greater (p &#8804; 0.002) in BCM150 lambs than the CON lambs. However, cost/kg of BW gain was lower in the BCM150 diet than in the CON diet. In conclusion, the inclusion of black cumin meal improved the growth performance and profits in diets of growing lambs. Therefore, it could be used as an alternative to soybean meal and barley as a protein and energy supplement, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lung laceration occurred in 46/364 dogs with thoracic trauma (prevalence 12.6%). Dogs with lung laceration were significantly younger than dogs in the control group (median 42 months (interquartile range (IQR) 52.3) and 62 months (IQR 86.1), respectively; p = 0.02). Dogs with lung laceration were significantly heavier than dogs without laceration (median 20.8 kg (IQR 23.3) and median 8.7 kg (IQR 12.4 kg), respectively p &lt; 0.0001). When comparing groups of dogs with thoracic trauma with and without lung laceration, the frequency of high-energy motor vehicle accident trauma was more elevated in dogs with lung laceration than in the control group. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding tge frequency and length of hospitalization and 30-day mortality. Similar to the human classification scheme, four CT patterns are described in dogs in this study: Type 1, large pulmonary laceration located deeply in the pulmonary parenchyma or around an interlobar fissure; Type 2, laceration occurring in the paraspinal lung parenchyma, not associated with vertebral fracture; Type 3, subpleural lung laceration intimately associated with an adjacent rib or vertebral fracture; Type 4, subpleural lesions not associated with rib fractures. Complications were seen in 2/46 dogs and included lung abscess and collapse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of medetomidine on tear flow in rats. Medetomidine in doses of 50, 100, or 200 &#181;g/kg or a physiological saline solution as the control, were administered intramuscularly to male Slc:Wistar/ST rats. After the administration of medetomidine, tear flow in both eyes was measured using a phenol red thread tear test. The area under the curve (AUC) of phenol red thread test values from baseline to 8 h was calculated. Data were plotted against the dose of medetomidine and simple linear regression analysis was performed. The effect of the drug on phenol red thread test values was considered dose-related when linear analysis yielded a significant relationship. In all medetomidine-treated groups, tear flow decreased significantly in both eyes after administration, while no significant changes were observed in either eye in the control group. The AUC values from baseline to 8 h after administration in groups treated with 100 and 200 &#181;g/kg of medetomidine were significantly lower in both the left and right eyes compared to the control group. The linear regression of the AUC values was significant for both eyes. Our results indicated that the intramuscular administration of medetomidine in rats decreased tear flow significantly in a dose-dependent manner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Early diagnosis is of great importance in order to perform an appropriate therapy and to prevent progression towards severe disease. The aim of this study was to compare a point-of-care molecular technique, i.e., the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR), and three serological techniques, i.e., immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a rapid SNAP Leishmania test, to develop an integrated approach for the diagnosis of CanL. Sixty dogs were chosen after physical examination and collection of blood and sera samples, fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes, and conjunctival swabs were performed. Lymphadenopathy (82.3%), as well as clinicopathological alterations of total proteins (70.6%), were the most frequent signs. Forty-one (68.3%) samples resulted positive at least to one technique. IFAT resulted in the best serological diagnostic method (specificity = 100%, sensitivity = 97.2%), detecting a higher number of positive samples than those revealed by other techniques. Among the samples used for molecular analysis, fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes was revealed as the best sample source. LAMP showed a substantial agreement (&#954; = 0.80; p &lt;0.0001) with Rt-PCR; therefore, it could be promising for the rapid diagnosis of CanL. Nevertheless, further studies should be performed to confirm these findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

E. coli were isolated from 50 (37 fish and 13 shellfish) fresh seafood samples and studied with respect to the phenotypic and genotypic characters of antibiotic resistance. Of 475 E. coli isolates from fresh seafood, 71.58% exhibited extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamase (ESBL)-positive phenotypes. A high percentage of isolates were resistant to indicator cephalosporins cefotaxime (95%), cefpodoxime (90.88%) and ceftazidime (90.29%). Relatively higher susceptibilities were recorded against imipenem (74.41%), cefoxitin (66.76%) and meropenem (51.18%). The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 97.35% of the isolates was above 0.18. The ESBL genes blaCTX-M, blaSHV and blaTEM were detected in 62.37%, 23.35% and 2.6% of E. coli isolates, respectively. The ESBL-producing isolates also harboured the metallo-&#946;-lactamase-encoding genes blaOXA (7.06%), blaNDM (4.42%) and blaVIM (0.88%). This study highlights the risk of dissemination of multidrug resistant E. coli in seafood consumer communities and also the need to improve the hygiene of the coastal waters, landing centres and the retail markets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among them, bacterial causes include Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus equuli, Fusobacterium spp. Staphylococcus spp, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Infection can be spread to muscles via haematogenous or extension from skin lesions. Parasitic myositis has also been documented. In this report, a 12 year-old Italian Quarter Horse mare presented with diffuse subcutaneous nodules and masses ranging from 2 &#215; 3 to 5 &#215; 20 cm in size, and adherent to subcutis and muscles that were first macroscopically and cytologically diagnosed as pyogranulomas. Subsequently, histological, molecular, bacteriological, and biochemical investigations were performed. All the data obtained allowed to diagnose a severe and diffuse multibacterial granulomatous myositis caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Corynebacterium amycolatum. Following the therapy and an initial disappearance of most of the lesions together with a general improvement of the mare, the clinical condition deteriorated, and new nodules appeared. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and PCR techniques revealed the presence of bacteria as Glutamicibacter creatinolyticus and Dietzia spp. To the authors' knowledge, this case report represents the first description of multibacterial granulomatous myositis due to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium amycolatum, Glutamicibacter creatinolyticus, and Dietzia spp. in a horse reared in Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this work was to characterize the pathogenic and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of 122 E. coli strains isolated from pigs suffering diarrhea (n = 94) and pigs without diarrhea (n = 28) of 24 farms in Spain. Virulence factors, toxins and AMR (ESBL and colistin) genes and AMR phenotypes of E. coli isolates were analyzed. Low prevalence of pathogenic E. coli strains (26%) was found in both groups. However, ETEC and VTEC strains were more frequently isolated from diarrheic piglets. Irrespectively of diarrhea occurrence, 97.5% of the strains showed a multidrug-resistance (MDR) profile to aminopenicillins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. It was found that 22% of E. coli was CTX-M+, with CTX-M-14 being the principal allelic variant. Remarkably, 81.5% of CTX-M+ strains were isolated from diarrheic animals and presented an extended MDR profile to aminopenicillins, quinolones and aminoglycosides. Finally, low frequencies of colistin resistance genes mcr-1 (4/122) and mcr-4 (1/122) were found. MDR E. coli strains are circulating in pig farms of Spain, representing a serious threat to animal and public health. More appropriate diagnostic approaches (genetic and AMR phenotypic analysis) should be implemented in animal health to optimize antibiotic treatments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We here focus on companion animals, specifically cats and dogs, and evaluate the microbial degradation of mucus and its health impact in the context of the worldwide epidemic of pet obesity. A literature survey revealed that the two presently known Akkermansia spp., A. muciniphila and A. glycaniphila, as well as other members of the phylum of Verrucomicrobia seem to be neither very prevalent nor abundant in the digestive tract of cats and dog. While this may be due to methodological aspects, it suggests that bacteria related to Akkermansia are not the major mucus degraders in these pets and hence other mucus-utilizing taxa may deserve attention. Hence, we will discuss the potential of these endogenous mucus utilizers and dietary interventions to boost these as well as the use of Akkermansia spp. related bacteria or their components as strategies to target feline and canine obesity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we measured the SAA concentration in cats with various diseases and investigated their clinical significance using a primary care hospital as a population. We measured the SAA concentrations in healthy cats (n = 98) and those with various clinical signs (n = 444). The SAA concentrations in healthy cats did not differ significantly by age, breed, sex, and presence/absence of neutering/spaying. The SAA concentrations were significantly higher in the diseased cat group than in the healthy cat group (p &lt; 0.001). We observed significant increases in SAA concentrations in cats with confirmed diagnosis of inflammatory disease such as upper respiratory tract infections (p &lt; 0.001), pneumonia (p &lt; 0.001), pyometra (p = 0.001), and feline infectious peritonitis (p &lt; 0.001), compared with those observed in healthy cats. Conversely, no increase was observed in cardiomyopathy, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus without systemic inflammation. In univariate analysis, survival at 30 days (p = 0.03) differed significantly between the low and high SAA concentration groups, but not at 180 days. In multivariate analysis, survival at 30 days did not significantly affect SAA concentration. Measurement of SAA concentration is a useful biomarker for detecting the presence or absence of inflammation in diseased cats. However, it may not be useful as a biomarker for determining the prognosis of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32331215</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A Comparison of Public Perceptions of Physicians and Veterinarians in the United States.</Title>	<Abstract>Veterinary medicine consists of virtually the same medical specialties as human medicine, with veterinarians performing similar roles as medical doctors, albeit with different species. Despite these similarities, anecdotally, some perceptions of veterinarians as not "real doctors" persist. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare public perceptions of physicians and veterinarians. Participants were provided brief definitions of a physician and a veterinarian and then asked to provide a rating that best describes their perception with respect to 25 different personality characteristics/traits. A sample of 606 participants (unweighted) in the United States completed the survey. The results of this research show that the public tends to perceive veterinarians more favorably than physicians. More specifically, veterinarians were viewed as more approachable, sensitive, sympathetic, patient and understanding, while physicians were viewed as more proud, arrogant and overconfident. These results point to the favorable public perceptions of veterinarians. These findings are particularly relevant for veterinary educators who train the future workforce and have a significant role both in how the profession is portrayed and emphasizing the relationship between the public trust and social responsibility. Reinforcing the public's strong trust in the veterinary profession throughout students' education could enhance their own self-concept, self-esteem and overall mental health and well-being.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32331280</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>HSF3 and Hsp70 Expression during Post-Hatch Cold Stress in Broiler Chickens Subjected to Embryonic Thermal Manipulation.</Title>	<Abstract>Decades of selective breeding for commercial purposes have rendered the broiler chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) highly susceptible to heat and cold stress. A multitude of studies have documented the effects of thermal manipulation (TM) on broiler thermotolerance during periods of post-hatch heat stress, but very few have focused on the effect of TM on a broiler's ability to withstand cold stress. Therefore, the primary objective of the current study is to determine the effects of TM on the acquisition of thermotolerance in broilers via their expression of the stress-associated 70 kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70) gene and heat shock factor 3 (HSF3) gene. Briefly, Hubbard broiler embryos were subject to TM by increasing the incubation temperature to 39 &#176;C and 65% relative humidity (RH) for 18 h daily, from embryonic days (ED) 10 to 18. Broilers were then exposed to cold stress by decreasing the room temperature to 16 &#176;C during post-hatch days 32 to 37. After thermal challenge, broilers were euthanized and hepatic and splenic tissues were collected. Our results showed that TM decreased the hatchability rate and body temperature but improved the body weight gain. TM generally decreased the hepatic expression but did not change the splenic expression of HSF3 during cold stress. In contrast, both hepatic and splenic Hsp70 expression decreased during cold stress. The results of the present study may suggest that TM significantly affects a broiler's genetic response to cold stress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pharmaceutical applications of S-Nitrosylation, which, under normal conditions is involved with a host of epigenetic and embryological development pathways, have exhibited great potential for use as adjuvant therapeutics in the clinical management of cancer. Herein, an evaluation of the impact of nitric oxide (NO) as a potent anticancer agent on murine neuroblastoma cells is presented. Excitingly cell viability, colony formation, and non-carcinogenic cell analysis illustrate the significance and practicality of NO as a cytotoxic anticancer therapeutic. Resazurin, WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt), and MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphyltetrazolium bromide) assays consistently displayed a moderate, ~20-25% reduction in cell viability after exposure to 1 mM S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). A colony formation assay demonstrated that treated cells no longer exhibited colony formation capacity. Identically GSNO-treated Adult Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDFa) exhibited no decrease in viability, indicating potential discrimination between neoplastic and normal cells. Collectively, our findings indicate a potential application for NO as an adjuvant therapeutic in the clinical management of neuroblastoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Possible accepted solutions to cope with the spread of honeybee's pathogens are focused on the study of experimental protocols to enhance the insect's immune defenses. Honeybee's artificial diet capable to stimulate the immune system is a promising field of investigation as ascertained by the introduction of 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans as a dietary supplement. In this work, by collecting faecal samples of honeybees exposed to different dietary conditions of 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans (0.5% and 2% w/w), it has been possible to investigate the Deformed wing virus (DWV) viral load kinetic without harming the insects. Virological data obtained by a one-step TaqMan RT-PCR highlighted the ability of 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans to reduce the viral load at the 24th day of rearing. The results indicated that the diet supplemented with 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans was associated with a dose-dependent activation of phenoloxidase. The control group showed a higher survival rate than the experimental groups. This research confirmed 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans as molecules able to modulate honeybees' defense pathways, and this is the first report in which the kinetic of DWV infection in honeybee faeces has been monitored by a RT-qPCR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32344915</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>In Vitro Inhibiting Effects of Three Fungal Species on Eggs of Donkey Gastrointestinal Strongyles.</Title>	<Abstract>Recently, donkeys have gained popularity mainly due to the use of donkey milk by the cosmetic industry and for human consumption. Gastrointestinal strongyles (GIS) are considered a potential cause of disease and reduced production in infected donkeys. European laws limit the use of anthelmintic drugs for the control of GIS in dairy donkey farms, thus the need to develop alternative control methods. This study aimed to test the in vitro inhibiting effects of three chitin degrading fungi (Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Metarhizium anisopliae, and Beauveria bassiana) on the hatch and viability of donkey GIS eggs by using the egg hatch test, and to compare their activity to that of Pochonia chlamydosporia. About 150 eggs were added to 0.5 mL of sterile saline solution containing about 1.4 &#215; 10[8] spores of each fungal species or with 0.5 mL of sterile saline solution only (untreated controls). After incubation, the percentage of egg hatch reduction was calculated, and data were statistically analyzed. All fungi were able to significantly reduce (p &lt; 0.05) the hatch of GIS eggs compared to the untreated controls. Further studies that aim to investigate the efficiency of these fungi in reducing donkey GIS eggs in contaminated environments are encouraged.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32349228</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in Poultry Species in Algeria: Long-Term Study on Prevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance.</Title>	<Abstract>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a well-known pathogen with a serious impact on human and veterinary public health. To determine antibiotic resistance of MRSA in poultry, 4248 nasal swabs were collected from 840 poultry farms in 18 different Wilayas (provinces) of Algeria. Swabs were collected between 2011 and 2018 from breeding hens, laying hens, broilers, and turkeys. Identification was carried out by the classical culture methods, and the disc diffusion test was used to determine the antibiotic resistance patterns. S. aureus was isolated from 477 (56.8%) farms, and flock prevalence was 52.8%, 48.8%, 48.4%, and 75.6% in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers, and turkeys, respectively. MRSA was isolated from 252 (30%) farms and flock prevalence was 22%, 33.5%, 27.4%, and 36%, respectively. As expected, all MRSA isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, penicillin G, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and oxacillin. High levels of resistance were found for tetracycline (82.5%), erythromycin (70.6%), clindamycin (68.6%), and ciprofloxacin (50%). Almost all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (100%) and mupirocin and rifampicin (99.2%), followed by chloramphenicol (82.3%), and gentamicin (76%). This moderate proportion of MRSA in poultry poses a considerable risk to public health. The results of this study highlight the need for control programs that encompass primary animal production and the food chain to mitigate contamination and spread of MRSA in the poultry industry of Algeria, and consequently to humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, this study characterized 17 feline non-epithelial pancreatic tumors, including clinical data, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Seventeen feline pancreatic tissue samples were investigated histopathologically and immunohistochemically. Selected pancreatic and inflammatory serum parameters, e.g., feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI), 1,2-o-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-(6'-methylresorufin) ester (DGGR) lipase and serum amyloid A (SAA), were recorded, when available. The neoplasms were characterized as round (n = 13) or spindle (n = 4) cell tumors. Round cell tumors included 12 lymphomas and one mast cell tumor in ectopic splenic tissue within the pancreas. Lymphomas were of T-cell (n = 9) or B-cell (n = 3) origin. These cats showed leukocytosis (3/3) and increased fPLI (5/5), DGGR lipase (3/5) and SAA (4/5) values. Spindle cell tumors included two hemangiosarcomas, one pleomorphic sarcoma and one fibrosarcoma. The cat with pleomorphic sarcoma showed increased SAA value. Overall survival time was two weeks to seven months. These are the first descriptions of a pancreatic pleomorphic sarcoma and a mast cell tumor in accessory spleens within feline pancreas. Although rare, pancreatic tumors should be considered in cats presenting with clinical signs and clinical pathology changes of pancreatitis. Only histopathology can certainly distinguish solitary pancreatitis from a neoplasm with inflammation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although human salmonellosis is frequently associated with ingestion of contaminated foods of animal origin, contact with animals may also be a significant source of Salmonella infection, especially contact with turtles, which have shown to be an important reservoir of Salmonella, specifically through their intestinal tracts. Turtles are among the most common reptiles kept as house pets that may pose a public health risk associated with Salmonella exposure, especially among infants and young children. This review discusses the literature reporting the link between turtles and Salmonella as well as turtle-associated human salmonellosis in the last ten years. In most outbreaks, a high proportion of patients are children under five years of age, which indicates that children are at the greatest risk of turtle-associated salmonellosis. Therefore, turtles should not be preferred as recommended pets for children under five years of age. Reducing turtle stress to minimise Salmonella shedding as well as providing client education handouts at the points of sale of these animals may reduce the risk of transmitting such significant pathogen to humans. Further studies are required to investigate the role of both direct contact with turtles as well as indirect contact through cross-contamination in the transmission of turtles-associated Salmonella to humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of joint lavage with different DMSO concentrations on biomarkers of synovial fluid inflammation and cartilage degradation in joints with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synovitis. Twenty-six tibiotarsal joints of 13 horses were randomly distributed into four groups (lactated Ringer's solution; 5% DMSO in lactated Ringer's; 10% DMSO in lactated Ringer's; and sham). All animals were evaluated for the presence of lameness, and synovial fluid analyses were performed at 0 h, 1 h, 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h (T0, T1, T8, T24, and T48, respectively). The white blood cell counts (WBC), total protein (TP), urea, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), hyaluronic acid (HA), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) concentrations were measured. The WBC counts and PGE2, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TP concentrations increased in all groups at T8 compared to baseline values (p&lt;0.05). At T48, only the 5% DMSO and 10% DMSO groups showed a significant decrease in WBC counts (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the 10% DMSO group had lower concentrations of PGE2 and IL-1&#946; at T48 than at T8 (p&lt;0.05) and presented lower IL-6 levels than the5% DMSO and lactated Ringer's groups at T24. All groups showed an increase in CS concentration after LPS-induced synovitis. Joint lavage with 10% DMSO in lactated Ringer&#180;s has anti-inflammatory but not chondroprotective effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32369966</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Outcome and Economic Viability of Embryo Production Using IVF and SOV Techniques in the Wagyu Breed of Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>The Japanese black cattle breed (Wagyu) has an improved metabolism, which allows them to have a higher marbling score when compared with other cattle breeds. However, this may affect other aspects of the animal's physiology, including hormone secretion and their reproductive success, such as their response to synchronization protocols and embryo production. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to test a superovulation protocol (SOV) developed with low doses of FSH and to evaluate the outcome and economic viability of embryo production using the SOV and in vitro fertilization (IVF) approaches in the Wagyu cattle breed. For that, ten Wagyu cows were submitted to five SOVs over a period of 15 months using a standard protocol: CIDR + 3 mg estradiol benzoate (D0), 35 mg FSH (Folltropin[&#174;]) a.m. and p.m. (D4), 35 mg Folltropin[&#174;] a.m. and 20 mg p.m. (D5), 20 mg Folltropin[&#174;] a.m. and 10 mg p.m. (D6), 10 mg Folltropin[&#174;] and 0.5 mg cloprostenol, both a.m. and p.m., + CIDR removal (D7), 0.05 mg GnRH + insemination 12 and 24 h after (D8) and embryo collection + 0.5 mg of cloprostenol (D16). Thirty days after each SOV, a follicular aspiration was conducted to produce IVF embryos without any pre-synchronization using standard semen in the same group of animals. The average number of embryos produced was 7.63 &#177; 5.61 (SOV) and 4.52 &#177; 2.44 (IVF) (p = 0.303). There was no significant correlation between the number of embryos produced by the different techniques (SOV and IVF), indicating that cows that respond well to SOV did not respond well to IVF and vice versa (r = 0.379, p = 0.529). The total cost of each embryo produced by SOV was R$215.00 and R$410.00 for IVF. Therefore, cows that produce less than five embryos by SOV are not economically viable due their lack of response to FSH, and the use of IVF in those animals may be more effective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study evaluated chronic toxicity in male goats exposed to arsenic via one ex situ Group 1 (n = 5) and one in situ female goats Group 3 (n = 10). The treatment in Group 1 was carried out in the La Laguna experimental field of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agr&#237;colas y Pecuarias (INIFAP), located in Matamoros, Coahuila, Mexico. Sodium arsenite (2 mg/kg) was orally administered for 84 days to five male Creole goats, aged between four and five years old and weighing between 60 and 70 kg, in order to determine its effect on urine toxicity, libido, and physiological condition, an untreated group (n = 5) was included (Group 2). The experiment in group 3 was conducted on ten female Creole goats, aged between four and six years old and weighing between 40 and 49 kg, in both the contaminated sampling area in the rural community of El Venado and the control sampling area in the rural community of Nuevo Reynosa (Group 4 (n = 5)), in which the arsenic levels were measured in the urine of the exposed goats, as was their physiological condition. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) between the groups were found in both the arsenic concentration in the urine and the physiological condition observed in both experimental groups.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the literature there is a lack of standardized studies of the use of color Doppler flow on healthy avian species. For this purpose, we examined blood flow in the heart in the four-chamber view of clinically healthy awake racing pigeons (n = 43) by color flow Doppler sonography. With this technique the diastolic and systolic blood flow in the heart chambers and the heart valve regions were well visualized. However, the pulse repetition frequency must be adapted to the specific blood flow velocities of the heart region to be measured to reduce aliasing in higher velocities and to visualize blood flow of lower velocities. With the help of color Doppler imaging in the four-chamber view, typical physiological atrial and ventricular blood flow vortex formations were visualized in the avian heart for the first time. In the left ventricle an asymmetric vortex ring in the passive and active ventricular filling, in the right ventricle a great counter-clockwise blood vortex in the active ventricular filling, in the left atrium a vortex clockwise, and in the right atrium counter-clockwise were observed. The knowledge of these physiological blood flow vortices is important to identify pathological blood flow.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

By employing text-mining approaches, research trends were tested by analyzing over 14,000 publications during the period of 1957 to 2017. Quantitatively, the data revealed an exponential growth until 2010 when the number of articles published per year ceased following the trend. Analysis of author-assigned keywords revealed that changes in keywords occurred roughly every decade with the most fundamental change in 1991-1992, instead of 2006. This change might be due to several factors including the research intensification on the Varroa mite. The genome release and CCD had quantitively only minor effects, mainly on honey bee health-related topics post-2006. Further analysis revealed that computational topic modeling can provide potentially hidden information and connections between some topics that might be ignored in author-assigned keywords.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to understand the presence and potential contribution of stem cells (SCs) as tumour-initiating cells in canine cutaneous tumours, we selected three putative SC markers (Lgr5, Lgr6 and Sox9) and investigated their expression pattern, level of protein and mRNA expression, in 43 canine hair follicle (HF) and 18 canine cutaneous epidermal tumours by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, using normal skin samples as controls. Lgr5 protein expression was not detected in epidermal and HF tumours; however, Lgr5 mRNA overexpression was evident in some HF tumours. Sox9 was expressed in several tumour cases, both at the protein and mRNA level. The Lgr6 antibody tested was not suitable for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples, but Lgr6 gene showed higher expression in several samples of both HF and epidermal tumours compared with normal skin. Significantly higher mRNA expression levels of the three SC markers were found in trichoblastomas (TB) compared with basal cell carcinomas (BCC). The present results indicated that canine HF and epidermal tumours might have common tumour-initiating cells. The mRNA expression of the three selected SC markers, especially Lgr5, could be potentially useful in the distinction between canine TB and BCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although predominantly expressed in the heart, the role of SMYD2 in heart development has yet to be fully elucidated and has even been shown to be dispensable in a murine Nkx2-5-associated conditional knockout. Additionally, SMYD2 was recently shown to be necessary not only for lymphocyte development but also for the viability of hematopoietic leukemias. Based on the broad expression pattern of SMYD2 in mammalian tissues, it is likely that it plays pivotal roles in a host of additional normal and pathological processes. In this brief review, we consider what is currently known about the normal and pathogenic functions of SMYD2 and propose specific future directions for characterizing its role in embryogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Study Design: Literature review. Sample Population: 92 peer-reviewed articles. Methods: An electronic database search identified human and veterinary literature on the effects of pneumoperitoneum (carbon dioxide insufflation for laparoscopy) and alternatives with a focus on adaptation to the veterinary field. Results: Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for many human and several veterinary procedures due to the lower morbidity associated with minimally invasive surgery, compared to laparotomy. The establishment of a pneumoperitoneum with a gas most commonly facilitates a working space. Carbon dioxide is the preferred gas for insufflation as it is inert, inexpensive, noncombustible, colorless, excreted by the lungs and highly soluble in water. Detrimental side effects such as acidosis, hypercapnia, reduction in cardiac output, decreased pulmonary compliance, hypothermia and post-operative pain have been associated with a pneumoperitoneum established with CO2 insufflation. As such alternatives have been suggested such as helium, nitrous oxide, warmed and humidified carbon dioxide and gasless laparoscopy. None of these alternatives have found a consistent benefit over standard carbon dioxide insufflation. Conclusions: The physiologic alterations seen with CO2 insufflation at the current recommended intra-abdominal pressures are mild and of transient duration. Clinical Significance: The current recommendations in veterinary laparoscopy for a pneumoperitoneum using carbon dioxide appear to be safe and effective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two hundred broiler chicks were divided into eight equal groups. The first group was used as a negative control group. Three groups were vaccinated at day 1 with the avian colibacillosis live vaccine of which one group served as a vaccinated nonchallenged group. Another two groups were treated with lectin product (0.5 mL/L drinking water) for three days before the challenge. The last two groups served as challenge control for either E. coli O78 or O125 strains. The challenge was conducted at three weeks of age with either homologous O78 or heterologous O125 E. coli strains, using 0.5 mL/bird of each avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strain (~10[8] colony forming units "CFU"/mL)/subcutaneously. The bodyweight and feed conversion ratios (FCR) were calculated for four weeks. Clinical signs and gross and histopathological lesions were scored at two and seven days post inoculation (dpi). The heart and liver of euthanized chickens at 2 dpi were removed aseptically and homogenized to evaluate pathogenic E. coli colonization. Results showed that live avian colibacillosis vaccine reduced mortalities and APEC colonization in the homologous challenge group but not in the heterologous challenge group. Lectin-treated groups showed 20% and 16% mortality after challenge with E. coli O78 and O125, respectively, and both groups showed performance parameters, clinical signs, and histopathological lesion scores comparable to the negative control group, with variable E. coli colonization of heart and liver. The study demonstrated the efficacy of live attenuated avian colibacillosis vaccine against homologous but not heterologous APEC challenge in broiler chickens. The lectin-containing products can be used as a preventive medication to reduce the clinical impacts of colibacillosis regardless of the challenge strain. Standardization of the evaluation parameters for APEC vaccines is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cattle also act as a reservoir host for L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo which is excreted from renal tubules via urine into the environment where it persists in suitable moist conditions. Our previous work demonstrated that 7% of urine samples from beef cattle were positive for L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo by culture and/or the fluorescent antibody test (FAT). In this study, a real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay was applied to determine the relative performance of rtPCR based detection of L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo compared to previously reported culture and FAT techniques. Of 42 bovine urine samples positive for leptospires by culture and/or FAT, 60% (25/42) were positive by rtPCR. Of 22 culture-positive samples, 91% (20/22) were rtPCR-positive. Of 32 FAT-positive samples, 50% (16/32) were rtPCR-positive. For 10 samples that were culture-positive but FAT-negative, 90% (9/10) were rtPCR-positive. For 20 samples that were FAT-positive but culture-negative, 25% (5/20) were rtPCR-positive. Collectively, these results indicate that no single assay is optimal, and the use of more than one assay to detect leptospires in urine from naturally infected cattle is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recently it was demonstrated that thalidomide extends the survival time of dogs with HSA, potentially due to thalidomide-induced inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the neoplastic cells. To investigate this, immunostaining was used to evaluate VEGF within HSA metastases that developed after thalidomide treatment. The immunostaining was then compared to VEGF immunostaining in primary tumors from the same dogs prior to treatment with thalidomide and in metastatic tumors from untreated dogs with splenic HSA. Immunostaining was scored from 1 to 4 for each sample. Immunostaining in the metastatic lesions that had been treated with thalidomide had a mean immunostaining score of 1.4 which was significantly lower than the mean score in the corresponding primary splenic HSA (3.8, p = 0.02) and in metastases from untreated dogs (3.5, p = 0.02). This supports the hypothesis that thalidomide prolongs survival time in dogs with HSA due to inhibition of VEGF production by the neoplastic cells. As VEGF remained visible within HSAs exposed to thalidomide, additional treatments to inhibit VEGF production may further prolong survival times of dogs with these common canine neoplasms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An ongoing controversy exists among researchers related to the weight of the rooster and its fertilization capacity. By histological and biochemical tests, the association between weight and age with oxidant damage, testicular parenchyma and antioxidant capacity was evaluated in Ross 308 roosters. Testicular integrity was assessed by histological analysis, oxidative stress was determined by malondialdehyde content, non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity was determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay and enzymatic antioxidant capacity through glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase activities. Histological analysis showed vacuolization of the epithelium from the seminiferous tubules. A significant negative association was observed between malondialdehyde and the deterioration of the integrity of the seminiferous epithelium, as well as between age and integrity of the seminiferous epithelium. It became evident that oxidative damage directly affects the quality of testicular parenchyma. Weight and age were not associated with the antioxidant enzymes activities, but with non-enzymatic capacity. The data obtained suggest that weight is not the most important factor that influences the fertility of the rooster.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To obtain a better insight into the genesis and neoplastic transformation, 19 samples collected at slaughter from Holstein Friesian cattle and diagnosed as Ocular Squamous Cell Carcinoma were studied. Tumours were histologically classified into three categories: poorly (26.3%), moderately (26.3%), and well differentiated (47.4%). Expression of keratins (MNF116 and LP34) and of cornified envelope precursors (involucrin and profilaggrin) was studied. Expression of MNF116 was observed in all carcinomas. LP34 immunostaining was seen in all but three carcinomas, one from each degree. Involucrin immunoreaction was observed in all but one poorly differentiated carcinoma. Profilaggrin was present in only two moderately differentiated carcinomas, in all but one well differentiated, and in all but one poorly differentiated. MNF116 is a useful marker to confirm the epithelial origin of the tumour and stain most neoplastic cells in these tumours. The expression of involucrin and LP34 demonstrates that, in all tumours, cells have reached the final program of differentiation, regardless of the grade. The expression of profilaggrin could indicate molecular changes during malignant transformation but their expression does not seem to be of diagnostic value.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mechanisms to dissipate excess heat divert energy from efficient production. This includes increased energy expenditure for respiration, oxidative stress and micronutrient absorption. The fortification of diets with particular feed additives has been known as one of the most important approaches to minimize the negative impacts of heat stress on broiler production. In this context, the promising functional feed additives appeared to be selenium and vitamins E and C. The fortification of broiler diets with these feed additives has been proven to enhance the function of vital organs, immune system response and growth performance of broilers under heat stress. The current review highlights recent successful experiences in the alleviation of heat stress symptoms in broilers using the above-mentioned additives. Selenium and vitamins E and C enhanced production performance in broiler chickens challenged with acute heat stress. The combination of these additives, by employing multiple mechanisms and through synergistic effects, improves heat stress symptoms more efficiently than their individual forms. Emerging literature reveals that selenium and vitamins E and C are involved in close interactions to protect proteins and lipids from oxidative damage and boost immune system function.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aims of the study were to evaluate SDMA in dogs with acute pancreatitis (AP) and its relationship with the presence of kidney injury and mortality. A cohort study including fifty-four dogs with AP diagnosed using compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL and compatible abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission, was conducted. Dogs with history of renal and/or urinary diseases were excluded, along with dogs exposed to nephrotoxic drugs. Serum urea and creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed and graded using International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) guidelines. SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Fifty-four dogs were included and divided in non-AKI (n = 37) and AKI dogs (n = 17). Twenty-three dogs (14 non-AKI) had SDMA &gt; 15 &#956;g/dL. Median SDMA was higher in AKI dogs than non-AKI dogs (25.7 vs. 13.93 &#956;g/dL; p = 0.03). Dogs with normal creatinine (AP and AKI 1 dogs) had SDMA above reference range in 38% and 33% of cases, respectively. In AKI dogs, SDMA and creatinine were positively correlated (p = 0.006 r = 0.7). SDMA was not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Although further studies are warranted, SDMA may be a useful tool in canine AP, as a high SDMA may be related to subclinical kidney impairment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to investigate the distribution and diversity of hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza virus (AIV) in poultry and wild birds in Bangladesh. We conducted an avian influenza sero-surveillance in wild and domestic birds in wetlands of Chattogram and Sylhet in the winter seasons 2012-2014. We tested serum samples using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA), and randomly selected positive serum samples (170 of 942) were tested using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) to detect antibodies against the 16 different HA sero-subtypes. All AIV sero-subtypes except H7, H11, H14 and H15 were identified in the present study, with H5 and H9 dominating over other subtypes, regardless of the bird species. The diversity of HA sero-subtypes within groups ranged from 3 (in household chickens) to 10 (in migratory birds). The prevalence of the H5 sero-subtype was 76.3% (29/38) in nomadic ducks, 71.4% (5/7) in household chicken, 66.7% (24/36) in resident wild birds, 65.9% (27/41) in migratory birds and 61.7% (29/47) in household ducks. Moreover, the H9 sero-subtype was common in migratory birds (56%; 23/41), followed by 38.3% (18/47) in household ducks, 36.8% (14/38) in nomadic ducks, 30.6% (11/66) in resident wild birds and 28.5% (2/7) in household chickens. H1, H4 and H6 sero-subtypes were the most common sero-subtypes (80%; 8/10, 70%; 7/10 and 70%; 7/10, respectively) in migratory birds in 2012, H9 in resident wild birds (83.3%; 5/6) and H2 in nomadic ducks (73.9%; 17/23) in 2013, and the H5 sero-subtype in all types of birds (50% to 100%) in 2014. The present study demonstrates that a high diversity of HA subtypes circulated in diverse bird species in Bangladesh, and this broad range of AIV hosts may increase the probability of AIVs' reassortment and may enhance the emergence of novel AIV strains. A continued surveillance for AIV at targeted domestic-wild bird interfaces is recommended to understand the ecology and evolution of AIVs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of E. rhusiopathiae remains to be elucidated. In this study, the complete genome sequence of the E. rhusiopathiae strain WH13013, a pathogenic isolate from a diseased pig, was generated using a combined strategy of PacBio RSII and Illumina sequencing technologies. The strategy finally generated a single circular chromosome of approximately 1.78 Mb in size for the complete genome of WH13013, with an average GC content of 36.49%. The genome of WH13013 encoded 1633 predicted proteins, 55 tRNAs, as well as 15 rRNAs. It contained four genomic islands and several resistance-associated genes were identified within these islands. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WH13013 was close to many other sequenced E. rhusiopathiae virulent strains. The comprehensive comparative analysis of eight E. rhusiopathiae virulent strains, including WH13013, identified a total of 1184 core genes. A large proportion (approximately 75.31%) of these core genes participated in nutrition and energy uptake and metabolism as well as the other bioactivities that are necessary for bacterial survival and adaption. The core genes also contained those encoding proteins participating in the biosynthesis and/or the components of the proposed virulence factors of E. rhusiopathiae, including the capsule (cpsA, cpsB, cpsC), neuraminidase (nanH), hyaluronidase (hylA, hylB, hylC), and surface proteins (spaA, rspA, rspB). The obtaining of the complete genome sequence of this virulent strain, WH13013, and this comprehensive comparative genome analysis will help in further studies of the genetic basis of the pathogenesis of E. rhusiopathiae.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32517251</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Public Perceptions of Veterinarians from Social and Online Media Listening.</Title>	<Abstract>The public perception of the veterinary medicine profession is of increasing concern given the mounting challenges facing the industry, ranging from student debt loads to mental health implications arising from compassion fatigue, euthanasia, and other challenging aspects of the profession. This analysis employs social media listening and analysis to discern top themes arising from social and online media posts referencing veterinarians. Social media sentiment analysis is also employed to aid in quantifying the search results, in terms of whether they are positivity/negativity associated. From September 2017-November 2019, over 1.4 million posts and 1.7 million mentions were analyzed; the top domain in the search results was Twitter (74%). The mean net sentiment associated with the search conducted over the time period studied was 52%. The top terms revealed in the searches conducted revolved mainly around care of or concern for pet animals. The recognition of challenges facing the veterinary medicine profession were notably absent, except for the mention of suicide risks. While undeniably influenced by the search terms selected, which were directed towards client-clinic related verbiage, a relative lack of knowledge regarding veterinarians' roles in human health, food safety/security, and society generally outside of companion animal care was recognized. Future research aimed at determining the value of veterinarians' contributions to society and, in particular, in the scope of One Health, may aid in forming future communication and education campaigns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Total viable aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, Escherichia coli, lactic acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., aerobic bacterial endospores and Enterococcus spp. were determined using a culture-based method. Two veterinary drugs (Varromed[&#174;] and Api-Bioxal[&#174;]), two commercial dietary supplements (ApiHerb[&#174;] and ApiGo[&#174;]) and two non-protein amino acids (GABA and beta-alanine) were administered for one week to honey bee foragers reared in laboratory cages. After one week, E. coli and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly affected by the veterinary drugs (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, dietary supplements and non-protein amino acids induced significant changes in Staphylococcus spp., E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this investigation showed that the administration of the veterinary drugs, dietary supplements and non-protein amino acids tested, affected the ventriculum microbiological profile of Apis mellifera ligustica.GABA; beta-alanine; oxalic acid; diet effect; microbiota.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32545802</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Global DNA Methylation in Different Gene Regions Reveals Candidate Biomarkers in Pigs with High and Low Levels of Boar Taint.</Title>	<Abstract>DNA methylation of different gene components, including different exons and introns, or different lengths of exons and introns is associated with differences in gene expression. To investigate the methylation of porcine gene components associated with the boar taint (BT) trait, this study used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from nine porcine testis samples in three BT groups (low, medium and high BT). The results showed that the methylation levels of the first exons and first introns were lower than those of the other exons and introns. The first exons/introns of CpG island regions had even lower levels of methylation. A total of 123 differentially methylated promoters (DMPs), 194 differentially methylated exons (DMEs) and 402 differentially methylated introns (DMIs) were identified, of which 80 DMPs (DMP-CpGis), 112 DMEs (DME-CpGis) and 166 DMIs (DMI-CpGis) were discovered in CpG islands. Importantly, GPX1 contained one each of DMP, DME, DMI, DMP-CpGi, DME-CpGi and DMI-CpGi. Gene-GO term relationships and pathways analysis showed DMP-CpGi-related genes are mainly involved in methylation-related biological functions. In addition, gene-gene interaction networks consisted of nodes that were hypo-methylated GPX1, hypo-methylated APP, hypo-methylated ATOX1, hyper-methylated ADRB2, hyper-methylated RPS6KA1 and hyper-methylated PNMT. They could be used as candidate biomarkers for reducing boar taint in pigs, after further validation in large cohorts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Special attention is currently being paid to a family of naturally occurring lipid amides acting through the so-called autacoid local injury antagonism, i.e., the ALIA mechanism. The parent molecule of ALIAmides, palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA), has being known since the 1950s as a nutritional factor with protective properties. Since then, PEA has been isolated from a variety of plant and animal food sources and its proresolving function in the mammalian body has been increasingly investigated. The discovery of the close interconnection between ALIAmides and the endocannabinoid system has greatly stimulated research efforts in this field. The multitarget and highly redundant mechanisms through which PEA exerts prohomeostatic functions fully breaks with the classical pharmacology view of "one drug, one target, one disease", opening a new era in the management of animals' health, i.e., an according-to-nature biomodulation of body responses to different stimuli and injury. The present review focuses on the direct and indirect endocannabinoid receptor agonism by PEA and its analogues and also targets the main findings from experimental and clinical studies on ALIAmides in animal health and wellbeing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32580381</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Infectious Bronchitis Virus Evolution, Diagnosis and Control.</Title>	<Abstract>RNA viruses are characterized by high mutation and recombination rates, which allow a rapid adaptation to new environments. Most of the emerging diseases and host jumps are therefore sustained by these viruses. Rapid evolution may also hinder the understanding of molecular epidemiology, affect the sensitivity of diagnostic assays, limit the vaccine efficacy and favor episodes of immune escape, thus significantly complicating the control of even well-known pathogens. The history of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) fits well with the above-mentioned scenario. Despite being known since the 1930s, it still represents one of the main causes of disease and economic losses for the poultry industry. A plethora of strategies have been developed and applied over time, with variable success, to limit its impact. However, they have rarely been evaluated objectively and on an adequate scale. Therefore, the actual advantages and disadvantages of IBV detection and control strategies, as well as their implementation, still largely depend on individual sensibility. The present manuscript aims to review the main features of IBV biology and evolution, focusing on their relevance and potential applications in terms of diagnosis and control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Commercial live (attenuated) and inactivated vaccines are reported to have limited efficacy in the context of heterologous challenge. Autogenous vaccination, using field isolates, is widely used, but scarcely documented. Different vaccination programs, including a live commercial vaccine and/or an inactivated autogenous vaccine, were compared for three different avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strain (serotypes O78, O18 and O111) challenges. On the pullet farm, four groups of conventional pullets received different vaccination protocols. Group A was kept unvaccinated (control group). Group B was vaccinated three times with a live commercial O78 E. coli vaccine (at one day old, 59 and 110 days of age). Group C was immunized twice (at 79 and 110 days) with a three-valence autogenous vaccine (O78, O18 and O111). Group D was vaccinated first with the commercial vaccine (at one day old and 59 days), then with the autogenous vaccine (110 days). Birds were transferred to the experimental facility at 121 days of age and were challenged 10 days later. In each group, 20 birds were challenged with one of the three APEC strains (O78, O18, O111); in total, 80 birds were challenged by the same strains (20 per group). The recorded outcomes were: mortality rate, macroscopic lesion score in target organs and the bacterial recovery of the challenge strain from bone marrow and pooled organs. When challenged with O78 or O111 strains, birds from groups C and D proved to be significantly better protected, in terms of lesion scoring and bacteriological isolation, than those of groups A and B. With the O18 challenge, only birds of group D presented a statistically significant reduction of their lesion score. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy of an immunization program in poultry that combines commercial and autogenous vaccines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to evaluate MAP antibody kinetics in serum and milk samples throughout the lactation period in dairy cattle. The samples were collected simultaneously from eight MAP-positive and two healthy MAP-negative (control group) cows. The MAP antibody was detected by using serum and milk ELISA. The serum and milk MAP antibody titers fluctuated between the positive and negative cut-off values in this study. Specifically, cattle with low MAP antibody titer (&lt;100) showed fluctuation between the cut-off values. Variable changes of MAP antibody titer were also observed after parturition. Between the serum and milk MAP antibody titers, there was a positive correlation (R[2] = 0.5358) observed throughout the assessment period. The milk MAP ELISA test had low diagnostic performance in cows with low MAP titer due to its weak correlation (R[2] = 0.0198). Finally, this study suggest that the periodic MAP ELISA test is recommended for the application of Johne's eradication program due to the fluctuating nature of MAP antibody kinetics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32629926</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Surveillance for Borrelia spp. in Upland Game Birds in Pennsylvania, USA.</Title>	<Abstract>The Borrelia genus contains two major clades, the Lyme borreliosis group, which includes the causative agents of Lyme disease/borreliosis (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and other related B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies), and the relapsing fever borreliosis group (B. hermsii, B. turicatae, and B. parkeri). Other unclassified reptile- and echidna-associated Borrelia spp. (i.e., B. turcica and 'Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi', respectively) do not belong in either of these two groups. In North America, Borrelia spp. from both of the major clades are important pathogens of veterinary and public health concern. Lyme disease is of particular interest because the incidence in the northeastern United States continues to increase in both dogs and humans. Birds have a potentially important role in the ecology of Borrelia species because they are hosts for numerous tick vectors and competent hosts for various Borrelia spp. Our goal was to investigate the prevalence of Borrelia spp. in four free-living species of upland game birds in Pennsylvania, USA including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), and American woodcock (Scolopax minor). We tested 205 tissue samples (bone marrow and/or spleen samples) from 169 individuals for Borrelia using a flagellin gene (flab) nested PCR, which amplifies all Borrelia species. We detected Borrelia DNA in 12% (24/205) of samples, the highest prevalence was in wild turkeys (16%; 5/31), followed by ruffed grouse (13%; 16/126) and American woodcock (3%; 1/35). All pheasants (n = 13) were negative. We sequenced amplicons from all positive game birds and all were B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Our results support previous work indicating that certain species of upland game birds are commonly infected with Borrelia species, but unlike previous studies, we did not find any relapsing fever borreliae.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32630632</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Asymmetries of Forelimb Digits of Young Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Based on the anatomical premise that, in bovines, the medial (inner) hoof is larger than the lateral (outer) one in the forelimb, we hypothesized that this implies a phalangeal form difference. To test this hypothesis, asymmetries of the forelimb acropodia (phalangeal series) were studied on calves belonging to the Brown Pyrenean breed, a meat breed managed under extensive conditions in NE Spain. Dorso-palmar radiographs were obtained for each acropodium in a sample of 17 paired left and right forelimbs. Size and shape were analysed by means of geometric morphometrics on medial and lateral acropodial series (III and IV series respectively) for each left and right limb. Shape coordinates were computed by Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Medial and lateral acropodial series appeared similar in size, but their shape expressed an especially high directional asymmetry, with distal phalanges (pedal bones) being abaxially (outwards) oriented. Such morphological observations may be an important reconsideration of "normal" radiographic acropodial symmetry evaluation. This can be explained not only by an unevenly distributed ground reaction force between acropodial series, but also between right and left limbs, making medial and lateral hoof surfaces differently prone to overloading and, accordingly, to injuries to the limb.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among UA, the vesicourachal diverticulum was the most prevalent UA diagnosed in both cats (96.7%) and dogs (89.5%): the intramural vesicourachal diverticulum was diagnosed in 76.7% of cats and 71.1% of dogs, followed by extramural vesicourachal diverticulum (20.0% and 18.4% respectively). In both cats and dogs, bladder wall diffuse or regional thickening was the most prevalent alteration. The most common alterations of the urinary bladder content were urolithiasis sediment in cats (33.3%) and in dogs (31.6%). Dogs with UA were more often asymptomatic (p = 0.01). No difference was found in cats. Stranguria, hematuria, and urethral obstruction were the most frequently reported clinical signs, while hematuria and leukocyturia were the most prevalent abnormalities at urinalysis. In conclusion, our study confirmed UA as uncommon, and often incidental findings, with a high prevalence of animals without clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This paper describes the prevalence of age-related behavioural changes and disease in two UK cat populations at separate time-points. (2) Methods: owners of cats aged &#8805;11 years completed questionnaires in 1995 (cohort 1: n = 1236), and from 2010-2015 (cohort 2: n = 883). (3) Results: the most important behavioural changes in these cats were increased affection towards their owners (reported by 51.9% in 1995; 35.8% in 2010-2015), increased vocalisation (63.5%; 58.9%, respectively), particularly at night (32%; 43.6%), and house-soiling (29.3%; 55.8%). Most (79.4%; 81%) of the cats had visited a veterinary surgeon since becoming 11 years old. The main reasons, aside from vaccinations, were dental disease, renal disease and lower urinary tract disorders in 1995, and dental disease, renal disease and hyperthyroidism in 2010-2015. All major diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently in 2010-2015 than in 1995; behavioural changes were variably associated with these diseases. (4) Conclusion: elderly cats display age-related behavioural changes and develop diseases that may be under-diagnosed. Veterinarians need to ask owners about these behavioural changes, as they may signify manageable conditions rather than reflect "normal" ageing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study sought to develop a novel approach to passively sampling honey bee hives using silicone wristbands. Wristbands placed in hives for 24 h captured various compounds, including long-chain hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, sugars, and sterols with wide ranging octanol-water partition coefficients (Kow) that varied by up to 19 orders of magnitude. Most of the compounds identified from the wristbands are known to be produced by bees or plants. This study indicates that silicone wristbands provide a simple, affordable, and passive method for sampling the chemical environment of honey bees.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We hypothesized that recruitment and activation of neutrophils into the teat canal and sinus are the mechanisms of action of bismuth subnitrate and keratin-based teat sealant formulations. To test this, a chemotaxis assay (Experiment 1) and a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay (Experiment 2) were conducted in vitro. Blood was sampled from 12 mid-lactation dairy cows of variable ages. Neutrophils were extracted and diluted to obtain cell suspensions of approximately 10[6] cells/mL. In Experiment 1, test substances were placed in a 96-well plate, separated from the cell suspension by a 3 &#181;m pore membrane and incubated for 3 h to allow neutrophils to migrate through the membrane. In Experiment 2, neutrophils were exposed to the test products and the amount of MPO released was measured by optical density. Results showed that neutrophils were not activated by bismuth or keratin products (p &lt; 0.05) in all of the tests performed. These results suggest that the mechanisms of action of bismuth subnitrate and keratin-based teat sealants do not rely on neutrophil recruitment and activation in the teat canal and sinus after treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While such a resource now exists, the cat continues to lag behind the domestic dog in terms of integration into the 'One Health' era of molecular medicine. Stimulated by the advances being made within the evolving field of comparative cancer genomics, we developed a microarray platform that allows rapid and sensitive detection of DNA copy number aberrations in feline tumors using comparative genomic hybridization analysis. The microarray comprises 110,456 unique oligonucleotide probes anchored at mean intervals of 22.6 kb throughout the feline reference genome sequence assembly, providing ~350-fold higher resolution than was previously possible using this technique. We demonstrate the utility of this resource through genomic profiling of a feline injection-site sarcoma case, revealing a highly disrupted profile of DNA copy number imbalance involving several key cancer-associated genes including KIT, TP53, PTEN, FAS and RB1. These findings were supported by targeted fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis, which identified major alterations in chromosome structure, including complex intrachromosomal reorganization events typical of those seen in aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas of other species. We then characterized a second mass that was identified at a nearby site in the same patient almost 12 months later. This mass demonstrated a remarkably conserved genomic profile consistent with a recurrence of the original tumor; however the detection of subtle differences reflected evolution of the tumor over time. These findings exemplify the diverse potential of this microarray platform to incorporate domestic cat cancers into comparative and translational research efforts in molecular oncology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(3) Results: A total of 74.7% noted that they mourned privately, 58.2% sought social support, 32.1% adopted a new companion animal, 12.4% relied on faith or prayer and 0.9% participated in a support group. (4) Conclusions: Grief associated with companion animal loss is important. As a majority of clients that euthanized their companion animal mourn privately, the veterinary community must work towards identifying and providing appropriate, accessible social resources for bereaved companion animal owners to utilize, if desired.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Korea, the target animal of the rabies bait vaccine is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Bait vaccines have been distributed in Korea for 20 years; although wild raccoon dogs have been tested for antibodies, rabies antibodies have never been investigated in non-target wild animals. Therefore, this study investigated rabies antibody formation in wild boars (Sus scrofa), which is likely the main competitor for the bait vaccine in Korea. In bait areas, 20 of 109 wild boars (18.3%) were seropositive, and 39 of 470 wild boars (8.3%) in non-bait areas were also seropositive. These results provide insights regarding bait uptake or vaccination in non-target wild boars.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Each animal underwent both protocols at a 1-week interval. The enhancement (HU) and time to peak enhancement on CT were measured for the aorta (AO), caudal vena cava (CVC), portal vein (PV), and hepatic parenchyma (HP). The contrast effects in the AO, PV, and HP were significantly delayed under medetomidine sedation compared to the control anesthesia protocol. Particularly, the contrast effect in the PV and HP was significantly delayed under sedation, appearing approximately 1 min after contrast medium injection. This delay likely reflects the peripheral vasoconstrictive effect of medetomidine. We noted a generally early high contrast enhancement of the CVC under medetomidine sedation, likely contributed by the induced bradycardia. Therefore, findings obtained on contrast enhancement CT under medetomidine sedation may be different from those obtained under propofol-induced sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia. These differences are important to consider when using the findings to inform diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Research has also focused specifically on whether and how changes in the gut microbiome have provoked the occurrence of pathological phenomena affecting cartilage and joints in humans and in laboratory animals. Here, we tried to evaluate the relationship between the gut microbiome and the hip and elbow arthritis in owned dogs. The study included 14 dogs suffering from chronic arthritis (AD) and 13 healthy dogs (HD). After the first visit and during the period of the study, the dogs, under the supervision of the owner, were fed a semi-moist complete diet supplemented with omega 3 fatty acids. Feces and blood samples were collected in the clinic at the first visit (T0) and after days (T45). The plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher, and the serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the AD group in comparison to the HD group. Data of the fecal microbiome showed that the relative abundances of the genus Megamonas were higher in AD (p &lt; 0.001), while the relative abundance of the families Paraprevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Mogibacteriaceae was significantly lower in comparison to HD. The results of the study identified several bacterial groups that differed significantly in the fecal microbiome between healthy and diseased dogs. If the observed differences in fecal bacterial composition predispose dogs to hip and elbow arthritis or if these differences reflect a correlation with these conditions deserves further investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood and urine samples were obtained from 12 crossbred steers weighing approximately 300 kg during the following periods: 11 h of normal feeding (postprandial period), 48 consecutive hours of fasting, followed by 48 h of re-feeding. Compared with the postprandial period, fasting caused the following modifications: moderate hypoglycemia accompanied by remarkable lipolysis detected by the increase in plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs); absence of hepatic lipidosis, as there were no changes in aspartate aminotransferase activity or serum cholesterol levels; mild ketogenesis, confirmed by the slight increase of &#946;-hydroxybutyrate (&#946;HB); increased amino acid burn for energy production, verified by the increase in serum urea contents. There were strong positive correlations between the plasma levels of FFAs and &#946;HB (r = 0.68; p &lt; 0.001), fasting duration and FFA concentration (r = 0.92; p &lt; 0.00001), and fasting duration and serum urea (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.001); there was a negative correlation between fasting duration and blood glucose (r = -0.52; p &lt; 0.0001). During this same period, mild hypovolemia characterized by an increase in intravascular volume deficit was observed. The metabolic condition observed during fasting was completely reversed during re-feeding, except for the temporarily higher proteolysis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the efficacy of hive products as virus vehicles is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the transmission capacity of hive products for Deformed wing virus genotype A (DWV-A) in a fully-crossed hoarding cage experiment and estimated the transmission risk by screening commercial products. Western honey bee workers were provided with honey, pollen and wax either contaminated with high (~2 &#215; 10[9]), medium (~1.7 &#215; 10[8]), low (~8 &#215; 10[6]) or zero (control) DWV-A genome copies. For 10 days, mortality was monitored. Then, virus titers were quantified in bee heads and 38 commercial products using RT-qPCR. For honey and pollen, a positive association between DWV-A concentration and mortality was observed. High concentrations always resulted in infections, medium ones in 47% of cases and low ones in 20% of cases. No significant difference was observed between the tested products. In commercial honey and pollen, 7.7 &#215; 10[2]-1.8 &#215; 10[5] and 1.4 &#215; 10[3]-1.3 &#215; 10[4] DWV-A copies per gram were found, respectively. The results show that DWV-A transmission via hive products is feasible. The risk of introducing novel viruses and/or strains should be considered in trade regulations by including virus analyses for health certificates of hive products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ninety-two non-clinical samples were obtained from three institutes and fifty-seven clinical samples were obtained from a veterinary hospital in Japan. Serum titers of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 isotype antibodies against MAP were measured using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IgG antibodies against MAP in non-clinical serum obtained from three institutes was observed to be 2.4%, 20% and 9.0%. Similarly, the IgG1 antibodies titers against MAP were observed to be 7%, 20% and 0%. Lastly, the IgG2 antibodies against MAP were observed to be 7%, 20% and 4.4%. No significance differences in these titers were observed among the three institutes. The IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in serum obtained from a veterinary hospital were observed to be 55.3%, 42% and 42%, respectively. Significant differences were found between the non-clinical and clinical samples. The titers in the clinical samples showed a high degree of variance, whereas low variance was found in the non-clinical samples. The IgG antibody levels were thought to be induced following exposure to MAP-contaminated feed. The difference in titers between the clinical and non-clinical samples is likely to be related to the amount of MAP antigen contamination in dog foods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32717797</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Exercise but Not Supplemental Dietary Tryptophan Influences Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate in Sled Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Tryptophan (Trp), an indispensable amino acid for dogs, is the precursor of serotonin, a neurotransmitter with a variety of effects throughout the body, including the ability to modulate cardiac and pulmonary activity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 12-week incremental exercise regimen and supplemental dietary Trp on heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) in client-owned sled dogs. Sixteen Siberian huskies were randomly allocated to either treatment or control diet groups. Both groups were fed a control diet (Trp to large neutral amino acid ratio of 0.047:1); however, treatment dogs received a Trp supplement to achieve a Trp to large neutral amino acid ratio of 0.075:1. Every three weeks, external telemetry equipment was used to non-invasively measure and record HR and RR at a resting, working, and post-exercise state in a controlled exercise challenge. A mixed model was used to test differences between diet, activity parameter, and week. Dietary Trp supplementation had no effect on HR or RR. Independent of diet, resting, working, post-exercise HR, and time to recover post-exercise HR decreased from week -1 to week 11 (p &lt; 0.05). Resting HR had the greatest reduction from week -1 to week 11 (21%, p &lt; 0.05). Working RR did not change with exercise (p &gt; 0.10), but rRR and postRR decreased from week -1 to week 11 (p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that the exercise regimen the dogs were subjected to may have positively impacted the dogs' capacity to sustain aerobic exercise, whereas Trp supplementation had no effect on HR or RR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four mid-lactation Thai Holstein-Friesian crossbred cows were studied. Pre-experiment milk yield was 12.7 &#177; 0.30 kg/day, and the body weight was 495 &#177; 40.0 kg. Animals were evaluated in a 2 &#215; 2 factorial in a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design to receive diets followed by: factor A, which was a dose of sulfur inclusion at 1.0% and 2.0%, and factor B, which was level of urea inclusion at 1.25% and 2.5% DM in FTMR. The hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentrations reduced 99.3% to 99.4% compared with fresh cassava root when FTMR was supplemented with 1.0% and 2.0% sulfur, respectively. Intake of crude protein was increased based on urea level addition (p &lt; 0.05). Blood thiocyanate concentration was increased by 21.6% when sulfur was supplemented at 2.0% compared to 1.0% (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in protozoal concentration, whereas bacterial populations at 4 h after feeding were significantly greater by 6.1% with the FTMR supplemented with 2.0% sulfur and 2.5% urea (p &lt; 0.01). Allantoin concentrations, excretion, absorption, and microbial crude protein showed significant interactions between sulfur levels and urea levels in cows fed diets supplemented with 2.0% sulfur and 2.5% urea (p &lt; 0.05). The molar ratios of the volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile were affected by dietary FTMR (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, propionic acid increased by 4.6% when diets were supplemented by 2.5% sulfur (p &lt; 0.01). Milk fat and total solids increased when feed was supplemented with 2.0% sulfur and 2.5% urea (p &lt; 0.05). The diets supplemented with 2.0% sulfur levels resulted in greater concentrations of milk thiocyanate (p &lt; 0.05). The somatic cell count was significantly reduced throughout the experiment with increasing sulfur supplementation (p &lt; 0.05). Animals fed diets supplemented with 2.0% sulfur exhibited a decreased somatic cell count by 18.3% compared with those fed diets supplemented with 1.0% sulfur. Thus, inclusion of 2.0% sulfur with 2.5% urea in FTMR containing fresh cassava root improved digestibility, ruminal fermentation, microbial crude protein synthesis, and milk qualities in dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32722145</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Epidemiology and National Surveillance System for Foot and Mouth Disease in Cattle in Thailand during 2008-2019.</Title>	<Abstract>Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a prominent transboundary disease that threatens livestock production and can disrupt the trade in animals and animal products at both regional and international levels. The aims of this study were: (1) to analyze the distribution of FMD in Thailand during the period of 2008 to 2019, (2) to outline a national surveillance approach, and (3) to identify the existing knowledge gap that is associated with this disease in relation to cattle production. We analyzed FMD outbreak data in order to determine the existing spatial and temporal trends and reviewed relevant publications and official documents that helped us outline a national surveillance program. There were 1209 FMD outbreaks in cattle farms during the study period. FMD outbreaks occurred every year throughout the study period in several regions. Notably, FMD serotype O and A were considered the predominant types. The FMD National Strategic Plan (2008-2015) and the national FMD control program (2016-2023) have been implemented in order to control this disease. The surveillance approach employed by livestock authorities included both active and passive surveillance techniques. The vaccination program was applied to herds of cattle 2-3 times per year. Additionally, numerous control measures have been implemented across the country. We have identified the need for a study on the assessment of an applicable surveillance program, the evaluation of an appropriate vaccination strategy and an assessment of the effectiveness of a measured control policy. In conclusion, this study provided much needed knowledge on the epidemiology of FMD outbreaks across Thailand from 2008 to 2019. Additionally, we identified the need for future studies to address the existing knowledge gaps. The findings from this study may also be useful for livestock authorities and stakeholders to establish an enhanced control strategy and to implement an effective surveillance system that would control and eradicate FMD throughout the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Initially characterized within the cardiovascular system, one such member, SMYD2, has been implicated in transcriptional and apoptotic regulation of hematopoiesis. Deletion of Smyd2 in adult mouse Hemaopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) using an interferon-inducible mx1-Cre-mediated conditional knockout (CKO) led to HSC reduction via both apoptosis and transcriptional deficiencies. Since HSC are specified from hemogenic endothelial (HE) cells in the dorsal aorta (DA), we sought to determine whether the flaw in HSC originated embryologically from this site. Toward this end, we performed deletion with vav-Cre mice, which is active in all hematopoietic and endothelial tissues from E10.5 embryonic life onward. Unexpectedly, we observed no defects in the embryo, other than apoptotic loss of definite HSC, whereas adult hematopoietic populations downstream were unaffected. These results further establish the importance of SMYD2 in antiapoptotic gene control of gene expression from the embryo to the adult.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In humans, neuropathic pain is a common symptom after BPI. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical signs, the electrodiagnostic findings, the outcome and the quality of life (QoL) of a cohort of dogs and cats with BPI. Clinical records of 40 dogs and 26 cats with BPI were retrospectively reviewed. Specific attention was put on the evaluation of electrodiagnostic findings (35/40 dogs; 14/26 cats) and telephonic interview results (26/40 dogs; 18/26 cats). The most common neurological condition was the inability to bear weight and sensory deficits on the affected limb. Radial and ulnar motor nerve conduction studies (MNCSs) were absent respectively in 47% (radial) and 62% (ulnar) of dogs and 57% (radial) and 57% (ulnar) of cats. The absence of radial (p = 0.003) and ulnar (p = 0.007) MNCSs in dogs and ulnar MNCSs in cats (p = 0.02) was significantly associated to the amputation of the affected limb. The owners described signs of pain/discomfort in 73% of dogs and 56% of cats. This is the first report suggesting that neuropathic pain/discomfort should be adequately considered in order to improve the QoL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Additionally, we list the different publications found in the literature with neoplastic lesions in wolves. Our results show similar immunohistochemical features to dogs, in which neoplastic cells express Vimentin, von Willebrand factor, alpha smooth muscle actin antibody, vascular endothelial growth factor C and low vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3. Toluidine blue special stain shows moderated increased numbers of mast cells infiltrating the tumor, a feature observed in benign vascular tumors in domestic dogs, but not in the malignant counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first article describing the gross, histological and immunohistochemical features of a splenic haemangioma in a wolf.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years. Despite this, the area remains under-researched and there is a lack of robust, high-quality research. Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0-100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7-60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7-57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32781537</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Assessment of Longitudinal Left Ventricle Deformation by 2-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography Obtained from Different Views in Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a novel, angle-independent imaging technique useful to assess myocardial function by strain and strain rate analysis in human and veterinary medicine. Commonly, the left apical four-chamber (LAP4Ch) view is used to assess left ventricular (LV) longitudinal deformation in dogs and cats. However, the right parasternal four-chamber (RP4Ch) view is often more easily obtained than the LAP4Ch view in cats. No studies exist comparing longitudinal strain and strain rate values using STE from different echocardiographic views in cats. Therefore, we examined the agreement between RP4Ch and LAP4Ch for assessment of LV longitudinal strain and strain rate in cats. We acquired 2D echocardiographic cineloops from RP4Ch and LAP4Ch views and analyzed LV longitudinal strain and strain rate in 50 cats (31 healthy cats and 19 cats with different disease states) using Xstrain[TM] software. Peak systolic strain and strain rate values of endocardial and epicardial border were used for the analysis. The two echocardiographic views were compared using limits-of-agreement analyses and intra-observer measurement variability was assessed. We could obtain longitudinal strain and strain rate from the RP4Ch view in all cats. Strain, but not strain rate, had good intra-observer measurement variability (&lt;10% vs. &lt;20%). However, only endocardial strain values obtained with the two views agreed sufficiently to be used interchangeably (95% limits of agreement: -3.28, 2.58). Epicardial strain/strain rate and endocardial strain rate values did not agree sufficiently to be used interchangeably (95% limits of agreement: -11.58, 9.19; -2.28, 1.74; -1.41, 1.36, respectively). Our study suggests that RP4Ch view was feasible for assessment of the LV longitudinal deformation analysis by STE in cats, but only endocardial longitudinal strain values obtained from the two different views were interchangeable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is highly contagious and is associated with a high mortality rate. The Philippines experienced an outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in 2017. As there is always a risk of re-emergence, efforts to manage disease outbreaks should be optimal. Linked to this is the need for an effective surveillance procedure to capture disease outbreaks at their early stage. Risk-based surveillance is the most effective and economical approach to outbreak management. This study evaluated the potential of commercial poultry farms in Central Luzon to transmit HPAI by calculating their respective reproductive ratios (R0). The reproductive number for each farm is based on the spatial kernel and the infectious period. A risk map has been created based on the calculated R0. There were 882 (76.63%) farms with R0 &lt; 1. Farms with R0 &#8805; 1 were all located in Pampanga Province. These farms were concentrated in the towns of San Luis (n = 12) and Candaba (n = 257). This study demonstrates the utility of mapping farm-level R0 estimates for informing HPAI risk management activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since then ASF has continued to spread in wild boar populations covering almost whole territory of the country. Sporadic outbreaks occurred at the same time in domestic pig holdings located in wild boar infected areas. Here we present the results of the epidemiological investigation in two large commercial farms. Several parameters were analyzed to determine the high risk period (HRP) and to investigate the ASF virus spread within the farm. Clinical data, mortality rates and laboratory results proved to be good indicators for estimating the HRP. The measures for early disease detection, particularly the enhanced passive surveillance that is targeting dead and sick pigs, were analyzed and discussed. Enhanced passive surveillance proved to be a key element to detect ASF at an early stage. The study also showed that ASF virus might spread slowly within a large farm depending mainly on direct contacts between pigs and the level of internal biosecurity. Findings suggest improvements in outbreak prevention, control measures and may contribute to a better understanding of ASF spreading patterns within large pig herds. Culling of all pigs in large commercial farms could be reconsidered under certain conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In recent years, there has been increased regulation against the use of antibacterial agents in swine due to their health risks. Utilizing experimental models that consistently recapitulate PWD is important for the development of non-antibacterial agents against PWD in pigs. In this study, we established a highly reproducible PWD infection model by examining differences in adhesion of ETEC to the intestinal tissue as well as the association between MUC4 polymorphisms and sensitivity to PWD. Post-weaning diarrhea differences between pig breeds were also examined. The adhesion to enterocytes varied from 10[4.0] to 10[6.4] CFU/mL even among the F4 ETEC strains. Experimental infection revealed that PWD can be induced in all MUC4 genotypes after infection with 10[10] CFU/pig of highly adherent ETEC, although there were variable sensitivities between the genotypes. Lowly adherent ETEC did not cause PWD as efficiently as did highly adherent ETEC. The incidence of PWD was confirmed for all pigs with the ETEC-susceptible MUC4 genotypes in all of the breeds. These results indicate that high-precision and reproducible experimental infection is possible regardless of pig breeds by controlling factors on the pig-end (MUC4 genotype) and the bacterial-end (adhesion ability).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Supplemental feeding of the agouti will decrease feeding cost to produce this animal and aid in sustainable agricultural practices. Male agoutis were used as this physiological state was the easiest to attain as well as male animals are generally used for meat production. The trial consisted of 16 male agoutis that were allocated into four dietary treatments using a completely randomized experimental design. Four diet treatments were used in the experiment; treatment 1 (T1) was the positive control which consisted of rabbit ration whilst treatment 2 (T2) to 4 (T4) had different ratios of O. glaberrima, Trichanthera gigantica and Rabbit Ration. The feeding trial had 8-week duration. T2 consisted of 5% T. gigantica, 35% O. glaberrima supplemented for rabbit ration. T3 had 10% T. gigantica and 40% O. glaberrima supplemented for rabbit ration. T4 consisted of 15% Trichanthera and 45% O. glaberrima supplemented for rabbit ration in the diet. Proximate analysis showed that Dry Matter (DM) and Ash was highest in T4 and lowest in T2. Whilst ether extract (EE) and crude protein (CP) were highest in T2 and lowest in T4. Crude fiber (CF) was highest in T3 and lowest in T2. The weights of the agoutis at the start of the experiment (2595 g-2971 g) were not significantly different to their final weight (2469-2762 g) (p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant difference seen between treatments groups and weeks of the experiment (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the interactions between treatment and weeks (p &gt; 0.05). T1 and T2 were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) with respect to average daily gain (-0.98 g/d, -1.61 g/d) and weight loss (55 g, 90 g). T2 can be used as an alternative feed source than rabbit ration (control diet) for adult male agoutis. As the final body mass of the male agoutis did not change with the inclusion of 40% Trichanthera and Moruga hill rice, this substitution can be used to maintain male agoutis before slaughter. However, higher amounts of supplements may be detrimental to this animal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there has been very little information available with regard to this antigen in dogs. This study aimed to investigate the expression of MAGE-A in canine mammary gland tumors (CMTs) using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting with human monoclonal MAGE-A antibody 6C1. The present study has provided evidence of cross-reactivity of the canine MAGE-A expression with the human MAGE-A antibody in CMTs. The MAGE-A antigens were expressed in moderate- and high-grade malignant CMTs (22.22%, 2/9), but no expression was observed in benign CMTs. The immunohistochemical staining of canine MAGE antigen in CMT cells showed nuclear and nuclear-cytoplasmic expression patterns that may be involved with the mitotic cell division of tumor cells. Molecular weights of the canine MAGE-A antigen presented in this study were approximately 42-62 kDa, which were close to those of other previous studies involving humans and dogs. The findings on this protein in CMTs could supply valuable oncological knowledge for the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and immunotherapeutic tumor markers in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32823495</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Manure as a Potential Hotspot for Antibiotic Resistance Dissemination by Horizontal Gene Transfer Events.</Title>	<Abstract>The increasing demand for animal-derived foods has led to intensive and large-scale livestock production with the consequent formation of large amounts of manure. Livestock manure is widely used in agricultural practices as soil fertilizer worldwide. However, several antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are frequently detected in manure and manure-amended soils. This review explores the role of manure in the persistence and dissemination of ARGs in the environment, analyzes the procedures used to decrease antimicrobial resistance in manure and the potential impact of manure application in public health. We highlight that manure shows unique features as a hotspot for antimicrobial gene dissemination by horizontal transfer events: richness in nutrients, a high abundance and diversity of bacteria populations and antibiotic residues that may exert a selective pressure on bacteria and trigger gene mobilization; reduction methodologies are able to reduce the concentrations of some, but not all, antimicrobials and microorganisms. Conjugation events are often seen in the manure environment, even after composting. Antibiotic resistance is considered a growing threat to human, animal and environmental health. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the amount of antimicrobials and the load of antimicrobial resistant bacteria that end up in soil.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32823756</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prevalence of the Microsporidian Nosema spp. in Honey Bee Populations (Apis mellifera) in Some Ecological Regions of North Asia.</Title>	<Abstract>Two species of microsporidia, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, are obligate intracellular parasites that are widespread in the world and cause the infectious disease (Nosemosis) of the Western honey bee Apis mellifera. Information on the prevalence and distribution of Nosema species in North Asia conditions is scarce. The main aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of Nosema spp. (Nosemosis) in honey bees inhabiting some inland regions of North Asia (Western and Eastern Siberia, Altai Territory, Russia, and northeastern part of Kazakhstan). The objective of the paper is also to assess the influence of climatic factors on the spread of N. ceranae. Eighty apiaries in four ecological regions of North Asia (southern taiga, sub-taiga zone, forest steppe, and mountain taiga forests) were investigated with regard to distribution, prevalence, and diversity of Nosema infection in honey bees using duplex-PCR. Nosema infected bees were found in 65% apiaries of ecoregions studied, and coinfection was predominant (36.3% of Nosema-positive apiaries). Both N. apis and N. ceranae occur across subarctic and warm summer continental climates, but while N. apis predominates in the former, N. ceranae is more predominant in the latter. No statistically significant differences in Nosema distribution were identified in various climatic zones. In the sub-taiga zone (subarctic climate), low presence of colonies with pure N. ceranae and a significantly higher proportion of coinfection apiaries were revealed. Long-term epidemiological study of Nosema spp. prevalence in the sub-taiga zone showed a surprising percentage increase of Nosema-positive apiaries from 46.2% to 74.1% during 2012-2017. From 2012 to 2015, N. apis became a predominant species, but in 2016-2017, the coinfection was mainly detected. In conclusion, the results of this investigation showed that N. ceranae is widespread in all study ecoregions of North Asia where it exists in combination with the N. apis, but there is no replacement of N. apis by N. ceranae in the studied bee populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we explored the effects of Lactobacillus johnsonii L531 on attenuating E. coli-induced inflammatory damage in porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs). L. johnsonii L531 pretreatment reduced E. coli adhesion to PMECs by competitive exclusion and the production of inhibitory factors and decreased E. coli-induced destruction of cellular morphology and ultrastructure. E. coli induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome associated with increased expression of NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1, however, L. johnsonii L531 inhibited E. coli-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Up-regulation of interleukin (Il)-1&#946;, Il-6, Il-8, Il-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and chemokine Cxcl2 expression after E. coli infection was attenuated by L. johnsonii L531. E. coli infection inhibited autophagy, whereas L. johnsonii L531 reversed the inhibitory effect of E. coli on autophagy by decreasing the expression of autophagic receptor SQSTM1/p62 and increasing the expression of autophagy-related proteins ATG5, ATG16L1, and light chain 3 protein by Western blotting analysis. Our findings suggest that L. johnsonii L531 pretreatment restricts NLRP3 inflammasome activity and induces autophagy through promoting ATG5/ATG16L1-mediated autophagy, thereby protecting against E. coli-induced inflammation and cell damage in PMECs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32824137</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Honey as a Source of Environmental DNA for the Detection and Monitoring of Honey Bee Pathogens and Parasites.</Title>	<Abstract>Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been proposed as a powerful tool to detect and monitor cryptic, elusive, or invasive organisms. We recently demonstrated that honey constitutes an easily accessible source of eDNA. In this study, we extracted DNA from 102 honey samples (74 from Italy and 28 from 17 other countries of all continents) and tested the presence of DNA of nine honey bee pathogens and parasites (Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Ascosphaera apis,Lotmaria passim, Acarapis woodi, Varroa destructor, and Tropilaelaps spp.) using qualitative PCR assays. All honey samples contained DNA from V. destructor, confirming the widespread diffusion of this mite. None of the samples gave positive amplifications for N. apis, A. woodi, and Tropilaelaps spp. M. plutonius was detected in 87% of the samples, whereas the other pathogens were detected in 43% to 57% of all samples. The frequency of Italian samples positive for P. larvae was significantly lower (49%) than in all other countries (79%). The co-occurrence of positive samples for L. passim and A. apis with N. ceranae was significant. This study demonstrated that honey eDNA can be useful to establish monitoring tools to evaluate the sanitary status of honey bee populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32824504</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Flow Cytometry-Detected Immunological Markers and on Farm Recorded Parameters in Composite Cow Milk as Related to Udder Health Status.</Title>	<Abstract>Flow cytometry is a powerful technology used in many fields of cell biology. It is also used as a routine method to count somatic cells in milk and to characterize bovine milk leukocytes. In this study, we used flow cytometry to simultaneously assess the viability, the percentage of the single subsets of leukocytes and to quantify the expression of CD11b, an immunological marker of cell activation status. Immunological markers were then related with on farm recorded parameters as milk electrical conductivity (MEC) and average milk flow rate (MFR). Composite milk samples were collected from 43 cows, nine of which had naturally infected udders and 34 of which had no infected udders. First, the milk samples were classified according to bacteriological test in positive and negative. The results showed that the negative samples to bacteriological test had: (i) significantly higher percentages of live lymphocytes; (ii) significantly lower percentages of CD11b[+] leukocytes; (iii) significantly lower MEC and higher MFR values. Then, samples were classified in three groups according to somatic cell count (SCC): Group A (n = 15), samples with SCC &#8804; 100,000 cells/mL, all negative to bacteriological analysis; Group B (n = 11), samples with 100,000 &lt; SCC &lt; 300,000 cells/m, with four samples positive to bacteriological analysis; Group C (n = 17), samples with SCC &#8805; 300,000 cell/mL with five samples positive to bacteriological analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to verify which flow cytometry immunological markers and on farm recorded parameters could better discriminate among the different groups of SCCs. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) indicated that 5 of the 10 parameters could best be used to reveal the differences between positive and negative samples among the considered groups of SCCs. Furthermore, the Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) indicated that composite milk samples with different SCC and infection status were clearly separated from each other in a two-dimensional space. In conclusion, the study highlighted that: (1) the conventional flow cytometry analysis applied on milk samples is a useful tool to investigate immunological parameters as potential indicators of udder health; (2) the combined evaluation of live milk leukocytes and recorded farm parameters could be useful to assess udder health status in dairy cows. The results obtained from this pilot study on few data require new and larger trials to be confirmed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32825152</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Training of Primary Chicken Monocytes Results in Enhanced Pro-Inflammatory Responses.</Title>	<Abstract>Beta-glucan-stimulated mammalian myeloid cells, such as macrophages, show an increased responsiveness to secondary stimulation in a nonspecific manner. This phenomenon is known as trained innate immunity and is important to prevent reinfections. Trained innate immunity seems to be an evolutionary conserved phenomenon among plants, invertebrates and mammalian species. Our study aimed to explore the training of primary chicken monocytes. We hypothesized that primary chicken monocytes, similar to their mammalian counterparts, can be trained with &#946;-glucan resulting in increased responses of these cells to a secondary stimulus. Primary blood monocytes of white leghorn chickens were primary stimulated with &#946;-glucan microparticulates (M-&#946;G), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), recombinant chicken interleukin-4 (IL-4) or combinations of these components for 48 h. On day 6, the primary stimulated cells were secondary stimulated with LPS. Nitric oxide (NO) production levels were measured as an indicator of pro-inflammatory activity. In addition, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to characterize the population of trained cells and to investigate the expression of surface markers associated with activation. After the secondary LPS stimulation, surface expression of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and the activation markers CD40 and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) was higher on macrophages that were trained with a combination of M-&#946;G and IL-4 compared to unstimulated cells. This increased expression was paralleled by enhanced NO production. In conclusion, this study showed that trained innate immunity can be induced in primary chicken monocytes with &#946;-glucan, which is in line with previous experiments in mammalian species. Innate immune training may have the potential to improve health and vaccination strategies within the poultry sector.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32825255</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Unraveling Honey Bee-Varroa destructor Interaction: Multiple Factors Involved in Differential Resistance between Two Uruguayan Populations.</Title>	<Abstract>The ectoparasite Varroa destructor is the greatest biotic threat of honey bees Apis mellifera in vast regions of the world. Recently, the study of natural mite-resistant populations has gained much interest to understand the action of natural selection on the mechanisms that limit the mite population. In this study, the components of the A. mellifera-V. destructor relationship were thoroughly examined and compared in resistant and susceptible honey bee populations from two regions of Uruguay. Mite-resistant honey bees have greater behavioral resistance (hygienic and grooming behaviors) than susceptible honey bees. At the end of the summer, resistant honey bees had fewer mites and a lower deformed wing virus (DWV) viral load than susceptible honey bees. DWV variant A was the only detected variant in honey bees and mites. Molecular analysis by Short Tandem Repeat showed that resistant honey bees were Africanized (A. m. scutellata hybrids), whereas susceptible honey bees were closer to European subspecies. Furthermore, significant genetic differentiation was also found between the mite populations. The obtained results show that the natural resistance of honey bees to V. destructor in Uruguay depends on several factors and that the genetic variants of both organisms can play a relevant role.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune stimulation capacity of a fully formulated diet with &#946;-1,3-1,6-glucans in cats, by assessing the rabies antibody titer after vaccination. Thirty-five healthy cats were recruited. The cats were placed into two groups and fed a standard diet in accordance with body weight. One group had the &#946;-glucans incorporated into the diet; the other group served as the control group. After two weeks of dietary adjustment; the rabies vaccine (Imrab[&#174;] 3 TF; Merial) was administered on days 0 and 21. Blood samples were taken on days 0, 21, and 42. Titers were determined with the rapid fluorescent foci inhibition test (RFFIT). Titers at days 21 and 42 were compared between the two groups in a linear mixed effects model. This study showed that the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had higher post-vaccination rabies antibody titers. This indicates that, in contrast to other animal species, the &#946;-glucan supplemented diet did not have the expected positive effect on the rabies antibody titers in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32867044</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A One-Health Model for Reversing Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) Decline.</Title>	<Abstract>Global insect decline impacts ecosystem resilience; pollinators such as honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) have suffered extensive losses over the last decade, threatening food security. Research has focused discretely on in-hive threats (e.g., Nosema and Varroa destructor) and broader external causes of decline (e.g., agrochemicals, habitat loss). This has notably failed to translate into successful reversal of bee declines. Working at the interdisciplinary nexus of entomological, social and ecological research, we posit that veterinary research needs to adopt a "One-Health" approach to address the scope of crises facing pollinators. We demonstrate that reversing declines will require integration of hive-specific solutions, a reappraisal of engagement with the many stakeholders whose actions affect bee health, and recontextualising both of these within landscape scale efforts. Other publications within this special issue explore novel technologies, emergent diseases and management approaches; our aim is to place these within the "One-Health" context as a pathway to securing honeybee health. Governmental policy reform offers a particularly timely pathway to achieving this goal. Acknowledging that healthy honeybees need an interdisciplinary approach to their management will enhance the contributions of veterinary research in delivering systemic improvements in bee health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In addition, three faculty members independently review and score subjective information in applicants' files (FileScore). The admissions committee determines a composite Admission Score (AdmScore), which is based on GPA, GPAScience, GPALast45hrs, GRE-QV, GRE-AW, and the FileScore. The AdmScore is generally perceived to be a good predictor of class rank at the end of year 1 (CREY1). However, this has not been verified, nor has it been determined which components of the AdmScore have the strongest correlation with CREY1. The present study therefore compared each component of the AdmScore for correlation with CREY1, for the three classes admitted in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (Class15, Class16, Class17). Results suggest that only a few components of the application file are needed to make strong predictive statements about the academic success of veterinary students during the first year of the curriculum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One-hundred and eight 1-day old COBB 500 broiler chickens were equally assigned to four experimental groups at random. In the control group (C) chicks were left untreated, whereas in groups LB and LBCj a suspension of L. fermentum was administered. A suspension of C. jejuni was subsequently applied to groups Cj and LBCj. Body weight was registered, and the individuals were later slaughtered; cecum samples were collected at 12, 36 and 48 h post-infection (hpi). The entire experiment lasted seven days. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine expression levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-15, IL-17, and IL-18 at each time point. Pathogen-infected individuals were observed to weigh significantly less than those fed with the probiotic. Significant differences were also found in transcript abundance; expression of IL-15 was downregulated by the probiotic and upregulated by C. jejuni. The effects of bacterial treatments were time-dependent, as the expression profiles differed at later stages. The present outcomes demonstrate that L. fermentum both reduces the impact of C. jejuni infection on chicken body weight and regulates positively pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, which ultimately increase bird well-being and improves production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32882787</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serological Evidence of Avian Influenza in Captive Wild Birds in a Zoo and Two Safari Parks in Bangladesh.</Title>	<Abstract>Avian influenza (AI) is endemic and frequently causes seasonal outbreaks in winter in Bangladesh due to high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2. Among avian influenza A viruses (AIV), H5, H7, and H9 subtypes have the most zoonotic potential. Captive birds in zoos and safari parks are used for educational, recreational, breeding, and conservational purposes in Bangladesh. To screen for AIV in captive birds to assess potential public health threats, we conducted a cross-sectional study in two safari parks and one zoo in Bangladesh for four months, from November to December 2013 and from January to February 2014. We collected blood samples, oropharyngeal, and cloacal swabs from 228 birds. We tested serum samples for AIV antibodies using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and AIV sero-subtype H5, H7, and H9 using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Swab samples were tested for the presence of avian influenza viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Across all the samples, AIV antibody prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI: 6.1-14.2, n = 228) and AIV HA subtype H5, H7 and H9 sero-prevalence was 0% (95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228), 0% (95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228) and 6.6% (95% CI: 3.72-10.6, n = 228), respectively. No AI viral RNA (M-gene) was detected in any swab sample (0%, 95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228). Birds in the Safari park at Cox's Bazar had a higher prevalence in both AIV antibody prevalence (13.5%) and AIV H9 sero-prevalence (9.6%) than any of the other sites, although the difference was not statistically significant. Among eight species of birds, Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) had the highest sero-positivity for both AIV antibody prevalence (26.1%) and AIV H9 prevalence (17.4%) followed by Golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) with AIV antibody prevalence of 18.2% and AIV H9 prevalence of 11.4%. Our results highlight the presence of AI antibodies indicating low pathogenic AIV mingling in captive birds in zoos and safari parks in Bangladesh. Continuous programmed surveillance is therefore recommended to help better understand the diversity of AIVs and provide a clear picture of AI in captive wild birds, enabling interventions to reduce the risk of AIV transmission to humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A cross-sectional study was conducted in the center, south and south-west regions of Cameroon in order to determine: the knowledge, skills and practices at risk of pig breeders; the prevalence of the disease in piggeries; the genome of the circulating virus. A total of 684 blood samples were collected in 209 farms for RT-PCR and ELISA analyses at the National Veterinary Laboratory (LANAVET) annex in Yaound&#233;. Prevalences of 15.2% (95CI: 12.5-17.9%) by ELISA, 23.8% (95CI: 20.6-27.0%) by RT-PCR, and 15.2% (95CI: 12.5-17.9%) by ELISA-PCR, were recorded. Of the farmers surveyed, 90% knew about the ASF and 55.3% have already experienced it. The 47.4% of them would not be able to recognize ASF if it occurred and, according to them, the risk of the disease introduction in farms would be 32% linked to the animal health personnel who work on farms. Molecular characterization revealed that only ASF genotype-I variable 19T-RSs is circulating. ASF is still hovering at a risky rate over the pig sector of Cameroon. The control of ASF needs an epidemiological surveillance, a better involvement of all stakeholders, sensitization of breeders and an effective State support for producers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While there are many studies on female fertility, only a few studies have focused on male fertility and the possible alterations of the reproductive system. The testes of 25 samples of adult drones of Apis mellifera ligustica were analyzed by histopathology using an innovative histological processing technique and the alterations that were found are here described. Most of the samples showed unaltered testes but, in some cases, samples showed degenerated seminiferous tubules, while others appeared immature. Although a limited number of samples were analyzed, the results obtained displayed that histopathological alterations of the testes exist also in honeybees and that more interest should be put to the matter, as honeybees could be considered as bioindicators for endocrine disruptors. Future studies on a larger number of samples are necessary to analyze how different environmental factors can act and induce alterations in the honeybee reproductive system.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As a treatment, only fumagillin is available, causing issues like resistance and hampered bee physiology. This study aimed to evaluate ApiHerb[&#174;] and Api-Bioxal[&#174;] as treatments against N. ceranae. The efficacy was tested using two qPCR methods based on the 16S rRNA and Hsp70 genes. In addition, these methods were compared for their aptitude for the quantification of the infection. For this, 19 colonies were selected based on the presence of N. ceranae infections. The colonies were divided into three groups: treated with ApiHerb, Api-Bioxal with previous queen caging and an untreated control. All colonies were sampled pre- and post-treatment. The bees were analyzed individually and in duplicate with both qPCR methods. All bees in the pre-treatment tested positive for N. ceranae. Both treatments reduced the abundance of N. ceranae, but ApiHerb also decreased the prevalence of infected bees. Analysis with the 16S rRNA method resulted in several orders of magnitude more copies than analysis with the Hsp70 method. We conclude that both products are suitable candidates for N. ceranae treatment. From our analysis, the qPCR method based on the Hsp70 gene results as more apt for the exact quantification of N. ceranae as is needed for the development of veterinary medicinal products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus are well-known avian haematozoa that can trigger decreased productivity and high mortality in domesticated birds. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of avian blood parasites (Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus) against 335 birds of 8 species in the Yazd province in central Iran. To detect blood parasites, Giemsa-stained blood smears were prepared. Of the birds, 11.64% (39/335) were infected with at least one parasite genus, particularly Haemoproteus (32.6%; 23/335). The total prevalence values for Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon were 1.7, 6.8 and 2.9%, respectively. Plasmodium had lower prevalence rates of 1.7% (6/335). Among birds, pigeons, hens and ducks have the highest prevalence of Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Plasmodium parasites at 1.7%, 6.8% and 2.9%, respectively. Results from this research extend our knowledge on the incidence of avian blood parasites in domesticated birds living in central Iran. The overall low incidence of avian blood parasites in birds was found in the Yazd province, Iran.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The prognosis of CanL depends on the severity of the clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities presented by the dog at the time of diagnosis. This study aims to estimate the survival time of dogs with CanL, determining the prognostic value of different clinical and clinicopathological parameters. Medical records of 99 dogs diagnosed with CanL in five veterinary centers of the Alentejo region (Portugal) were examined retrospectively. The majority of dogs presented hyperproteinemia, moderate normocytic normochromic anemia, normal blood urea and creatinine levels and were classified as stage 1 according to the International Interest Society (IRIS) guidelines at the time of diagnosis. The severity of anemia, presence of concomitant infectious diseases at the time of diagnosis and the anti-Leishmania therapy were correlated with the survival time. The influence of renal dysfunction was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and survival analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients classified as IRIS 1 at the time of diagnosis survived more than four years, in contrast with dogs classified as IRIS 2 that survived around two and half years and dogs classified as IRIS 3-4 that survived around one month. IRIS stage deteriorated during the course of CanL in one third of the dogs and was the principal cause of death or euthanasia in a high proportion of animals. In some cases, dogs did not receive anti-Leishmania treatment or abandoned the veterinary follow-ups, which may have considerable repercussions for animal wellbeing and public health. This study reinforces the value of blood urea and creatinine levels as prognostic factors in CanL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The identification of putative drug targets and vaccine candidates is crucial to control TBPs. No information has been recorded on designing novel drug targets and vaccine candidates based on proteins. Subtractive proteomics is an in silico approach that utilizes extensive screening for the identification of novel drug targets or vaccine candidates based on the determination of potential target proteins available in a pathogen proteome that may be used effectively to control diseases caused by these infectious agents. The present study aimed to investigate novel drug targets and vaccine candidates by utilizing subtractive proteomics to scan the available proteomes of TBPs and predict essential and non-host homologous proteins required for the survival of these diseases causing agents. Subtractive proteome analysis revealed a list of fifteen essential, non-host homologous, and unique metabolic proteins in the complete proteome of selected pathogens. Among these therapeutic target proteins, three were excluded due to the presence in host gut metagenome, eleven were found to be highly potential drug targets, while only one was found as a potential vaccine candidate against TBPs. The present study may provide a foundation to design potential drug targets and vaccine candidates for the effective control of infections caused by TBPs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32911615</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Epidemiological and Molecular Investigation of Ocular Fungal Infection in Equine from Egypt.</Title>	<Abstract>Diagnosis and treatment of ocular fungal infection in equine seems very challenging for owners and clinicians. The present study aimed to identify and characterize fungal species isolated from the eyes of clinically healthy and diseased equines (N = 100) from Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. The work also involved morphological and molecular characterization of the major fungal species. In addition, correlations between the occurrence of isolated fungi and some of the potential risk factors were also investigated. Interestingly, the prevalence rate of ocular mycosis in all examined equines in the study was 28% and there were major clinical signs associated with ocular fungal infection. Moreover, the identified fungal species included Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, Penicillium spp., Mucor spp., and Alternari spp. with a corresponding prevalence rate of 63.9%, 27.8%, 15.3%, 18.1%, 13.9%, and 4.2%, respectively, in healthy equine eyes, while their prevalence in diseased equine eyes was 57.1%, 32.1%, 21.4%, 7.1%, 3.6%, and 0%. Furthermore, a statistical significant association (p &lt; 0.05) was found between the frequency of isolation of A. fumigatus and Penicillium and several risk factors (breed, sex, and ground type), while the remaining risk factors and occurrence of fungi were not statistically correlated. A subset of the Aspergillus species samples positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were sequenced and their phylogenetic analysis identified three species of Aspergillus. Taken together, our study provides novel data related to the occurrence of ocular mycosis in equine in Egypt. Given the zoonotic potential of some identified fungi, our data may be helpful for implementation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for combating this sight-threatening infection in equine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease is endemic in small ruminants, cattle, and camels for decades, causing substantial economic losses in livestock production. However, a nationwide large-scale investigation of brucellosis in the small ruminant population has not been done in the past two decades. A serosurvey of sheep brucellosis in the five districts of Kuwait with most animal production farms was done between 2016 and 2019. In total, 67,054 serum samples from 233 sheep herds were collected and tested. Additionally, milk and tissue samples were collected from 46 seropositive cases for bacteriology. Thirty persons from seven seropositive farms were tested by serology. The incidence of seropositive cases was 7% in districts devoid of vaccination, while it was 4.7% in farms with history of vaccination. The serosurvey revealed that 89% of non-vaccinated herds (n = 181) were seropositive by Rose Bengal test (RBT), buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPAT), and complement fixation test (CFT). Prevalence of 100% was reported for non-vaccinated sheep herds from Al-Wafrah and Al-Jahra districts, followed by those from Al-Salmi (88.24%), Al-Abdali (86.7%) and Kabd (75.6%). Implementation of vaccination with B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine and test-and-slaughters in 20 herds reduced the seroprevalence to 33.3% and 25% in herds from Al-Jahra and AL-Wafrah, respectively. B. melitensis was isolated from 20 samples (43.5%). More than half of the examined animal owners (56.6%) tested positive for Brucella using RBT, BAPAT and CFT. The high numbers of infected herds and high prevalence in herdsmen are alarming. Thus, control measures have to be ensured immediately. The epidemiological situation in Kuwait is similar to those of the neighboring countries and the combined action of these states is needed. The understanding of the economic and public health impact of brucellosis in Kuwait needs to grow.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to determine the infection intensity, prevalence, and viability of N. ceranae in &gt;200 honey bee colonies during spring, summer, and fall, in a North American region. We also determined the relationship of N. ceranae infections with colony populations, food stores, bee survivorship, and overwinter colony mortality. The highest rates of N. ceranae infection, prevalence, and spore viability were found in the spring and summer, while the lowest were recorded in the fall. N. ceranae spore viability was significantly correlated with its prevalence and infection intensity in bees. Threshold to high levels of N. ceranae infections (&gt;1,000,000 spores/bee) were significantly associated with reduced bee populations and food stores in colonies. Furthermore, worker bee survivorship was significantly reduced by N. ceranae infections, although no association between N. ceranae and winter colony mortality was found. It is concluded that N. ceranae infections are highest in spring and summer and may be detrimental to honey bee populations and colony productivity. Our results support the notion that treatment is justified when infections of N. ceranae exceed 1,000,000 spores/bee.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Filets of the fish were prepared from market size African catfish with similar breeding history. Parameters of the processed filet under the different hydrothermal durations were also compared against a raw-unprocessed control group except during organoleptic analysis. The results obtained revealed a significant increase in protein, fat and ash content until the 30th minute of hydrothermal processing (p &#8804; 0.05). Beyond this processing time, protein and fat significantly reduced while ash remains unaffected. The same trend was observed for most essential/non-essential amino acids isolated as well as the prominent saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In all, the raw control group consistently recorded the least values of nutritional components. The perception of assessors was, however, found to be similar (p &#8805; 0.05) in terms of organoleptic parameters regardless of the duration of the processing time of the filets. It was concluded that cooking the African catfish filet using the hydrothermal method should not be extended beyond 30 min.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PFP is a complication of laparotomy in cattle, characterized by an accumulation of exudate inside a fibrinous capsule. We have studied 72 cases of PFP in Belgian blue cows, confirmed by a standard diagnostic protocol. Blood was collected to evaluate the presence of antibodies for Mycoplasma bovis(M. bovis), Coxiella burnetii(C. burnetii) and Bovine Herpesvirus 4(BoHV4) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Peritoneal exudate was obtained from the PFP cavity to perform bacteriological culture, and to identify the DNA of M. bovis, C. burnetii and BoHV4 using real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bacteriological culture was positive in most peritoneal samples (59/72); Trueperella pyogenes (T. pyogenes) (51/72) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) (20/72) were the most frequently identified. For BoHV4, the majority of cows showed positive serology and qPCR (56/72 and 49/72, respectively). Contrariwise, M. bovis (17/72 and 6/72, respectively) and C. burnetii (15/72 and 6/72, respectively) were less frequently detected (p &lt; 0.0001). Our study proves that PFP can no longer be qualified as a sterile inflammation. Moreover, we herein describe the first identification of BoHV4 and C. burnetii in cows affected by PFP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess how steerable instruments ameliorate the efficacy of suturing in comparison with the traditional instrument, and a combination instruments, performed by experienced and novice surgeons. The study was performed by three experienced surgeons and three novice surgeons. The instruments employed were divided into three surgical sets: two steerable dissectors; one steerable dissector and one straight needle; two straight needle holders. The study supervisor recorded the total time for the procedure, the number of bites completed, the time for each bite, and the quality of the procedure. In our study, we found consistent data demonstrating that experienced laparoscopists completed the prescribed suture pattern with more bites in less time than novices. The use of two steerable instruments was more time consuming than standard straight instruments, but a combination of instruments was significantly less time consuming, as was the use of two straight needle holders. This result was even observed in novice surgeons. Combining a steerable instrument with a traditional straight needle holder provided more advantages in this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Understanding the ecological interactions between Varroa and honeybees is fundamental for reducing mite impact in apiaries. This work assesses bee colonies with various Varroa infestation levels in apiaries to determine: (1) the relationship between multi-infested brood cells and brood infestation level, (2) the damage caused by Varroa to parasitized honey bee pupae, and (3) mite reproduction rate at various infestation levels. Data were collected from 19 worker brood combs, each from a different colony, ranging from 160 to 1725 (mean = 706) sealed cells per comb. Mite distribution was aggregated, ranging from about 2% to 74% infested cells per comb. The percentage of cells invaded by one, two, three, four, or more than four foundress mites, as a function of infestation level, was estimated by five highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) second-degree polynomial regression equations. The correction factors found could increase the precision of prediction models. Varroa fertility and adult bee longevity decreased as multi-infestation levels increased, and the implications of this relationship are discussed. Finally, these findings could improve sampling methods and the timing of mite treatments in apiaries, thus favoring sustainable management strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is a dearth of information on infectious diseases that affect these animals. At present, there has been no recording in the literature on diseases of mammary tissue in these animals. This case reported on the abnormal mammary enlargement of a four year old female agouti post-partum. Blood, milk and tissue samples were taken for diagnostics to determine the cause of disease. Histological samples confirmed the swelling of the mammary gland as a diffuse mammary hyperplasia. Hematological values obtained were within the reference range of agoutis reared in captivity. The milk samples that were taken cultured Staphylococcus spp. in one mammary gland (left inguinal). The cultured bacteria in the milk samples confirmed this animal had mastitis. The bacterial cultured (Staphylococcus aureus) was sensitive to tetracyclines, ampicillin, trivetrin and ceftiofur. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first record in the literature on mastitis in the agouti. Thus, this information will add to the knowledge of diseases in captive reared agoutis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Likewise, FMD can spread to cattle farms via vehicles contaminated with the FMD virus. In Northern Thailand, the movement of manure transport vehicles and the circulation of manure bags among cattle farms are considered as potential risk factors for FMD outbreaks among cattle farms. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and movement patterns of manure tradesman using social network analysis. A structured questionnaire was used to identify sequences of farms routinely visited by each tradesman. A total of 611 participants were interviewed, including 154 beef farmers, 407 dairy farmers, 36 tradesmen, and 14 final purchasers. A static weighted directed one-mode network was constructed, and the network metrics were measured. For the manure tradesman-cattle farmer network, the tradesman possessed the highest value of in- and out-degree centralities (71 and 4), betweenness centralities (114.5), and k-core values (2). These results indicated that the tradesman had a high frequency of farm visits and had a remarkable influence on other persons (nodes) in the network. The movement of vehicles ranged from within local districts, among districts, or even across provinces. Unclean manure plastic bags were circulated among cattle farms. Therefore, both vehicles and the bags may act as a disease fomite. Interestingly, no recording system was implemented for the movement of manure transport vehicles. This study suggested that the relevant authority and stakeholders should be aware of the risk of FMD spreading within this manure trading network. The findings from this study can be used as supporting data that can be used for enhancing FMD control measures, especially for FMD endemic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While experimental data are crucial in understanding declines, insights can be gained from models of honey bee populations. We add the influence of the V. destructor mite to our existing honey bee model in order to better understand the impact of mites on honey bee colonies. Our model is based on differential equations which track the number of bees in each day in the life of the bee and accounts for differences in the survival rates of different bee castes. The model shows that colony survival is sensitive to the hive grooming rate and reproductive rate of mites, which is enhanced in drone capped cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32971754</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Identifying Sources of Potential Bias When Using Online Survey Data to Explore Horse Training, Management, and Behaviour: A Systematic Literature Review.</Title>	<Abstract>Owner-reported behavioural observations form an essential part of the veterinarians' diagnosis and treatment plan. The way we train and manage horses affects their behaviour and, in turn, their health and welfare. Current horse training and management practices are largely driven by traditional techniques and longstanding methodologies. These approaches generally lack an evidence base for evaluation purposes. The absence of evidence and evaluation contributes to the persistent use of risky practices and this, in turn, increases risk of potential harms for both horse and rider, and fuels questioning of the equine industry's current social license to operate. Objective evidence is required to make training and management decisions based on demonstrable best practice. Large-scale experimental or intervention studies using horses are generally not practical because of the associated costs and logistics of gaining ethical approval. Small studies generally lack statistical power and are subject to the effects of many forms of bias that demand caution in the interpretation of any observed effects. An alternative to collecting large amounts of empirical data is the use of owner-reported observations via online survey. Horse owners are ideally placed to report on the domestic equine triad of training, management, and behaviour. The current article highlights three sources of potential bias in a systematic review of literature on large-scale online studies of horse owners' observational reports that met the following selection criteria: English-language, published, peer-reviewed articles reporting on studies with over 1000 respondents and open access to the survey instrument. The online surveys were evaluated for three common forms of bias: recall, confirmation, and sampling bias. This review reveals that online surveys are useful for gathering data on the triad of horse training, management, and behaviour. However, current use of online surveys to collect data on equitation science (including horse training, management, and behaviour) could be improved by using a standardised and validated tool. Such a tool would facilitate comparisons among equine and equitation science studies, thus advancing our understanding of the impacts of training and management on horse behaviour. The authors of the current review suggest the use of a standardised behavioural and management assessment tool for horses. Such a tool would help define what constitutes normal behaviour within geographically disparate populations of horses, leading to improvements in rider safety and horse welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In humans, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed as a promising marker of IBD. This study evaluated the possible clinical and prognostic significance of the NLR in dogs with IBD. This retrospective study enrolled 41 dogs diagnosed with IBD presented to University of Pisa from January 2017 to January 2018. For each dog, age, sex, canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI), endoscopic and histopathological grading were recorded. Complete blood count, serum total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein at the time of endoscopy were recorded. A control group (CG) of healthy dogs from a blood donor database was built. NLR was calculated for both IBD and CG as the ratio between absolute neutrophils and lymphocytes. Presence of crypt distension, lacteal dilation (LD), mucosal fibrosis, intraepithelial lymphocytes was recorded. Follow-up information was obtained from electronic medical records and dogs were classified as responders and non-responders based on CCECAI variation between admission and the first recheck. IRE dogs showed higher NLR compared to healthy dogs. NLR correlated negatively with total protein, albumin, and cholesterol and correlated positively with CCECAI. Dogs with LD showed higher NLR than dogs without LD. Non-responders showed higher NLR compared to responders. In conclusion, as in IBD human patients, the NLR acts as an inflammatory marker providing further information on severity of the disease and could be useful in predicting treatment response.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two different syndromes, with paralysis, ataxia and flight incapacity on one hand and black hairless individuals with shortened abdomens on the other, can affect a colony simultaneously. This case report presents two Apis mellifera carnica colonies with symptoms of paralysis and hairless black syndrome in 2019. Via RT-PCR, a highly positive result for CBPV was detected in both samples. Further problems, such as a Nosema infection and Varroa infestation, were present in these colonies. Therapy methods were applied to colony 1 comprising queen replacement, shook swarm method and Varroa control, whereas colony 2 was asphyxiated after queen loss and colony weakening. After therapy, colony 1 was wintered without symptoms. Beekeeping and sanitary measures can save a CBPV-infected colony, while further complications result in total colony loss.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Insight into the physiology and pathogenesis of S. suis undoubtedly contributes to the control of its infection. During the infection process, a wide variety of virulence factors enable S. suis to colonize, invade, and spread in the host, thus causing localized infections and/or systemic diseases. Enzymes catalyze almost all aspects of metabolism in living organisms. Numerous enzymes have been characterized in extensive detail in S. suis, and have shown to be involved in the pathogenesis and/or physiology of this pathogen. In this review, we describe the progress in the study of some representative enzymes in S. suis, such as ATPases, immunoglobulin-degrading enzymes, and eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase, and we highlight the important role of various enzymes in the physiology and pathogenesis of this pathogen. The controversies about the current understanding of certain enzymes are also discussed here. Additionally, we provide suggestions about future directions in the study of enzymes in S. suis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the affected tissue revealed atypical cells of suspected malignant mesenchymal tumor origin. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ill-demarcated soft tissue mass in the left retrobulbar space extending into the nasal cavity and into the frontal lobes of the brain with destruction of the adjacent cribriform plate and the basisphenoid bone. Histopathological features of the tumor were consistent with the diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and desmin and negative for S100. These findings were mostly consistent with leiomyosarcoma arising from the smooth muscle on the retrobulbar tissues. Primary retrobulbar leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor in dogs. To expand our knowledge of retrobulbar leiomyosarcoma in dogs, we have described its clinical, diagnostic imaging, histopathological, and immunohistochemical characteristics in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The oesophageal pH in anaesthetised dogs undergoing endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract (END group; n = 12) or orthopaedic surgery (ORT group; n = 12) was measured using an oesophageal probe. The dogs were sedated with acepromazine or with methadone or butorphanol, and anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Of the 24 dogs in this study, 21 (87.5%) had an episode of GER during anaesthesia. The incidence of GER, as well as the first, the minimum, and the maximum pH values, did not differ significantly between the groups. The mean maximum difference versus the first pH value was higher for dogs in the END group (-2.6 &#177; 3.5) as compared with those in the ORT group (-0.7 &#177; 2.5), although they were not statistically significant (p = 0.25). The administration of methadone or butorphanol had no significant effect on the development of acidic reflux or biliary reflux. In the acepromazine-sedated dogs, the incidence of GER did not differ significantly between patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure and those undergoing orthopaedic surgery; however, during endoscopy, fluctuations in the oesophageal pH can be expected, even without any clinical signs of GER.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, osteosarcomas are a rare form of sarcoma with high death rates in humans and dogs. miRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The discovery of miRNAs could give a contribute in the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of tumors in animal species, as already in humans. The differentiated expression of miRNAs is a frequent finding in cancers and is related to their pathogenesis in many cases. Most canine and human sarcomas show similar miRNA aberrations. Lower levels of miR-1 and miR-133b in canine osteosarcoma tissues were found to increase tumorigenesis through a higher expression of their target genes MET and MCL1. The overexpression of miR-9 promotes a metastatic phenotype in canine osteosarcomas and its capacity as a prognostic biomarker for the disease is currently being evaluated. MicroRNAs at the 14q32 locus could be used as prognostic biomarkers, since their decreased expression has been associated with poor prognosis in canine and human osteosarcomas. Furthermore, a decreased expression of miR-34a in osteosarcoma tumour cells has been associated with shorter disease-free survival times and its reintroduction as a synthetic prodrug shows good potential as a novel therapeutic target to fight the disease. Circulating miR-214 and miR-126 are significantly increased in a broad-spectrum cancer and have the ability to successfully predict the prognosis of dogs. However, further studies are needed to make the use of miRNAs as biomarkers a common practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of the most frequent renal US abnormalities in dogs at different stages of CKD, and to investigate their association with CKD International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stages. Medical records and ultrasonographical report of 855 dogs were retrospectively included. The most frequent renal ultrasonographic abnormalities were: increased cortical echogenicity, abnormal ratio of cortico-medullary junction (C/M) and pyelectasia. A statistically significant difference in the prevalence of irregular contour, abnormal cortico-medullary junction, abnormal C/M, increased cortical echogenicity, and pyelectasia was found for dogs at different IRIS stages. The number of dogs with more than one US abnormality increased significantly with the progression of IRIS stage. In conclusion, increased cortical echogenicity, abnormal C/M junction and pyelectasia were the most prevalent US abnormalities in our CKD population. Although none of the US abnormalities showed a significantly higher prevalence, the number of dogs presenting &gt; 3 US abnormalities increased significantly from IRIS 2 to IRIS 4. Renal US is an excellent ancillary diagnostic test, which should be used together with renal functional parameters, to monitor the progression of CKD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33019533</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effects of Early Nutrition and Sanitary Conditions on Oral Tolerance and Antibody Responses in Broiler Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Greater antigenic exposure might accelerate activation and maturation of the humoral immune system. After hatch, commercial broiler chickens can have early (EN) or delayed (DN) access to nutrition, up to 72 h after hatch. The immune system of EN versus DN broilers is likely more exposed to antigens after hatch. This might contribute to activation and maturation of the immune system, but might also influence the development of oral tolerance, thereby altering later life antibody responses. We studied antibody (IgM, IgY, IgA) responses between 21 and 42 d of age in fast-growing EN and DN broilers, kept under low (LSC) or high sanitary conditions (HSC). In a first experiment (n = 51 broilers), we tested whether early oral exposure to bovine serum albumin (BSA) affected later life antibody responses towards BSA and a novel antigen-rabbit &#947;-globulin (RGG), under HSC. In a second experiment, a total of 480 EN and DN broilers were housed under either LSC or HSC, and we studied antibody responses against both BSA and RGG (n = 48 broilers per treatment) and growth performance. Broilers kept under LSC versus HSC, had higher antibody levels and their growth performance was severely depressed. Interactions between feeding strategy (EN versus DN) and sanitary conditions, or main effects of feeding strategy, on natural and specific antibody levels, and growth performance were not observed. Levels of IgA were elevated in EN versus DN broilers, in experiment I and in batch 2 of experiment II, but not in the other batches of experiment II. We concluded that EN versus DN contributes minimally to the regulation of antibody responses, irrespective of antigenic pressure in the rearing environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33019544</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Co-Produced Care in Veterinary Services: A Qualitative Study of UK Stakeholders' Perspectives.</Title>	<Abstract>Changes in client behaviour and expectations, and a dynamic business landscape, amplify the already complex nature of veterinary and animal health service provision. Drawing on prior experiences, veterinary clients increasingly pursue enhanced involvement in services and have expectations of relationship-centred care. Co-production as a conceptualisation of reciprocity in service provision is a fundamental offering in the services sector, including human medicine, yet the role of co-production in veterinary services has been minimally explored. Utilising a service satisfaction framework, semi-structured interviews (n = 13) were completed with three veterinary stakeholder groups, veterinarians, allied animal health practitioners, and veterinary clients. Interview transcript data were subject to the qualitative data analysis techniques, thematic analysis and grounded theory, to explore relationship-centred care and subsequently conceptualise co-production service for the sector. Six latent dimensions of service were emergent, defined as: empathy, bespoke care, professional integrity, value for money, confident relationships, and accessibility. The dimensions strongly advocate wider sector adoption of a co-produced service, and a contextualised co-production framework is presented. Pragmatic challenges associated with integration of active veterinary clients in a practitioner-client partnership are evident. However, adopting a people-centric approach to veterinary services and partnerships with clients can confer the advantages of improved client satisfaction, enhanced treatment adherence and outcomes, and business sustainability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33022909</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>CD4[+]CD25[+] Cells Are Essential for Maintaining Immune Tolerance in Chickens Inoculated with Bovine Serum Albumin at the Late Stage of Embryonic Development.</Title>	<Abstract>In this study, the role of chicken CD4[+]CD25[+] cells during induced immunotolerance was tested. Properties of chicken CD4[+]CD25[+] cells sorted by flow cytometry were analyzed. Results showed that chicken CD4[+]CD25[+] cells express IL-10, TGF-&#946; highly and suppress proliferation of CD4[+]CD25[-] cells in vitro. To induce immunotolerance, embryos were inoculated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) via an intravascular route on embryo incubation day 20 (EID20), and after hatching chicks experienced BSA immunization four times at 7-day intervals. Serum anti-BSA antibodies and CD4[+]CD25[+] cell ratio was analyzed. Results showed that humoral tolerance was obtained and the CD4[+]CD25[+] cell percentage in peripheral blood lymphocytes increased along with this progress. Injection of anti-chicken CD25 antibody via an intravascular route on EID16 is applied to block CD4[+]CD25[+] cells, and the CD4[+]CD25[+] cell ratio decreased significantly up to 35 d post-hatch. Based on the above, injections of anti-chicken CD25 antibody on EID16 and BSA on EID20 were carried out sequentially, and tolerance level was contrasted to the BSA-injection group. Data revealed the anti-BSA antibodies increased significantly in the CD4[+]CD25[+] cell-blocked groups indicating that immune tolerance level was weakened. In conclusion, chicken CD4[+]CD25[+] cells are essential in maintaining induced immune tolerance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33050260</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Roughage to Concentrate Ratio and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Inclusion Could Modulate Feed Digestion and In Vitro Ruminal Fermentation.</Title>	<Abstract>The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of the roughage-to-concentrate (R:C) ratio and the addition of live yeast (LY) on ruminal fermentation characteristics and methane (CH4) production. The experimental design was randomly allocated according to a completely randomized design in a 4 &#215; 4 factorial arrangement. The first factor was four rations of R:C at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, and 20:80, and the second factor was an additional four doses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (live yeast; LY) at 0, 2.0 &#215; 10[6], 4.0 &#215; 10[6], and 6.0 &#215; 10[6] colony-forming unit (cfu), respectively. For the in vitro method, during the incubation, the gas production was noted at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The rumen solution mixture was collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of incubating after inoculation. Cumulative gas production at 96 h was highest in the R:C ratio, at 20:80, while the addition of LY improves the kinetics and accumulation of gas (p &gt; 0.05). Maximum in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) at 24 h after incubation were achieved at the R:C ratio 20:80 and the addition of LY at 6 &#215; 10[6] cfu, which were greater than the control by 13.7% and 12.4%, respectively. Ruminal pH at 8 h after incubation decreased with an increased proportion of concentrates in the diet, whereas it was lowest when the R:C ratio was at 20:80. Increasing the proportion of a concentrate diet increased total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) and propionic acid (C3), whereas the acetic acid (C2) and C2-to-C3 ratios decreased (p &lt; 0.05). TVFA and C3 increased with the addition of LY at 6 &#215; 10[6] cfu, which was greater than the control by 11.5% and 17.2%, respectively. No interaction effect was observed between the R:C ratio and LY on the CH4 concentration. The calculated ruminal CH4 production decreased with the increasing proportion of concentrates in the diet, particularly the R:C ratio at 20:80. The CH4 production for LY addition at 6 &#215; 10[6] cfu was lower than the control treatment by 17.2%. Moreover, the greatest populations of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi at 8 h after incubation were found with the addition of LY at 6 &#215; 10[6] cfu, which were higher than the control by 19.0%, 20.7%, and 40.4%, respectively. In conclusion, a high ratio of roughage and the concentrate and addition of LY at 6.0 &#215; 10[6] cfu of the total dietary substrate could improve rumen fermentation, improve feed digestibility, and reduce the CH4 production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33050372</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Carprofen Permeation Test through Porcine Ex Vivo Mucous Membranes and Ophthalmic Tissues for Tolerability Assessments: Validation and Histological Study.</Title>	<Abstract>Carprofen (CP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is profusely used in veterinary medicine for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Some undesirable effects are associated with its systemic administration. Alternative local routes are especially useful to facilitate its administration in animals. The main aim of this paper is to validate the suitability of ex vivo permeation experiments of CP with porcine mucous membranes (buccal, sublingual and vaginal) and ophthalmic tissues (cornea, sclera and conjunctiva) intended to be representative of na&#239;ve in vivo conditions. Chromatographic analysis of CP in membrane-permeated samples and drug-retained have been validated following standard bioanalytical guidelines. Then, recovery levels of drugs in tissue samples were assessed with aqueous phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer to preserve the histological integrity. Finally, as a proof of concept, a series of CP permeation tests in vertical Franz diffusion cells has been performed to evaluate permeation flux and permeability constants in all tissues, followed by a histological study for critical evaluation. Furthermore, synthetic tissue retention-like samples were prepared to verify the value of this experimental study. Results show linear relationships with good determination coefficient (R[2] &gt; 0.998 and R[2] &gt; 0.999) in the range of 0.78 to 6.25 mg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL to 100 mg/mL, respectively. Low limits of quantification around 0.40 &#181;g/mL were allowed to follow permeation levels until a minimum of 0.40% of the locally-applied dose. This method showed a good accuracy and precision with values lower than 2%. After the recovery technique, reproducible values below 30% were achieved in all tissues, suggesting it is a non-damaging method with low efficiency that requires the use of further solvents to enhance the extraction percentages. After permeation and histology tests, no relevant peak interferences were detected, and no cell or tissue damage was found in any tissue. In conclusion, results demonstrate the suitability of this test to quantify the distribution of CP with good histological tolerability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33050516</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Humoral Immune Responses to Burkholderia pseudomallei Antigens in Captive and Wild Macaques in the Western Part of Java, Indonesia.</Title>	<Abstract>Burkholderia pseudomallei, the Gram-negative bacterium which causes melioidosis, is a threat to human and a wide range of animal species. There is an increased concern of melioidosis in Indonesian primate facilities, especially following case reports of fatal melioidosis in captive macaques and orangutans. Our preliminary serosurveillance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to B. pseudomallei lipopolysaccharide showed that a significant number of captive and wild macaques in the western part of Java, Indonesia, have been exposed to B. pseudomallei. To better characterize the humoral immune response in those animals, a panel of assays were conducted on the same blood plasma specimens that were taken from 182 cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) and 88 pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina) reared in captive enclosures and wild habitats in the western part of Java, Indonesia. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in this study were conducted to detect IgG against B. pseudomallei proteins; alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp1), and putative outer membrane porin protein (OmpH). The performances of those immunoassays were compared to ELISA against B. pseudomallei LPS, which has been conducted previously. Seropositivity to at least one assay was 76.4% (139/182) and 13.6% (12/88) in cynomolgus macaques and pig-tailed macaques, respectively. Analysis of demographic factors showed that species and primate facility were significant factors. Cynomolgus macaques had higher probability of exposure to B. pseudomallei. Moreover, macaques in Jonggol facility also had higher probability, compared to macaques in other facilities. There were no statistical associations between seropositivity with other demographic factors such as sex, age group, and habitat type. There were strong positive correlations between the absorbance results of AhpC, HcpI, and OmpH assays, but not with LPS assay. Our analysis suggested that Hcp1 assay would complement LPS assay in melioidosis serosurveillance in macaques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recently, new Leptospira hosts were identified, including also marine mammals. Moreover, halotolerant Leptospira strain, isolated from the environment and animals, highlighted the capability of this microorganism to persist in the seawater. The aim of this research was to investigate the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of salt on Leptospira strains belonging to 16 different serovars. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were verified through the microdilutions method starting from a 20% sodium chloride concentration. MIC values obtained were between 0.3125% and 10% of salt, while MBC values between 0.625% and &gt;20%. Icterohaemorrhagiae (MIC: 0.3125%; MBC: 0.625%) resulted the most inhibited serovar, while the most resistant was Tarassovi (MIC: 10%; MBC: &gt;20%). Interestingly, trends were reported for Pomona (MIC: 1.25%; MBC: &gt;20%) and Bratislava (MIC: 0.625%; MBC: 20%), highlighting low MIC values but high MBC values. This is the first investigation aimed at the in vitro effect of salt on the growth of Leptospira spp. reference strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method is essential for early detection to facilitate treatment. This study was conducted to develop E. canis loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, a highly sensitive yet simple molecular technique, targeting the citrate synthase (gltA) gene of E. canis. Canine blood samples were subjected to conventional PCR targeting E. canis gltA. After analysis of the sequences of PCR amplicons, LAMP primers were generated. The optimum temperature and time for the LAMP assay were determined using eight samples-after which, the effectiveness and reproducibility of LAMP were verified by testing 40 samples, which included PCR-positive and negative samples. The detection limit was also established. The optimal condition for the assay was 61 &#176;C for 60 min. Compared to PCR, the LAMP assay had a relative sensitivity and specificity of 92.5 and 100%, respectively. Statistical analysis using McNemar's test showed that the E. canis LAMP assay has no significant difference with PCR. Therefore, the LAMP assay developed in this study may be used as an alternative to PCR in the detection of E. canis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We collected ticks in a mountain and in a periurban park, from vegetation and different animal sources, and we sampled tissues from wild boar. Dermacentor marginatus (n = 121) was collected in both study areas, on vegetation, humans, and animals, while D. reticulatus (n = 13) was exclusively collected on wild boar from the periurban area. Rickettsia slovaca and Candidatus Rickettsia rioja infected 53.1% of the ticks, and R. slovaca was also identified in 11.3% of wild boar tissues. Bartonella spp. and Francisella tularensis were not detected, however, Francisella-like endosymbionts infected both tick species (9.2%). Our findings provide new insights on the current distribution of Dermacentor spp. and their infection with a spotted-fever group rickettsiae in the Alps region. Wild boar seem to play a major role in their eco-epidemiology and dispersion in the study area. Although further studies are needed to assess the burden of rickettsial diseases, our results highlight the risk of contracting SENLAT infection through Dermacentor spp. bites in the region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As they are familiar with multifactorial health problems in single animals as well as in herd health management, their knowledge and skills can be beneficial for the beekeepers and honeybee health. However, in education and in practice, honeybees are not a common species for most veterinarians and the typical veterinary diagnostic methods such as blood sampling or auscultation are not applicable to the superorganism honeybee. Honeybee colonies may be affected by various biotic and abiotic factors. Among the infectious agents, RNA-viruses build the largest group, causing covert and overt infections in honeybee colonies which may lead to colony losses. Veterinarians could and should play a more substantial role in managing honeybee health-not limited to cases of notifiable diseases and official hygiene controls. This review discusses the veterinary diagnostic approach to adult bee examination with a special focus on diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the common virus diseases Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV)-Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV)-Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV)-Complex, Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), as well as coinfections like Varroa spp. and Nosema spp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cause of this condition remains unclear but clinical studies revealed that following IV administration of OTC a relaxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint occurs in foals affected by flexural deformity. Studies concluded that OTC administration in neonatal foals did not adversely affect the kidneys. Other adverse effects of OTC have never been reported. This report presents two cases with different outcomes of 3-day-old foals which presented acute collapse and progressive depression after OTC administration. The clinical aspects, the increased activity of serum enzymes indicative of muscular damage, the presence of myoglobin in urine were clear diagnostic indicators of severe rhabdomyolysis, and the gross and histological findings confirmed a myopathy associated with renal damage in one case. Adverse effects on the musculoskeletal and urinary systems in healthy foals were first reported and were probably associated with multiple doses administered to foals less than 24-48 h old and/or at dosing intervals less than 24-48 h. The risk of development of rhabdomyolysis and nephrotoxicity in neonatal foals treated with OTC for flexural deformity from now on should be considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The inflamed endometrium responds by activating an inflammatory intracellular signaling cascade that leads to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress is closely related to several pathological conditions in perinatal dairy cows and play a key role in tissue damage. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a natural phenolic alcohol with a strong antioxidant activity, displayed a wide range of biological effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of HT in an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in bovine uterine endometrial cells. Our results showed that HT had a significant protective effect in LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. HT was also able to increase the capacity of endogenous antioxidant systems through the up-regulation of the NRF2 pathway. Furthermore, HT restored the tight junction protein expressions. In conclusion, our results showed the protective effects of HT in LPS-stimulated BEND cells. Therefore, the results of this study suggest an important protective role of HT in the treatment and prevention of uterine pathologies in dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is caused by the obligatory intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus Sarcocystis. Besides its public health issues, sarcocystosis results in significant economic losses due to its impact on productivity and milk yield. A wide range of final and intermediate hosts have been identified, including mammals, birds, and reptiles; however, few studies have investigated the contribution of camels to maintaining the epidemiological foci of the disease in countries such as Egypt. The present study was conducted to grossly and histopathologically identify the prevalence rate of Sarcocystis spp. in camels (N = 100) from the Aswan Governorate, Egypt. Furthermore, the major risk factors related to the development of sarcocystosis in camels were investigated. Samples from the diaphragm, cardiac muscle, esophagus, and testes of the slaughtered camels were collected. Interestingly, Sarcocystis was detected in 75% of the examined camels. Following the studied variable factors, camels aged 5 years or more were found to be at higher risk, with an infection rate of 87.7% (57 of 65) than those younger than 5 years. The infection rate was 81.4% (57 of 70) in males and 60% (18 of 30) in females. The esophagus was the most affected organ (49%), followed by the diaphragm (26%) and cardiac muscle (17%), whereas none of the testes samples were affected. Taken together, the present study demonstrates the high prevalence of Sarcocystis in the examined camels and suggests the importance of these animals in preserving the epidemiological foci of sarcocystosis in Egypt. Future research should map the circulating strains in Egypt and aim to raise public health awareness about the importance of sarcocystosis and other related zoonotic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dairy cow sera with a total of 1236 samples from 44 farms were tested with the two tests to detect immune responses against the HS. Percentages of positive samples for the ELISA and IHA tests were 73% (901/1236) and 70% (860/1236), respectively. Estimated sensitivity and estimated specificity of the ELISA test were 90.5% (95% posterior probability interval (PPI) = 83.2-95.4%) and 70.8% (95% PPI = 60.8-79.8%), respectively. Additionally, estimates for the Se and Sp values of the IHA test were 77.0% (95% PPI = 70.8-84.1%) and 51.1% (PPI = 36.8-66.3%), respectively. The estimated prevalence of the disease was 71.7% (95% PPI = 62.7-82.6%). These results demonstrate that the ELISA test can be a useful tool for the detection of the presence of an antibody against the HS in dairy cows. Notably, the cows in this area indicated a high percentage of exposure to Pasteurella multocida.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To detect WNV and other flavivirus infections in wild resident and migratory birds, we tested 184 samples from 19 identified species within nine families collected during 2012-2016 from four districts in Bangladesh. We tested serum samples for the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against WNV using competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (c-ELISA), whereas tracheal and cloacal swabs were subjected to consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (c-PCR) for the detection of the flavivirus RNA. Overall, we detected 11.9% (n = 22; 95% CI: 0.07-0.16) samples were seropositive, including 15.9% in the migratory wild birds and 10.7% in the resident wild birds. The migratory wild Tufted duck showed 28.5% seropositivity, whereas the resident wild house crows showed 12.5% seropositivity. None of the swab samples was positive for flavivirus RNA infection (0%, n = 184; 95% CI: 0-0.019). These study findings recommend continued surveillance for early detection and to better understand the epidemiology of WNV and other flavivirus circulation in both birds and mosquitoes in Bangladesh.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33138252</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Geographic Distribution of Ehrlichia canis TRP Genotypes in Brazil.</Title>	<Abstract>Tandem repeat proteins (TRPs) are major immunoreactive proteins of Ehrlichia canis, which have been used in the serological diagnosis of different genotypes of the microorganism. TRP19 is preserved among different E. canis isolates expressed on both reticulate and dense-core cells and observed in the extracellular matrix or associated with the morula membrane. TRP36 is differentially expressed only on the surface of the dense-core form of the bacterium and exhibits more divergence among isolates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of the American (USTRP36), Brazilian (BrTRP36) and Costa Rican (CRTRP36) genotypes of E. canis in Brazil, using ELISA assays. Serum samples of 814 dogs from 49 municipalities from all over Brazil were analyzed. Our results showed that 33.9% of the samples were reactive to the USTRP36 genotype and 32.6% to the BrTRP36 genotype. The two genotypes appeared to occur equally throughout Brazil, although the frequency of seropositivity was lower in the south than in the country's other regions. Dogs that reacted to at least one of the synthetic peptides (TRP19 and TRP36) were 456 (56%). A few dogs (n = 5; 0.6%) reactive to the E. canis TRP36 genotype (CRTRP36) were also detected in the northeast and southern regions. We concluded that the American and Brazilian genotypes of E. canis are distributed evenly in Brazil, especially in the tropical region, while the temperate region in the south presented the lowest prevalence rates. This study offers the first report of dogs seropositive for the Costa Rican genotype in Brazil.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of the present study was to assess the presence of ten EHEC, EPEC, and/or STEC O serotypes (O5, O26, O80, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145, O157, and O165) in calves sampled via recto-anal mucosal swabs (RAMS) at three dairy farms in Belgium. A total of 233 RAMS were collected on three consecutive occasions from healthy &lt;6-month-old Holstein-Friesian calves and submitted to a PCR targeting the eae, stx1, and stx2 genes after non-selective overnight enrichment growth. The 148 RAMS testing positive were streaked on four (semi-)selective agar media; of the 2146 colonies tested, 294 from 69 RAMS were PCR-confirmed as EHEC, EPEC, or STEC. The most frequent virulotype was eae+ EPEC and the second one was stx1+ stx2+ STEC, while the eae+ stx1+ and eae+ stx1+ stx2+ virulotypes were the most frequent among EHEC. The majority of EHEC (73%) tested positive for one of the five O serotypes detected (O26, O103, O111, O145, or O157) vs. 23% of EPEC and 45% of STEC. Similarly, more RAMS (73%) harbored EHEC isolates positive for those five serotypes compared to EPEC (53%) or STEC (52%). This survey confirms that (i) healthy young dairy calves are asymptomatic carriers of EHEC and EPEC in Belgium; (ii) the carrier state rates, the virulotypes, and the identified O serotypes differ between farms and in time; and (iii) a majority of EPEC belong to so far unidentified O serotypes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33142815</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>On the Importance of the Sound Emitted by Honey Bee Hives.</Title>	<Abstract>Recent years have seen a worsening in the decline of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) colonies. This phenomenon has sparked a great amount of attention regarding the need for intense bee hive monitoring, in order to identify possible causes, and design corresponding countermeasures. Honey bees have a key role in pollination services of both cultivated and spontaneous flora, and the increase in bee mortality could lead to an ecological and economical damage. Despite many smart monitoring systems for honey bees and bee hives, relying on different sensors and measured quantities, have been proposed over the years, the most promising ones are based on sound analysis. Sounds are used by the bees to communicate within the hive, and their analysis can reveal useful information to understand the colony health status and to detect sudden variations, just by using a simple microphone and an acquisition system. The work here presented aims to provide a review of the most interesting approaches proposed over the years for honey bees sound analysis and the type of knowledge about bees that can be extracted from sounds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

BVDV is a significant animal pathogen causing substantial economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide through respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and abortion or birth of persistently infected calves. While the immunogenic profile of some of the BVDV proteins (i.e., E[rns], E2 and NS3) is well established during viral pathogenesis, very little information is available about most of BVDV's non-structural proteins in this regard. In recent times, the NS4B protein has emerged as an interesting target of diagnostic, vaccination and therapeutic value in viral infections of other members of the family Flaviviridae due to its key scaffold-like contribution in the viral replication complex. Although, BVDV-NS4B has a membrane topology alongside its role in induction of autophagosomes in vitro. However, information on its immunogenicity during BVDV pathogenesis and vaccination is scarce. To characterize the immunogenic profile of the NS4B, five cows were vaccinated with the live attenuated BVDV vaccine Bovela[&#174;] and blood samples were taken pre- and post-immunization for serum isolation. Virus neutralization assay (VNA) confirmed the presence of anti-BVDV antibodies in the sera of vaccinated cows. VNA also revealed pre-existing antibodies against BVDV in the pre-immunization sera of two cows. To identify BVDV-NS4B specific antibodies, the NS4B protein was expressed in mammalian cells by using the pCI-neo vector system. The sera from BVDV vaccinated cows were evaluated for the presence of BVDV-NS4B specific antibodies through western blot and indirect ELISA. Interestingly, t sera from cows with pre-existing immunity against BVDV were able to detect NS4B in western blot and ELISA, suggesting the presence of NS4B-specific antibodies. The obtained results provide the first indication of the immunogenic nature of BVDV-NS4B protein in sero-converted animals. These findings are consistent with the observation made for NS4B in other Flaviviridae members and confirm this protein as an interesting target with diagnostic, vaccination and therapeutic value.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33143134</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Factors Associated with Honey Bee Colony Losses: A Mini-Review.</Title>	<Abstract>The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a species of crucial economic, agricultural and environmental importance. In the last ten years, some regions of the world have suffered from a significant reduction of honey bee colonies. In fact, honey bee losses are not an unusual phenomenon, but in many countries worldwide there has been a notable decrease in honey bee colonies. The cases in the USA, in many European countries, and in the Middle East have received considerable attention, mostly due to the absence of an easily identifiable cause. It has been difficult to determine the main factors leading to colony losses because of honey bees' diverse social behavior. Moreover, in their daily routine, they make contact with many agents of the environment and are exposed to a plethora of human activities and their consequences. Nevertheless, various factors have been considered to be contributing to honey bee losses, and recent investigations have established some of the most important ones, in particular, pests and diseases, bee management, including bee keeping practices and breeding, the change in climatic conditions, agricultural practices, and the use of pesticides. The global picture highlights the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor as a major factor in colony loss. Last but not least, microsporidian parasites, mainly Nosema ceranae, also contribute to the problem. Thus, it is obvious that there are many factors affecting honey bee colony losses globally. Increased monitoring and scientific research should throw new light on the factors involved in recent honey bee colony losses. The present review focuses on the main factors which have been found to have an impact on the increase in honey bee colony losses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Knowledge of the causative microorganisms, the cure rates achievable in the field and essential associated factors are crucial for proper control. The objectives of the present study were to characterize clinical mastitis cases in Germany and to analyze factors influencing cure rates and the recurrence rate. Milk samples of every clinical mastitis case occurring on 12 participating farms were examined cytomicrobiologically. Post-treatment quarter samples were taken after 14 and 21 days. Treatments were performed according to existing farm protocols. Of 2883 clinical mastitis cases, the most prevalent pathogens were Streptococcus (S.) uberis (20.2%) and coliforms (11.6%). In 35% of the milk samples, no bacteriological growth was detected. The overall bacteriological cure rate was 73.3%, while the cytological cure rate was 22.3%, the full cure rate 21.4% and the recurrence rate 18.8%. Regarding the pathogen distribution of severe mastitis, coliform bacteria were detected in 30.5% of the cases, whereas S. uberis was detected in 26.5% thereof. The results show that severe mastitis is caused almost as frequently by Gram-positive as by Gram-negative microorganisms. The low cytological cure rates show that the therapy needs to be further developed with regard to calming the inflammation. The obtained data can be very helpful in assessing internal mastitis scenarios and the effect of measures and therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the hematological and serum chemistry profile of 10 free-ranging captured crested porcupines was established for the first time. The mean hematological values resulted: 5.7 SD 0.4 M/&#956;L for red blood cells; 13.6 SD 0.8 g/dL for hemoglobin; 77.3 SD 5.7 fL for mean corpuscular volume and 30.1 SD 4.7 g/dL for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; 14.4 SD 7.2 K/&#956;L for white blood cells; and 557.0 SD 469.9 K/&#956;L for platelets. The mean urea and creatinine values resulted with 19.8 SD 8.3 mg/dL and 1.6 SD 3.0 mg/dL, respectively. The mean value of total protein was 6.7 SD 1.0 g/dL, with values of albumin higher than globulins. The mean activity of creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase was 927.3 SD 607.6 U/L, 199.2 SD 70.8 U/L, 16.9 SD 13.7 U/L, and 256 SD 75.8 U/L, respectively. Highest values of alkaline phosphatase were recorded in two porcupines presenting severe injuries with clear signs of infection. These preliminary results may be a helpful tool in order to assess porcupine health status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33182568</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Isolation and Histopathological Changes Associated with Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria in Lymph Nodes Condemned at a Bovine Slaughterhouse.</Title>	<Abstract>Background: non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infect humans and animals and have a critical confounding effect on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. The Official Mexican Standard (Norma Oficial Mexicana, NOM-ZOO-031-1995) for food safety regulates Mycobacterium bovis in cattle, but not the NTM species. The study's objective was to isolate and identify the NTM present in condemned bovine lymph nodes in a slaughterhouse, characterize the histological lesions, and correlate bacteriological and microscopic findings with the antemortem tuberculin skin test. Methods: from 528 cattle, one or two pooled samples of lymph nodes from each animal were cultured for Mycobacteria spp. and processed for histopathology. Results: mycobacteria were isolated from 54/528 (10.2%) of the condemned lymph nodes; 25/54 (46.2%) of these isolates were NTM; 4 bacteriological cultures with fungal contamination were discarded. Granulomatous and pyogranulomatous inflammation were present in 6/21 (28.6%) and 7/21 (33.3%) of the NTM-positive lymph nodes, respectively. The species of NTM associated with granulomatous lymphadenitis were M. scrofulaceum, M. triviale, M. terrae, and M. szulgai, while those causing pyogranulomatous lesions were M. szulgai, M. kansasii, M. phlei, and M. scrofulaceum. Conclusions: the NTM infections can cause false-positive results in the tuberculin test because of cross immune reactivity and interference with the postmortem identification of M. bovis in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Out of 1316 isolates in dogs, 771 were Staphylococcus spp. distributed as follows: Staph. pseudointermedius (n = 406), Staph. intermedius (n = 160), Staph. aureus (n = 104), and Staph. coagulase-negative (n = 101). In common, all Staphylococcus spp. showed a high prevalence (20-50%) of resistance to ampicillin, cephalosporin, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfonamide, but a low prevalence (1-10%) of resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate. With regards to the other families of bacteria, the number of antimicrobials for which resistance was high (&gt;20%) in dogs was: Enterobacteriaceae (7/12), Enterococcus spp. (10/16), E. coli (11/15), Pseudomonas spp. (10/13), and Streptococcus spp. (4/9). For urinary tract infections caused by E. coli or Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.), amikacin and florfenicol were the only drugs that demonstrated 100% in vitro efficacy. Multi-drug resistance was observed in 18.7% (246/1316) and 22% (21/97) of the isolates from dogs and cats, respectively. Except for Pseudomonas spp., known for intrinsic resistance, resistance in other bacteria was likely attributed to high selection pressure. In conclusion, empirical antimicrobial use cannot be recommended to treat most common infections, and selection should be based on results from susceptibility testing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both bacteria are associated with significant economic losses in the cattle industry due to high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in the case of severe infections. The objectives of the present study were to perform serotyping and genotyping, as well as characterization of the virulence-associated genes in 48 bacterial isolates; 33 P. multocida and 15 M. haemolytica. All strains were isolated from pneumonic cattle calves showing respiratory manifestations such as fever, nasal discharges, and rapid breathing in North Upper Egypt governorates (Beni-Suef and El-Fayoum). PCR was applied as a confirmatory test using a specific universal gene, kmt1, and rpt2 for P. multocida and M. haemolytica, respectively. The results show that 29 (87.9%) P. multocida and 15 (100%) M. haemolytica isolates were positive for the corresponding universal gene. The results of serotyping indicate that 86.2% of P. multocida isolates belonged to serotype B:2, while 13.8% were untyped. Meanwhile, 60% and 40% of M. haemolytica isolates belonged to serotype 2 and serotype 1, respectively. Investigation of virulence-associated genes showed that all the tested P. multocida isolates harbored nanB, omp87, and toxA genes. Four M. haemolytica isolates harbored both gcp and lktC genes and of these, three isolates harbored the ssa gene. Sequencing of toxA gene of P. multocida and lktC gene of M. haemolytica in the current strains indicated a great homology with strains uploaded in gene banks from different hosts and localities worldwide.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood, milk, and tissue samples were spiked with B. abortus biovar 1 (B01988-18 strain) to determine the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The 95% limit of detection of the ITS qPCR assay was highest in tissue, followed by blood, then milk, i.e., 0.48, 4.43, and 15.18 bacteria/PCR reaction, respectively. The diagnostic performance of the assay was compared to the Brucella cell surface protein (BCSP) 31 qPCR assay and bacterial culture. Out of 56 aborted foetal tissue samples from bovine, ovine, and caprine, 33% (19/56) were positive for Brucella spp. The sensitivity and specificity of the ITS qPCR assay was 87% and 95% respectively, compared to 92% and 89% for the BCSP31 qPCR assay and 47% and 55% for bacterial culture, respectively. The assay was efficient, sensitive, and specific, making it a valuable tool in the early detection of the Brucella pathogen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Italy, the development of donkey farms is mainly due to growing request of donkey milk, which is considered an incomparable substitute for human mother's milk for its chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of AFM1 in donkey milk produced in a farm in Northern Italy, also in view of the few data available about the presence of this mycotoxin in this type of milk. Therefore, 63 milk samples were collected and analyzed using a fast and sensitive HPLC and fluorescence detection (FLD) method previously optimized and validated. None of the milk samples collected were found to be contaminated at a level above the limit of quantification (LOQ) (0.0125 ng/mL), while only one sample showed traces of the mycotoxin at a concentration between the limit of detection (LOD) and LOQ (0.0044 ng/mL), well below the legal limit established for infant milk and follow-on milk (0.025 ng/mL). These results are in line with those of the few similar surveys carried out on donkey milk and seem to indicate a low risk of AFM1 contamination for this food.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infestations can result in anemia, alopecia, emaciation, and death. Most notably, the winter tick has caused negative impacts to moose (Alces alces) populations in the northeast United States and Canada. Winter ticks have been identified on other cervid species, including deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), which generally results in low tick burdens and mild or no disease. Recently, however, a wild yearling bull elk in Pennsylvania was found dead as a result of severe winter tick infestation. To obtain baseline data on winter ticks in wild elk in Pennsylvania, we collected 1453 ticks from 190 hunter-harvested wild elk between 2017-2018. Of the 204 harvested elk, 94.3% (190/204) had ticks collected for this study and none of the sampled elk had evidence of winter-tick associated disease. The average tick burden was 7.7 ticks/elk and average winter tick load on all elk was 0.5. Results of this study indicate that winter ticks do infest wild elk in Pennsylvania. However, during the fall months, the tick burden is low and rarely associated with lesions. These data herein serve as a baseline to monitor winter tick populations over time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We reported recently that horse encode unique gene and protein sequences for the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca[2+]-transporting ATPase (SERCA) and the regulatory subunit sarcolipin (SLN). Here we quantified gene transcription and protein expression of SERCA and its inhibitory peptides in horse gluteus, as compared to commonly-studied rabbit skeletal muscle. RNA sequencing and protein immunoblotting determined that horse gluteus expresses the ATP2A1 gene (SERCA1) as the predominant SR Ca[2+]-ATPase isoform and the SLN gene as the most-abundant SERCA inhibitory peptide, as also found in rabbit skeletal muscle. Equine muscle expresses an insignificant level of phospholamban (PLN), another key SERCA inhibitory peptide expressed commonly in a variety of mammalian striated muscles. Surprisingly in horse, the RNA transcript ratio of SLN-to-ATP2A1 is an order of magnitude higher than in rabbit, while the corresponding protein expression ratio is an order of magnitude lower than in rabbit. Thus, SLN is not efficiently translated or maintained as a stable protein in horse muscle, suggesting a non-coding role for supra-abundant SLN mRNA. We propose that the lack of SLN and PLN inhibition of SERCA activity in equine muscle is an evolutionary adaptation that potentiates Ca[2+] cycling and muscle contractility in a prey species domestically selected for speed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Limited treatments are available, although new antiparasitics and immunomodulators are pursued. Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) has a broad antimicrobial spectrum, including antiparasitic activity. Here, we evaluated the potential for Toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) and PHMB alone, and as polyplex nanoparticles containing PHMB and TLR4 or TLR9 agonists, to selectively kill L. infantum. Susceptibility of L. infantum promastigotes to PHMB, miltefosine, and allopurinol was performed, and the half-maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined. Then, DH-82 cells were infected and treated with PHMB alone or combined with TLR4a (MPLA-SM) or TLR9a (CpG ODNs) and allopurinol alone. The IC50 values of L. infantum promastigotes were PHMB (1.495 &#181;M), miltefosine (9.455 &#181;M), and allopurinol (0.124 &#181;M). After infection, treated DH-82 cells displayed a lower percentage (p = 0.0316), intensity (p = 0.0002), and index of infection (p = 0.0022) when compared to non-treated cells. PHMB induced lower percentage of infection alone (p = 0.043), in combination with TLR9a (p = 0.043), and with TLR4a (p = 0.0213). Supernatants were collected and used to measure TNF-&#945; and IL-6 levels. Increased TNF-&#945; was observed after PHMB plus TLR4a, relative to uninfected and infected untreated macrophages (p = 0.043). PHMB combined with TLR4a shows promise as a potential anti-L. infantum drug combination, as well as inducer of proinflammatory response, as demonstrated by decreased infection and increased TNF-&#945; production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate and monitor the ultrasonographic changes observed in dogs with clinically suspected AP on consecutive AUEs. The study population was constituted by 38 client-owned dogs hospitalized for no less than 48 h from January 2016 to December 2019. Dogs included in this study were suspected of AP based on the clinical examination and abnormal rapid specific canine pancreatic lipase test performed at admission. Dogs were submitted to two AUEs, the first on the first day of hospitalization, and the second between 40-52 h after the first one. Twelve dogs had both AUEs suggestive of AP. Fourteen dogs received an ultrasonographic diagnosis of AP exclusively on the second AUE. Twelve dogs remained negative on both the first and the second AUE. In 26 out of 38 patients the second AUE was suggestive of AP. If a patient is suspected of AP, it is advisable to carry out ultrasonographic monitoring at least within the first 52 h after admission, since ultrasonographic signs of AP may only become observable later after hospitalization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To battle the increasing emergence of virulent microbes, novel mitigation strategies are needed. One strategy being considered to combat pathogens is antimicrobial compounds produced by microbes, coined microcins. However, effectors for microcin production are poorly understood, particularly in the context of complex physiological responses along the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Previously, we identified an E. coli competitor capable of producing a strong diffusible antimicrobial with microcin-associated characteristics. Our objective was to examine how molecule production of this competitor is affected by physiological properties associated with the GIT, namely the effects of carbon source, bile salt concentration and growth phase. Using previously described liquid- and agar-based assays determined that carbon sources do not affect antimicrobial production of E. coli O103F. However, bile salt concentrations affected production significantly, suggesting that E. coli O103F uses cues along the GIT to modulate the expression of antimicrobial production. Furthermore, E. coli O103F produces the molecule during the exponential phase, contrary to most microcins identified to date. The results underscored the importance of experimental design to identify producers of antimicrobials. To detect antimicrobials, conventional microbiological methods can be a starting point, but not the gold standard.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this investigation, the antibacterial activity of 41 honey samples from different Ukraine regions has been evaluated. For each honey, melissopalynological and physico-chemical analysis were performed in order to determine botanical origin, pH, glucose and fructose contents and free acidity. So, antibacterial activity against Staphylococcusaureus CCM 4223, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium CCM 3807 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was assessed through the determination of MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) values by the microdilutions method. The results show that the most susceptible bacterial strain was L. monocytogenes. Its growth was inhibited at a honey concentration ranging from 0.094 to 0.188 g/mL. The most resistant bacterial strain was S. aureus. As concerns MBC values, L. monocytogenes was the most susceptible bacteria, while S. aureus was the most resistant. Helianthus spp. honeys was the most effective against all tested bacterial strains, followed by Robinia spp. and multifloral honeys. Promising results for MIC tests have been found for Brassica spp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, early symptoms are often overlooked because the affected animals first appear completely asymptomatic. Alterations from anatomical reference lines according to B&#246;hmer and Crossley applied to standard skull X-ray images, have been shown to be indicative of tooth health problems in pet rabbits. Despite its proven usefulness, there are exceptions in which the anatomical reference lines appear not to be suitable for application. We addressed this issue by quantifying the cranial morphology of a large data set of pet rabbit patients (N = 80). The results of the morphometric analyses revealed considerable diversity in skull shape among the typical pet rabbits, but variance in only a few parameters influences the applicability of the anatomical reference lines. The most substantial parameter is the palatal angle. Specimens in which the anatomical reference lines could not be applied, have a rather large angle between the skull base and the palatal bone. We recommend to measure the palatal angle before applying the anatomical reference lines for objective interpretation of dental disease. Pet rabbits with a palatal angle larger than 18.8&#176; are not strictly suitable for the successful application of the anatomical reference lines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to describe the electrocardiographic patterns in bitches affected by closed cervix pyometra, to assess the clinical relevance of electrocardiographic changes with the occurrence of pyometra, and to relate their severity with laboratory and clinical findings. A total of 39 bitches with closed cervix pyometra and 10 healthy female dogs were included in this study. During the hospitalization, bitches underwent a complete physical examination. An electrocardiographic examination before the ovariohysterectomy was performed. Blood samples for biochemical and hematological analysis were also evaluated. Bitches suffering pyometra at least one arrhythmia 31/39 (79.4%), sinus tachycardia (22/39, 56.4%), ventricular premature complexes (9/39, 23%), increased amplitude of T wave (7/39, 17.9%), ST depression (4/39, 10.2%), second-degree atrioventricular block (2/39, 5.1%), increase of QT interval (2/39, 5.1%), sinus bradycardia (2/39, 5.1%), and first-degree atrioventricular block (1/39, 2.5%). Some bitches were also detected with low wave amplitude (17/39, 43.5%). Cardiac arrhythmias associated with canine pyometra are frequent events. These data suggest that arrhythmias may be the consequence of one or more factors that can occur during pyometra, such as myocardial damage, electrolyte/metabolic disorders, and/or sepsis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>33255168</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Hepatogenous Photosensitivity Outbreak after Coccidiosis in Grazing Holstein Steers.</Title>	<Abstract>Clinical signs of photosensitivity in cattle can occur sporadically and unpredictably. It is believed that cases of photosensitivity may be underreported, causing inaccurate and inflated reports of mortality. Additionally, because secondary photosensitization in grazing cattle occurs with liver damage or dysfunction, photosensitivity can have many potential or associated causes. This case links a previous occurrence of coccidiosis to an outbreak of photosensitivity in grazing Holstein steers. Grazing management staff first observed clinical signs of photosensitivity 17 days after an outbreak of coccidiosis and subsequent turnout to spring pastures. Clinical signs were observed in 25% of the population. The severity of photosensitivity was variable and ranged from blistered skin on the muzzle to sloughing of unpigmented epidermis and thinly haired regions. Severely affected cattle were removed from pasture, housed under shade, monitored for infection, and recovered without treatment. Mild cases remained on pasture and recovered without treatment. Photosensitivity did not reoccur in the cattle that remained on pasture or in mildly affected cattle returned to pasture. Photosensitivity did not appear to be associated with pasture weeds, a specific forage species, or variable or extreme weather conditions that could have resulted in mycotoxin production. The occurrence appears to have been a result of a previous and concurrent coccidiosis outbreak that caused secondary photosensitization through hepatic lipidosis caused by anorexia and dehydration associated with the severe coccidiosis. Although clinical signs appeared suddenly, cattle recovered quickly and without treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infectious diseases can therefore significantly impact the economy and welfare. Despite infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) being present, the knowledge of their epidemiology and impact is extremely limited. In the present work, a cross-sectional study based on 500 tracheal swabs collected from 50 intensive and backyard unvaccinated flocks of the Jimma Zone was performed to investigate the circulation of these viruses and molecularly characterize them. IBV and aMPV presence was tested by molecular assays, and genotyping was carried out on positive samples. Accordingly, 6% (95% CI 2.06% to 16.22%) and 8% (95% CI 3.15% to 18.84%) of flocks tested IBV and aMPV positive, respectively. Particularly, IBV 793B (GI-13) strains were detected in backyard flocks only, and identical or closely related sequences (p-distance &lt;2%) were detected in distantly spaced flocks, suggesting relevant viral circulation. On the contrary, both backyard and intensive flocks were affected by aMPV subtype B. Potential epidemiological links associated to the importation of parental birds from foreign countries could be established. These results highlight non-negligible circulation of these viruses, warranting further epidemiological studies and the evaluation of control measure implementation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is now recognized that several foodborne pathogens originate from wildlife as demonstrated by recent global disease outbreaks. Zoonotic spillover events are closely related to the ubiquity of parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens present within human and animal populations and their surrounding environment. Foodborne diseases have economic and international trade impacts, incentivizing effective wildlife disease management. In North America, there are no food safety standards for handling and consumption of free-ranging game meat. Game meat consumption continues to rise in North America; however, this growing practice could place recreational hunters and game meat consumers at increased risk of foodborne diseases. Recreational hunters should follow effective game meat food hygiene practices from harvest to storage and consumption. Here, we provide a synthesis review that evaluates the ecological and epidemiological drivers of foodborne disease risk in North American hunter populations that are associated with the harvest and consumption of terrestrial mammal game meat. We anticipate this work could serve as a foundation of preventive measures that mitigate foodborne disease transmission between free-ranging mammalian and human populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pigs play an important role in IV ecology as the "mixing vessel," since they can be infected by swine, avian and human IV, allowing the appearance of new subtypes. Human viruses originated in swine are known as IV of swine origin or swine influenza virus (SwIV) variants. In this study, we identified knowledge tendencies of SwIV and assessed potential bias in the literature caused by these variants. We identified the most mentioned SwIV variants and manually reviewed the literature to determine the number of publications applying the whole influenza nomenclature, a partial nomenclature, only the subtype or mixed terminology, along with the proportion of articles in which the GenBank ID number was available. We observed that the 2009 H1N1 human pandemic created an important bias in SwIV research driven by an increase in human publications on the IV of swine origin. H1N1 is the most studied subtype for swine and humans, followed by H3N2. We found differences between the nomenclatures applied, where partial classifications were slightly more common. Finally, from all the publications, only 25% stated the GenBank ID of the sequence studied. This review represents the most complete exploration of trends in SwIV knowledge to date and will serve as a guidance for future search strategies in SwIV research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Developing effective methods of differential diagnostics is of high fundamental and applied importance. The pathogenesis of diseases of the digestive tract of horses accompanied by the development of inflammation and oxidative stress, can be associated with a lack of the nitrogen monoxide which controls many signaling pathways in the body. The level of the nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the regulation of the immune and nervous systems, the tone of all the blood vessels, and the courses of many pathological processes. The nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase (sGC) and leads to vascular relaxation. The aim of this investigation was to study the metabolites of nitric oxide in horses suffered from intestinal diseases. The levels of nitric oxide in the blood serum of horses depending on their age and health state was studied. The concentration of nitrites in the blood serum of horses aged 6-25 years was 3.4 &#177; 4.2 &#956;M, and in the young horses (1-5 years) the level of this indicator was 8.2 &#177; 5.4 &#956;M. A sharp decrease in nitrite was observed in all the horses with intestinal diseases of 2 &#177; 0.9 &#956;M, especially with tympanitic caecun of 0.6 &#177; 0.4 &#956;M and with spasmodic colic of 1.8 &#177; 0.5 &#956;M. The level of nitrosylhemoglobin HbNO in the blood of the diseased animals was higher than that in clinically healthy horses, regardless of age.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Logistic regression is a statistical technique used to explain relationships between data categories and outcomes and is increasingly being applied in medicine for predicting disease probability based on medical and patient variables. Our aims were to evaluate histologic features of canine and feline bladder diseases and explore the utility of logistic regression modeling in identifying associations in veterinary histopathology, then formulate a predictive disease model using urinary bladder as a pilot tissue. The histologic features of 267 canine and 71 feline bladder samples were evaluated, and a logistic regression model was developed to identify associations between the bladder disease diagnosed, and both patient and histologic variables. There were 102 cases of cystitis, 84 neoplasia, 42 urolithiasis and 63 normal bladders. Logistic regression modeling identified six variables that were significantly associated with disease outcome: species, urothelial ulceration, urothelial inflammation, submucosal lymphoid aggregates, neutrophilic submucosal inflammation, and moderate submucosal hemorrhage. This study demonstrated that logistic regression modeling could provide a more objective approach to veterinary histopathology and has opened the door toward predictive disease modeling based on histologic variables.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the last years, their use has been introduced in veterinary medicine, too. The study of the antibacterial properties of EOs is of increasing interest, because therapies with alternative drugs are welcome to combat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains. Other issues could be resolved by EOs employment, such as the presence of antibiotic residues in food of animal origin and in environment. Although the in vitro antimicrobial activity of EOs has been frequently demonstrated in studies carried out on bacterial and fungal strains of different origins, there is a lack of information about their effectiveness in treating infections in animals. The scientific literature reports some studies about in vitro EOs' activity against animal clinical bacterial and fungal isolates, but in vivo studies are very scanty. The use of EOs in therapy of companion and farm animals should follow careful studies on the toxicity of these natural products in relation to animal species and route of administration. Moreover, considering the different behavior of EOs in relation to both species and strain pathogen, before starting a therapy, an aromatogram should be executed to choose the oil with the best antimicrobial activity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An injection dose of 7-8 mg/kg of tiletamine-zolazepam has been proven to be an effective and safe immobilizing mixture for crested porcupines under field conditions. However, the occurrence of long immobilization and recovery times, with high excitement and convulsion during awakening, were recorded. In order to reduce such side effects after recovery, the effectiveness of a lower dosage (4-6 mg/kg) of tiletamine-zolazepam (Zoletil[&#174;]) was tested. The results obtained confirm that the use of tiletamine-zolazepam in crested porcupine immobilization provides a quick induction, wide safety margin, and predictable awakening under field conditions. A smaller injection dosage of 5 mg/kg has been proven to be sufficient to ensure a short induction time (average: 7.1 min), with good muscle relaxation and little excitement of the animals during awakening. The lower dosage of tiletamine-zolazepam, while providing a shorter recovery time (average: 53.6 min), proves to be adequate for standard handling procedures. Furthermore, the smaller amount of tiletamine-zolazepam also ensures safe immobilization for pregnant individuals and porcupettes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to identify intestinal strongyle genera in 55 naturally infected donkeys from three different farm typologies in Tuscany, central Italy, using morphological and metrical analysis of third stage larvae (L3) obtained from faecal cultures. Larvae were identified using two previous reported morphological identification keys. Moreover, eggs per gram (EPG) data were also evaluated to assess differences, if any, according to the farm typology, sex, and age of the examined donkeys. The results showed that small strongyles were prevalent in all donkey farms. In all examined farms, most (92-100%) of L3 were identified as cyathostomin species of the genera Cylicocyclus spp. and Cylicostephanus spp. Large strongyles of the genera Strongylus spp. and Triodontophorus spp., were identified at low percentage (8%), only in the single organic farm included in the study. A high agreement was observed between the two different morphometric keys used. No significant differences were found for EPG according to farm typology, and sex and age from the examined donkeys. This is the first report about genera identification of intestinal strongyles infecting donkeys in Tuscany, Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study investigated the correlation and defined the relationship between easily obtainable external landmark variables in the dog; occipital-coccygeal length (OCL) and ilium wings distance (IWD), with the skin to epidural and intrathecal space distances using computed tomography (CT). The CT images of 86 dogs of different breeds were examined in this retrospective observational study. Images of dogs in sternal recumbency were optimized to the sagittal view. The distances between the skin and lumbosacral epidural space (LSE) and skin to sacrococcygeal space (SCE) were measured to the ligamentum flavum surrogate (LFS) line. The distance between the skin and the intrathecal space (ITS) was measured from the skin to the vertebral canal at the interlumbar (L5-L6) space. Measurements of the IWD and OCL were performed on dorsal and scout views, respectively. Linear regression equations and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated between variables. Data were reported as mean (standard deviation). Significance was set as alpha &lt; 0.05. After exclusion of four dogs, 82 CT scans were included. The depths were LSE 45 (15) mm, SCE 23 (10) mm, and ITS 50 (15) mm. There was a moderate correlation between OCL with LSE (=14.2 + OCL * 0.05 (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001)), and a strong correlation with ITS (=11.4 + OCL * 0.07 (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.0001)), while a very weak correlation was found with SCE (=14.0 + OCL * 0.02 (r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.0584)). Similarly, with IWD, there was a moderate correlation with LSE (=10.8 + IWD * 0.56 (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.0001)), and strong correlation with ITS (=9.2 + IWD * 0.67 (r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.0001)), while a weak correlation was found with SCE (=11.2 + IWD * 0.2 (r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.0033)). Mathematical formulae derived from the multiple regression showed that the body condition score (BCS) improved the relationship between IWD and OCL and the LSE, SCE and ITS, while the addition of body weight was associated with multicollinearity. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of the algorithms to demonstrate their ability for prediction in a clinical setting.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Few studies have investigated the involvement of &#945;2-adrenoceptor in decreased tear flow; the issue has not been illustrated sufficiently. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of different doses of atipamezole on the reversal of medetomidine-induced tear-flow decrease to reveal the specific involvement of &#945;2-adrenoceptor. Treatment with 400, 800, or 1600 &#181;g/kg atipamezole (or saline as the control) was intramuscularly administered to rats 15 min following intramuscular administration of 200 &#181;g/kg medetomidine. After medetomidine administration, tear flow was measured using a phenol red thread test (PRTT). PRTT values decreased significantly after 200 &#181;g/kg medetomidine administration. The PRTT values after 800 (optimal dose to reverse) and 1600 &#181;g/kg atipamezole administration reached baseline, but never exceeded it significantly. Treatment with 400 &#181;g/kg atipamezole also reversed the decrease in PRTT value but the PRTT remained lower than baseline. The optimal dose and the higher dose of atipamezole fully reversed the medetomidine-induced decrease in tear flow to the baseline level in rats, while the lower dose of atipamezole partially recovered tear flow.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several studies in the companion animals field have already investigated the fecal microbiome in healthy or sick subjects; however, the methodologies used in the different laboratories and the limited number of animals recruited in each experiment do not allow a straight comparison among published results. Previously, our research focused on the characterization of the microbial taxa variability in 340 fecal samples from 132 healthy dogs, collected serially from several in-house experiments. The results supported the responsiveness of microbiota to dietary and sex factors and allowed us to cluster dogs with high accuracy. For the present study, intestinal and blood microbiota of healthy dogs from different breeds, genders, ages and food habits were collected, with three principal aims: firstly, to confirm the results of our previous study regarding the fecal microbiome affected by the different type of diet; secondly, to investigate the existence of a blood microbial population, even in heathy subjects; and thirdly, to seek for a possible connection between the fecal and the blood microbiota. Limited researches have been published on blood microbiota in humans, and this is the first evidence of the presence of a bacterial population in the blood of dogs. Moreover, gut and blood microbiota can discriminate the animals by factors such as diet, suggesting some relationship between them. These preliminary results make us believe in the use of the blood microbiome for diagnostic purposes, such as researching and preventing gut inflammatory diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Those stressors could be affecting key semiochemicals, which act as homeostasis regulators in Apis mellifera colonies, such as cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) involved in social recognition and ethyl oleate (EO) which plays a role as primer pheromone in honey bees. Here we test the effect of amitraz, coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and flumethrin, commonly applied to treat varroosis, on honey bee survival time, rate of food consumption, CHC profiles and EO production on N. ceranae-infected and non-infected honey bees. Different sublethal concentrations of amitraz, coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and flumethrin were administered chronically in a syrup-based diet. After treatment, purified hole-body extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. While N. ceranae infection was also shown to decrease EO production affecting survival rates, acaricides showed no significant effect on this pheromone. As for the CHC, we found no changes in relation to the health status or consumption of acaricides. This absence of alteration in EO or CHC as response to acaricides ingestion or in combination with N. ceranae, suggests that worker honey bees exposed to those highly ubiquitous drugs are hardly differentiated by nest-mates. Having determined a synergic effect on mortality in worker bees exposed to coumaphos and Nosema infection but also, alterations in EO production as a response to N. ceranae infection it is an interesting clue to deeper understand the effects of parasite-host-pesticide interaction on colony functioning.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study assesses welfare on 25 extensively managed pastoral New Zealand beef farms, and explores the relationship between welfare and reproductive performance. Relationships between welfare measures and key reproductive performance indicators (pregnancy rate, weaning rate, mating period and bull: cow ratio) are investigated using an exploratory principal components analysis and linear regression model. Seven welfare measures (thinness, poor rumen fill, dirtiness, blindness, mortality, health checks of pregnant cows and yarding frequency/year) showed a potential influence on reproductive performance, and lameness was retained individually as a potential measure. Mean pregnancy rates, in both 2018 (PD18) and 2017 (PD17), were ~91% and mean weaning rate was 84%. Of the welfare measures, only lameness had a direct association with pregnancy rate, as well as a confounding effect on the association between mating period and pregnancy rate. The bull: cow ration (mean 1:31) and reproductive conditions (dystocia, abortion, vaginal prolapse) did not influence pregnancy and weaning rates. In the study population, there was no clear association between welfare and reproductive performance, except for the confounding effects of lameness.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the last 20 years, IBV has been continuously circulating among chicken flocks in Egypt causing huge economic losses to poultry production. Multiple IBV genotypes, namely, GI-1, GI-13, GI-16, and GI-23 have been reported in Egypt possessing different genetic and pathogenic features. Different vaccine programs are being used to control the spread of the disease in Egypt. However, the virus continues to spread and evolve where multiple IBV variants and several recombination evidence have been described. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge concerning IBV circulation, genesis, and vaccination strategies in Egypt. In addition, we analyze representative Egyptian IBV strains from an evolutionary perspective based on available data of their S1 gene. We also provide insight into the importance of surveillance programs and share our perspectives for better control of IBV circulating in Egypt.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While public awareness of the disease has increased, few studies have evaluated the incidence of acute cytauxzoonosis cases and their associated risk factors. The objective of this study was to retrospectively review records of cats diagnosed with acute cytauxzoonosis in eastern Kansas from 2006-2019 using clinic records and determine: (i) feline cytauxzoonosis risk factors; and (ii) if cytauxzoonosis case incidence is increasing. Although inter-annual variation of acute cytauxzoonosis diagnosis was observed in the eastern Kansas domestic cat population, the overall incidence trend remained largely unchanged over the 14-year case review period. In comparison to ill (C. felis-unrelated) control cases, more acute cytauxzoonosis cases were diagnosed in spring and summer, suggesting a seasonal fluctuation of infection, with samples most commonly submitted from &#8805;1 year old, owned, male cats. Although cytauxzoonosis case submissions remained consistent over the broad study period, increasing tick vector and domestic cat reservoir populations may contribute to additional cytauxzoonosis case expansion in endemic areas. Investigating the incidence of acute cytauxzoonosis, patient risk factors, and ecological variables that influence disease transmission are important steps towards developing and communicating the need for effective cytauxzoonosis control strategies for high-risk cat populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria compounded with a slow discovery rate for new antibiotics that have necessitated scientific efforts to search for alternatives to antibiotics. Research on the identification of AMPs has generated very encouraging evidence that they curb infectious pathologies and are also useful as novel biologics to function as immunotherapeutic agents. Being innate, they exhibit the least cytotoxicity to the host and exerts a wide spectrum of biological activity including low resistance among microbes and increased wound healing actions. Notably, in veterinary science, the constant practice of massive doses of antibiotics with inappropriate withdrawal programs led to a high risk of livestock-associated antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the world faces tremendous pressure for designing and devising strategies to mitigate the use of antibiotics in animals and keep it safe for posterity. In this review, we illustrate the diversity of farm animal-specific AMPs, and their biochemical foundations, mode of action, and prospective application in clinics. Subsequently, we present the data for their systematic classification under the major and minor groups, antipathogenic action, and allied bioactivities in the host. Finally, we address the limitations of their clinical implementation and envision areas for further advancement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Herein we describe a framework to evaluate dog and cat rabies incidence levels in exporting countries along with the associated uncertainty for such QRAs. For enzootic dog rabies areas (EDRAs), we extended and adapted a previously published method to specify the relationship between dog rabies vaccination coverage and canine rabies incidence; the relationship between dog and cat rabies incidences; and then to predict annual dog and cat rabies incidences. In non-enzootic dog rabies areas (nEDRAs), we provided annual incidence based on declared dog and cat rabies cases. For EDRAs, we predicted an annual incidence potentially greater than 1.5% in dogs and about ten times lower in cats with a high burden in Africa and Asia but much lower in Latin America. In nEDRAs, the occurrence of rabies was lower and of similar magnitude in dogs and cats. However, wildlife could still potentially infect dogs and cats through spillover events. This framework can directly be incorporated in QRAs of rabies reintroduction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33353135</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Risk Factors and Severity of Gastrointestinal Parasites in Selected Small Ruminants from Malaysia.</Title>	<Abstract>The productivity of smallholder sheep and goat flocks is constrained by high morbidity and mortality of young stock due to helminthosis and coccidiosis. We hypothesized that gastrointestinal parasites are prevalent and may cause severe infections amongst small ruminants in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between March and December 2019 to investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and levels of infection with gastrointestinal strongyle and coccidia in selected smallholder goat flocks in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. A total of 257 blood and fecal samples and management data were collected from four farms in Negeri Sembilan. Gastrointestinal parasites were detected by routine sodium chloride floatation, and the McMaster technique was used to quantify the fecal eggs/oocysts per gram outputs (EPG/OPG). The severity of infection was classified as mild (50-799), moderate (800-1200), or severe (&gt;1200). The packed cell volume (PCV) was determined by microhematocrit centrifugation and classified as anemic or non-anemic. Coprological examination revealed an overall prevalence of 78.6% (CI = 72.74-83.44) and 100% flock level prevalence of strongyle and coccidia infection among goats from Negeri Sembilan with a higher infection in flock A-Lenggeng (95.6%) than B-Senawang (87.3%), D-Mendom (80.6%), or C-Seremban (60.0%). The co-infections of strongyle + Eimeria (50.6; CI = 44.50 to 56.64) were more common than single infections of either strongyle (16.7%; CI = 12.66 to 21.78) or Eimeria (4.3%; CI = 2.41 to 7.50). Quantitative analysis has revealed different (p &lt; 0.05) patterns of EPG/OPG in various categories of goats. In total, there were 49.8% mild, 8.6% moderate, and 13.6% severe infections of strongyle and 40.1% mild, 6.6% moderate, and 19.8% severe infections of coccidia among goats. The mean PCV of goats with severe strongyle infection (24.60 &#177; 0.85) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than the moderate (26.90 &#177; 1.15), or mild (28.23 &#177; 0.50) infections and the uninfected (30.4 &#177; 0.71). There were increased odds of infection with strongyle and coccidia among female (OR = 3.2) and adult (OR = 11.0) goats from smallholder flocks in Negeri Sembilan. In conclusion, gastrointestinal strongyles and coccidia occur at high frequency among smallholder goats, and there is a higher risk of infection amongst the adult and female stock.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It occurs worldwide, causing significant economic losses through decreased productivity, low fertility, increased cull rates and mortality. It is listed by the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) as a disease of concern to trade in animals. Prevalence of this disease can be studied by detecting anti-MAP antibodies by Enzyme linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The aim of this study was to investigate the current prevalence of MAP infection in cattle in Khartoum State. The overall apparent prevalence of MAP infection was found to be 6.3% and 18.9% at animal and herd levels, respectively. All seropositive animals were cross-bred females of good body condition; most of them (&gt;90%) were &gt;3 years old and &gt;50% were from medium-sized herds in Omdurman. No significant association (p &gt; 0.05) was found between seropositivity and animal herd size. The prevalence of MAP infection in Khartoum State is still low to medium compared to other parts of the world, but it is comparable to those reported from other African countries. Further studies with the view of designing nationwide surveys in domestic ruminants and camels in other states of the country are needed for establishing control programmes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Low 5-HT concentrations have been linked to behavioural disorders in dogs. This study aimed at investigating possible differences in dogs' serum TRP and 5-HT concentrations according to their behavioural response to a potentially stressful procedure. Thirty-nine physically healthy shelter dogs, 15 females and 24 males, mean age = 5.6 years, were categorized by a certified veterinary behaviourist according to their behavioural response to medical examination and blood collection, in: relaxation, stress signals, tension without growling, tension with growling, escape attempts, and aggression attempts. Extraction and quantification of 5-HT and TRP were performed using a HLPC method. Data were statistically analysed, applying Chi-square and Spearman tests. Results showed no significant difference in TRP (&#967;[2] = 2.084, p = 0.555) nor 5-HT (&#967;[2] = 0.972, p = 0.808) serum concentrations among different categories of dogs; however, some categories were underrepresented (relaxation = 20.5%, stress signals = 30.8%, tension without growling = 43.6%, tension with growling = 5.1%, escape attempts = 0%, aggression attempts = 0%). No correlation between serum TRP and 5-HT concentrations was found (&#961; = 0.086, p = 0.602). Serum 5-HT levels do not seem to be associated with dogs' behavioural response to a stressful situation nor with serum TRP concentrations. The relationship between serum TRP and 5-HT concentrations and behaviour needs further research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One promising intervention approach is the breeding of Nosema-resistant honey bee colonies using molecular technologies, for example marker-assisted selection (MAS). For this, specific genetic markers used in bee selection should be developed. The objective of the paper is to search for associations between some microsatellite markers and Nosema disease in a dark forest bee Apis mellifera mellifera. For the dark forest bee, the most promising molecular genetic markers for determining resistance to nosemosis are microsatellite loci AC117, Ap243 and SV185, the alleles of which ("177", "263" and "269", respectively) were associated with a low level of Nosema infection. This article is the first associative study aimed at finding DNA loci of resistance to nosemosis in the dark forest bee. Nevertheless, microsatellite markers identified can be used to predict the risk of developing the Nosema disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several emerging fungal and bacterial diseases, however, are currently threatening honeybees without known mechanisms of pathogenicity. Therefore, the aim of the current work was to investigate the seasonal (winter, spring, summer, and autumn) fungal and bacterial distribution through different gut segments (crop, midgut, ileum, and rectum). This was done from two hives in Norway. Our main finding was that bacteria clustered by gut segments, while fungi were clustered by season. This knowledge can therefore be important in studying the epidemiology and potential mechanisms of emerging diseases in honeybees, and also serve as a baseline for understanding honeybee health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although these neoplasms are more frequently seen in dark-haired dogs, such as Giant Schnauzers, there are no data checking whether these tumors are histologically different between breeds. We histologically evaluated DSCC from 94 dogs. These were divided into two groups, namely, (1) dark-haired (N = 76) and (2) light-haired breeds (N = 18), further subdividing Group 1 into three subgroups, (1a) black breeds (n = 11), (1b) Schnauzers (n = 34) and (1c) black &amp; tan breeds (n = 31). Adaptations from two different squamous cell carcinomas grading schemes from human and veterinary literature were used. Both systems showed significant differences when compared to Groups 1 and 2 in terms of final grade, invasive front keratinization, degree of invasion, nuclear pleomorphism, tumor cell budding, smallest tumor nest size and amount of tumor stroma. Group 2 was consistently better differentiated CDSCC than Group 1. However, there were no significant differences among the dark-haired breeds in any of the features evaluated. This study represents the first attempt to grade CDSCC while taking into account both phenotypical and presumptive genotypical haircoat color. In conclusion, CDSCC are not only more common in dark-haired dogs, they are also histologically more aggressive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Biochemical analysis, ultrasonography, and retrograde urethrocystography revealed probable portosystemic shunt and incomplete urethral obstruction due to uric acid ammonium calculi. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed portosystemic shunt and proliferation of the osseous tissue of the os penis, which was surgically removed. Histopathologically, the excised osseous tissue comprised bland lamellar bone without atypia or inflammation. Hyperplasia of the os penis was diagnosed based on the image findings and histopathology. The dysuria improved postoperatively. This is the first report of dysuria associated with non-neoplastic bone hyperplasia of the os penis in a dog. Careful evaluation of the os penis by CT is needed for accurate diagnosis in case of repeated penile urethral obstruction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty males were divided into two groups, one with mineral supplementation and one control. Seasonal evaluation was conducted during four periods: beginning, middle, and end of the dry period and middle of the rainy period. Rib and liver biopsies were performed, and blood was collected at each period to evaluate mineral accumulation. Ca, P, Cu, Fe, Mo, Zn, and Co concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry after acid digestion. Normal Ca, P, and Mo; low Cu, Zn, and Co; and high Fe levels were observed in the diet. The young animals analyzed showed normal serum and bone Ca and P concentrations, suggesting no need for supplementation throughout the entire year under the conditions of this study. Iron showed high values throughout the year, being potentially dangerous especially owing to its antagonistic relationship with other elements. Cu and Zn deficiency in the diet was observed under the conditions of this study, requiring supplementation with values higher than those contained in the mineral supplement used in the middle and end of the dry period. The supply of specific mineral supplement formulated for animals farmed in the semiarid region is suggested and would reduce costs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the concomitant administration of anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics may exaggerate massive toxic effects on many organs. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Cin) is considered one of the most broadly utilized plants with various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of cinnamon aqueous extract (Cin) against DFS and OTC hepato-renal toxicity. Eight groups (8/group) of adult male albino rats were treated orally for 15 days with physiological saline (control), Cin aqueous extract (300 mg/kg b.w.), OTC (200 mg/kg b.w.), single dose of DFS at the 14th day (100 mg/kg b.w.), DFS + OTC, Cin + DFS, Cin + OTC, and Cin + DFS + OTC. The administration of DFS and/or OTC significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as hepatic and renal malondialdehyde and nitric oxide metabolites, were also raised following DFS and OTC administration. Meanwhile, the activities of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in liver and kidney were significantly suppressed in DFS, OTC, and DFS + OTC treated rats. Moreover, hepatic and renal tissue sections from these rats exhibited overexpression of caspase-3 and cyclooxygenase-II on immunohistochemical investigation. The administration of Cin aqueous extract ameliorated the aforementioned deteriorations caused by DFS, OTC, and their combination. Conclusively, Cin is a promising protective plant extract capable of attenuating the oxidative damage, apoptosis, and inflammation induced by DFS and OTC either alone or combined, on hepatic and renal tissues.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>33467596</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Screening of Cyanide-Utilizing Bacteria from Rumen and In Vitro Evaluation of Fresh Cassava Root Utilization with Pellet Containing High Sulfur Diet.</Title>	<Abstract>Two experiments were undertaken to screen for ruminal cyanide-utilizing bacteria (Experiment 1), and to evaluate the influence of fresh cassava root (FCR) and pellets containing high sulfur (PELFUR) on cyanide content, gas production parameters, in vitro degradability, and ruminal fermentation (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 was conducted in a completely randomized design (CRD) for the screening of cyanide-utilizing bacteria and the dietary treatments consisted of cyanide at 0, 150, 300, and 450 ppm. In Experiment 2, a 5 &#215; 3 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design was used for the in vitro study. Factor A was the level of FCR at 0, 260, 350, 440, and 530 g/kg of dry matter (DM) substrate, and factor B was the level of PELFUR at 0, 15, and 30 g/kg DM substrate. In Experiment 1, adding different doses of cyanide significantly affected cyanide-utilizing rumen bacterial growth (p &lt; 0.05). Increasing the concentration of cyanide from 0 to 150 and 150 to 300 ppm resulted in increases in cyanide-utilizing rumen bacteria of 38.2% and 15.0%, respectively. In Experiment 2, no interaction effects were found between FCR and PELFUR doses on gas production parameters (p &gt; 0.05). Increasing the FCR level to more than 260 g/kg of DM substrate could increase cumulative gas production (p &lt; 0.05). Increasing doses of PELFUR from 15 to 30 g/kg increased the cumulative gas production when compared with that of 0 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate (p &lt; 0.05). The cyanide concentration in rumen fluid decreased with PELFUR (p &lt; 0.05) supplementation. Degradability of in vitro DM and organic matter following incubation increased at 12 and 24 h due to PELFUR supplementation with FCR and increased additionally with 15 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate (p &lt; 0.05) in 440 g FCR/kg of DM substrate. Proportions of the total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), and butyric acid among supplementations with FCR (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly different. In conclusion, the present results represent the first finding of bacteria in the rumen that are capable of utilizing cyanide, and suggests that cyanide might function as a nitrogen source for bacterial cell synthesis. The inclusion of FCR of 530 g/kg with 30 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate could increase the cumulative gas production, the bacterial population, the in vitro degradability, the proportion of C3, and the rate of the disappearance of cyanide.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) within such infections is a growing concern. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the involvement of S. pseudintermedius in canine disease pathology to gain better insight into novel treatment avenues. Here, we review the literature focused on S. pseudintermedius infection in multiple anatomic locations in dogs and the role of MRSP in treatment outcomes at these niches. Multiple novel treatment avenues for MRSP have been pioneered in recent years and these are discussed with a specific focus on vaccines and phage therapy as potential therapeutic options. Whilst both undertakings are in their infancy, phage therapy is versatile and has shown high success in both animal and human medical use. It is clear that further research is required to combat the growing problems associated with MRSP in canines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They infect predominantly ruminants and induce severe congenital malformation. In adult animals, the intra vitam diagnostics by direct virus detection is limited to only a few days due to a short-lived viremia. For surveillance purposes the testing for specific antibodies is a superior approach. However, the serological differentiation is hampered by a considerable extent of cross-reactivity, as viruses were assigned into this serogroup based on antigenic relatedness. Here, we established a glycoprotein Gc-based triplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and differentiation of antibodies against SBV, AKAV, and SHUV. A total of 477 negative samples of various ruminant species, 238 samples positive for SBV-antibodies, 36 positive for AKAV-antibodies and 53 SHUV antibody-positive samples were tested in comparison to neutralization tests. For the newly developed ELISA, overall diagnostic specificities of 84.56%, 94.68% and 89.39% and sensitivities of 89.08%, 69.44% and 84.91% were calculated for SBV, AKAV and SHUV, respectively, with only slight effects of serological cross-reactivity on the diagnostic specificity. Thus, this test system could be used for serological screening in suspected populations or as additional tool during outbreak investigations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This review attempts to present information on Trichuris spp. infestation in neo-tropical rodents that are utilized for meat consumption by humans. Neo-tropical rodents utilized for meat production can be divided into two categories: those that have been domesticated, which include the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and those that are on the verge of domestication, such as the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), lappe (Cuniculus paca/Agouti paca), and agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). This document reviews the literature on the species of Trichuris that affects the rodents mentioned above, as well as the clinical signs observed. The literature obtained spans over sixty years, from 1951 to 2020. Trichuris spp. was found in these neo-tropical rodents mentioned. However, there is a dearth of information on the species of Trichuris that parasitize these animals. The capybara was the only rodent where some molecular techniques were used to identify a new species named T. cutillasae. In most cases, Trichuris spp. was found in combination with other endoparasites, and was found at a low prevalence in the lappe and guinea pig. The presence of Trichuris spp. ranged from 4.62-53.85% in the agouti, 4.21-10.00% in the lappe, 50% in the capybaras, and 1-31% in guinea pigs. Further work must be done towards molecular identification of various Trichuris spp. present in these rodents, as well as the clinical effect of infection on the performance of agouti, lappe, capybara, and guinea pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The definitive hosts of T. gondii are felid vertebrates including the domestic cat. Domestic cats shed oocysts for approximately two weeks in their feces after the primary infection. It has been shown that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) positive cats have a higher prevalence of and a higher titer of antibodies to T. gondii than those of FIV-negative cats. The main purposes of this study were to determine FIV prevalence and to investigate the oocysts shedding in FIV-positive and FIV-negative feral cats on St. Kitts. Fecal samples were collected from feral cats while their FIV statues were determined using a commercial SNAP kit. Total fecal DNA of each cat was tested for the presence of T. gondii DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) consistently detecting one genome equivalent. A FIV-positive status was detected in 18 of 105 (17.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.9%-24.3%) feral cats sampled. Furthermore, males were three times more likely to be FIV positive than females (p = 0.017) with an odds ratio of 3.93 (95% CI: 1.20-12.89). Adults were found to have at least twice the prevalence of FIV compared to cats younger than one year of age (p = 0.056) with an odds ratio of 3.07 (95% CI: 0.94-10.00). Toxoplasma gondii DNA was not detected in the feces of any of the 18 FIV-positive (95% CI: 0%-0.18%) and 87 FIV-negative cats (95% CI: 0%-0.04%). A follow-up study with a much bigger sample size is needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis that FIV-positive cats have a higher prevalence of shedding T. gondii oocysts than FIV-negative cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study surveyed student perspectives and academic performance in a pre-planned online second-year veterinary toxicology course given at North Carolina State University in Spring 2020. This course relied on asynchronous narrated presentations for content delivery. This method of delivery predated the pandemic and was used throughout the course. Academic performance and patterns of access to materials in the online course was compared with the access patterns and performance of students given classroom-based synchronous teaching in Spring 2019. Assessments evaluated in this study were identical across courses. Students' academic performance was unaffected by delivery method. Lack of instructor interaction was an important perceived barrier in the asynchronous course. Asynchronous course materials were uniformly accessed across all days of the week, while supplemental materials for the face-to-face course showed a weekly pattern. Moving from letter grades to pass/fail did not change access frequency to supplemental course materials but led to decreased video usage in the asynchronous course. Results suggest that although some veterinary students perceived the switch in delivery format negatively, the method of delivery did not adversely affect performance in this preclinical course.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, we invited veterinary clinics in the state of Queensland, Australia, to provide detailed data on snake envenomation cases in dogs. A total of 230 cases were reported from 19 veterinary hospitals, with an average of 12.1 dogs per clinic, per year. Detailed case data were provided from 20 dogs-of these, 65.0% (13/20) were envenomated during the daytime, with collapse and paresis being the most common signs reported by owners. The median time between the onset of clinical signs and admission to the veterinary hospital was 60 min. Clinical signs were the sole diagnostic modality utilised by veterinarians in 30.0% (6/20) of cases. Activated clotting time was the most common diagnostic procedure conducted, while snake venom detection kits (SVDK) were only used in 15.0% (3/20) of cases. Of the dogs that received antivenom (85.0%, 17/20), the tiger/multibrown combination (3000 units tiger/4000 units brown) was predominately (13/17) provided. Three of the 17 dogs that received antivenom (17.6%) died or were euthanised. About 82.4% (14/17) of the dogs treated with antivenom, but only 33.3% (1/3) of the dogs not treated with antivenom, recovered (p = 0.140). Overall, veterinarians relied frequently on medical history, clinical signs, and diagnostic tests other than the SVDK and, thus, most likely, administered snake envenomation treatment based on their clinical experience.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They also make up a large proportion of emerging infectious diseases. (2) Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed publications was performed and based on the guidelines set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. (3) Results: The final set of publications consisted of 145 publications. Thirty-two viruses were identified in the publications and 50 African ungulates were reported/diagnosed with viral infections. Eighteen countries had viruses diagnosed in wild ungulates reported in the literature. (4) Conclusions: A comprehensive review identified several areas where little information was available and recommendations were made. It is recommended that governments and research institutions offer more funding to investigate and report viral diseases of greater clinical and zoonotic significance. A further recommendation is for appropriate One Health approaches to be adopted for investigating, controlling, managing and preventing diseases. Diseases which may threaten the conservation of certain wildlife species also require focused attention. In order to keep track of these diseases, it may be necessary to consider adding a "Wildlife disease and infection" category to the World Organisation for Animal Health-listed diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The fat tissue was enzymatically digested and the number of nucleated cells in the SVF was counted. The SVF was cultured in vitro and the cell growth was assessed by counting the CFU per gram of fat and the aspect ratio of the cells.</Abstract><Abstract>There was no significant difference in the number of nucleated cells in the SVF from the two sites. The CFU/g of fat from falciform was 378.9 &#177; 293 g and from flank was 486.8 &#177; 517 g, and this was also insignificant. Neither age nor weight of the patient had an impact on the SVF or CFU/g. No surgical complications were reported from either of the sites. Harvesting fat for stem cell therapy for intra-articular therapy of degenerative joint disease can be an easy and fast process when obtaining the fat either from the flank or the falciform region, and it is not age or weight dependent. The harvest site for clinical canine patients can be left to the surgeon's discretion and comfort.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cats with previously suspected or diagnosed thyroid disease were excluded. Serum tT4 was evaluated in surplus serum samples at the time of admission for CCs and CGs. The APPLEfast score of the CC group was calculated at admission. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in CCs was determined using proposed criteria. Cats were divided into survivors and non-survivors according to the discharge outcome. Forty-nine cats were retrospectively included. Twenty-seven cats died during hospitalization. The CG group was composed of 37 cats. The CC group showed a significantly lower tT4 compared to the CG group (1.3 &#177; 0.7 vs. 2 &#177; 0.9; p &lt; 0.0001). Among SIRS, APPLEfast, and tT4, only tT4 was associated with mortality (p = 0.04). The tT4 cut-off point for mortality was 1.65 &#956;g/dL (sensitivity 81%, specificity 57%, odds ratio (OR) 5.6). Twenty-five cats (51%) had SIRS that was not associated with tT4. Non-thyroidal illness syndrome can occur in critically ill cats and the evaluation of tT4 in hospitalized cats could add prognostic information.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This review aimed to identify specific constraints to small ruminant production and identify practical and sustainable solutions. From 54 eligible articles, most were focused in Ethiopia (n = 44) with only 6 studies performed in Tanzania and 4 in Uganda. The most frequently identified constraint in Ethiopia and Tanzania was disease (n = 28 and n = 3, respectively), and in Uganda, it was the lack of access to veterinary services (n = 4). Additionally, access to good breeding stock, lack of animal records, and an established marketing chain were also mentioned in all the three countries. Ectoparasites, gastrointestinal parasites, orf, and sheep/goat pox were the most frequently mentioned disease challenges causing productivity losses. Many articles provided potential solutions as suggested by farmers, including improved access to veterinary services and medicines, improved record keeping, and access to good breeding stock. Farmers highlighted the value of community-based participatory development plans to increase education on disease control, land management, and husbandry. This review also highlighted knowledge gaps, the need for further research, particularly in Tanzania and Uganda, and the importance of addressing multiple challenges holistically due to the links between constraints.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there have been no reports confirming the presence of mesenchymal stem cells in Wharton's jelly in cats. The purpose of this study was to isolate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the Wharton's jelly of cats and to characterize stem cells. In this study, feline Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (fWJ-MSCs) were isolated and successfully cultured. fWJ-MSCs were maintained and the proliferative potential was measured by cumulative population doubling level (CPDL) test, scratch test, and colony forming unit (CFU) test. Stem cell marker, karyotyping and immunophenotyping analysis by flow cytometry showed that fWJ-MSCs possessed characteristic mesenchymal stem cell markers. To confirm the differentiation potential, we performed osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic induction under each differentiation condition. fWJ-MSCs has the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages, including osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. This study shows that Wharton's jelly of cat can be a good source of mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, fWJ-MSCs may be useful for stem cell-based therapeutic applications in feline medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study population was divided in two groups according to the presence (PH) or absence (nPH) of pulmonary haemorrhage. A statistical comparison was performed at hospital admission for clinical (spontaneous bleeding, icterus, and respiratory distress), laboratory (serum creatinine, urea, phosphate, calcium, bicarbonate, bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALKP, GGT, total protein, albumin, glycaemia, sodium, potassium, CRP, RBC, HCT, HGB, WBC, PLT, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen), and pulmonary radiographic findings between the two groups of dogs. At hospital admission, dogs developing pulmonary haemorrhage were more likely to have respiratory distress (p = 0.002), severely elevated serum bilirubin (p = 0.002), AST (p = 0.04), ALT (p = 0.012), ALKP (p = 0.002), reduced serum glycaemia (p = 0.014), and thrombocytopenia (p = 0.04). Respiratory distress and elevated serum bilirubin (&#8805;11.5 mg/dL) were independently associated with increased risk of pulmonary haemorrhage. In conclusion, the presence of respiratory distress at hospital admission is strongly associated (OR 40.9) with increased risk of pulmonary haemorrhage, even though no abnormalities are found at chest radiography.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This technique is used in human and small animal medicine to diagnose cardiac diseases. Using this technique, we evaluated the longitudinal myocardial peak velocities of the interventricular septum, and the left and right ventricular free walls in the systole and diastole in 40 racing pigeons. The TDI examinations confirmed the movement of the heart base toward the apex in the systole and away from the apex in the diastole. Inhomogeneous distribution of the myocardial velocities with a statistically significant velocity gradient from the basal to the apical myocardial segments was found. The left and right free walls have significantly higher myocardial velocities than the myocardium of the septum. The myocardial velocities during active ventricular filling were significantly higher in the right ventricular free wall than in the left one. The validation of the method resulted in coefficients of variation between 3% and 33% for the systolic and 3% and 75% for the diastolic individual myocardial velocities. Weekly repeated measurements resulted in variation coefficients between 3% and 45% for systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, we investigated the effect of physical rehabilitation in cats suffering from naturally occurring TL spinal cord injury. The medical records of 36 cats with acute onset of TL spinal cord injury that were selected for rehabilitation treatment were reviewed. Twenty-nine cats underwent an intensive physical rehabilitation protocol in the clinic (group 1), whereas the owners of seven cats declined physical rehabilitation (group 2). In group 1, seven cats had pelvic limb deep pain perception (DPP), which was significantly associated with the functional recovery of voluntary ambulatory status (p = 0.010) and voluntary micturition (p &lt; 0.001). Spinal walking was achieved in 10/22 (45%) of the cats without DPP, and none regained voluntary micturition. In group 2, no cats regained ambulatory status or voluntary micturition, although pelvic limb DPP was present in three patients. Treatment with a clinic-based rehabilitation program and the presence of a crossed extensor reflex were significantly associated with a higher possibility of regaining functional ambulatory status (p &lt; 0.010), but there was no difference in the recovery of voluntary micturition between the groups. Thus, cats with severe, naturally occurring, acute onset of TL spinal cord injury may benefit from physical rehabilitation. In the case of the loss of DPP, the acquisition of spinal walking is possible, despite the high possibility of a persistent neurologically dysfunctional bladder.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, attached and unattached Ixodid ticks were removed from companion animals by a veterinary practice in Hall County, Georgia. DNA was extracted from unengorged adult ticks and each was screened for the presence of Rickettsia spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced to determine the species present. Two hundred and four adult hard-bodied ticks were identified to species and Rickettsia spp. were found in 19.6% (n = 38) of the 194 analyzed DNA extracts. Rickettsia montanensis was found in Dermacentor variablis (14.7%; n = 25), Amblyomma maculatum (33.3%; n = 2), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. ticks (25%; n = 4). One Amblyomma americanum tick contained Rickettsia amblyommatis, while Rickettsia felis was found in one Dermacentor variablis tick, serving as the first report of Rickettsia felis in a tick in this region and within this tick vector. This study suggests that there is a risk of companion animals contracting a species of Rickettsia from a tick bite in northeastern Georgia, indicating a need for more investigation and highlighting the importance of tick prevention on pets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33668208</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Diversity of Hard Tick Species from Selected Areas of a Wildlife-Livestock Interface Ecosystem at Mikumi National Park, Morogoro Region, Tanzania.</Title>	<Abstract>Ticks are one of the most important arthropod vectors and reservoirs as they harbor a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes, which can cause diseases in human and livestock. Due to their impact on human, livestock, and wild animal health, increased knowledge of ticks is needed. So far, the published data on the molecular diversity between hard ticks species collected in Tanzania is scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity between hard tick species collected in the wildlife-livestock interface ecosystem at Mikumi National Park, Tanzania using the mitochondrion 16S rRNA gene sequences. Adult ticks were collected from cattle (632 ticks), goats (187 ticks), and environment (28 ticks) in the wards which lie at the border of Mikumi National Park. Morphological identification of ticks was performed to genus level. To identify ticks to species level, molecular analysis based on mitochondrion 16S rRNA gene was performed. Ticks representing the two genera (Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus) were identified using morphological characters. Six species were confirmed based on mitochondrion 16S rRNA gene, including Rhipicephalus microplus, Rhipicephalus evertsi, Hyalomma rufipes, Hyalomma truncatum, Hyalomma marginatum, and Hhyalomma turanicum. The presence of different clusters of tick species reflects the possible biological diversity of the hard ticks present in the study region. Further studies are however required to quantify species of hard ticks present in the study region and the country in general over a larger scale.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Various treatment regimens were attempted in the past but were found to be partially effective. Here, we claim a successful treatment regime using an FDA-approved macrocyclic lactone, a piperazine derivative, and an herbal preparation. Twenty-four cattle (18 affected and 6 unaffected) were selected and divided into Gr 1: positive control (infected without treatment; n = 6), Gr 2: treatment group (infected with treatment with ivermectin; n = 6), Gr 3: treatment group (infected with treatment with tri-model therapy including ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine citrate, and an herbal ointment, n = 6), and Gr 4: negative control (non-infected animals; n = 6). In Gr 2 and Gr 3, treatment to the ailing animals were given for 30 days. Lesion was significantly reduced in day 15 of post-treatment and completely healed on day 30 of post-treatment in Gr 3. Tri-model therapy recorded significant improvement in the surface area of the sore as compared to ivermectin administration alone. Antioxidants were increased and malondialdehyde (MDA) and cortisol concentrations were decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in Gr 3 than in untreated control group at day 14, 21 and 28. Histopathological changes in infected animals were characterized by parakeratotic hyperkeratosis along with presence of nucleated keratinocytes. There were infiltrations of polymorphonuclear cells specially eosinophils along with a few monomorphonuclear cells. Microfilarial organism was observed beneath the epidermis, which was surrounded by fibrocytes and infiltrated cells. In the tri-model-treated animal after recovery, the skin revived a normal architecture. Therefore, tri-model therapy has the potential to cure humpsore.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The sedation reduces tear production, often leading to perioperative exposure keratopathy. The aim of the present study was to report the effects of intramuscular dexmedetomidine on canine tear production, measured by STT-1, for an experimental period of 8 h after sedation. Ten dogs who underwent sedation for routine radiologic assessment were recruited for the study. In all animals, tear production in right and left eyes was measured 15 min before sedation (T0: basal values) and 20 min (T20), 1 h (T1), 2 h (T2), 4 h (T4) and 8 h (T8) after drug administration. Analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test (p &lt; 0.05) were performed. A significant effect of time on canine tear production was found. The tear production returned to basal values at T8. So, it is recommended to treat the canine eyes with tear substitutes during and up to 12 h after sedation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The accuracy of pulse pressure variation (PPV), systolic pressure variation (SPV), stroke volume variation (SVV), and plethysmographic variability index (PVI) for predicting FR was also evaluated. Dogs were anaesthetised with methadone, propofol, and inhaled isoflurane in oxygen, under volume-controlled mechanical ventilation. FC was performed by the administration of 5 mL/kg of Ringer's lactate within 5 min. Cardiac index (CI; L/min/m[2]), PPV, (%), SVV (%), SPV (%), and PVI (%) were registered before and after FC. Data were analysed with ANOVA and ROC tests (p &lt; 0.05). Fluid responsiveness was defined as 15% increase in CI. Eighty dogs completed the study. Fifty (62.5%) were responders and 30 (37.5%) were nonresponders. The PPV, PVI, SPV, and SVV cut-off values (AUC, p) for discriminating responders from nonresponders were PPV &gt;13.8% (0.979, &lt;0.001), PVI &gt;14% (0.956, &lt;0.001), SPV &gt;4.1% (0.793, &lt;0.001), and SVV &gt;14.7% (0.729, &lt;0.001), respectively. Up to 62.5% of normotensive dogs under inhalant anaesthesia may be fluid responders. PPV and PVI have better diagnostic accuracy to predict FR, compared to SPV and SVV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty healthy crossbreed pigs with similar age, weight, and body condition score were distributed into five treatment groups. The pigs were intramuscularly injected once with different doses of ketoprofen: 3 mg/kg (group 1X), 6 mg/kg (group 2X), 9 mg/kg (group 3X). In addition, the 3 mg/kg dosis was administered on three consecutive days (group 1X ext.). Intramuscular injections of saline solution were used in control group (CTL). The pigs were clinically examined throughout the trial and blood samples were taken for hematological and biochemical evaluation on days -4 (before treatment), +3, +7, and +14 (the end of the trial). Any unusual behaviour or clinical signs were reported as potential toxic effects of ketoprofen. Serum measurements showed that none of the ketoprofen doses produced changes in renal or hepatic biochemical parameters, liver enzymes, or total bilirubin. Likewise, hematological assessment indicated no altered parameters or hematocrit percentage in the study groups. These results demonstrate that ketoprofen has no adverse effects in pigs when the doses and scheme evaluated in this study are applied.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there are some reports that it may cause several health problems. The aim of this study is to evaluate embryotoxic effects of SY on liver and kidney in chick embryos. Babcock white Leghorn eggs were randomly divided into four groups. Non-treated eggs served as control group. The eggs in groups SY200, SY1000, and SY2000 were treated with a single injection of 200, 1000, and 2000 ng SY into the air sac just before incubation. The developmental stages of embryos were determined on the 10th, 13th, 16th, and 21st days of incubation. Samples of the liver and kidney were taken and routine histological procedures were performed. The highest relative embryo weight was seen in all SY treated groups on the 16th day of incubation. Necrosis of some hepatocytes and cytoplasmic degenerations were observed in all SY groups in the liver. There were degenerated or destructed renal cortex structures and necrosis in the kidney. The cell's nuclear areas and diameters of renal cortex structures were different in all SY groups compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that in ovo administered SY has many unfavorable effects on liver and kidney in chick embryos. The results obtained in this study suggest that it may be advisable to re-assess safety levels of SY in many industries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Microfilariae species were identified using High Resolution Melting real-time PCR (HRM real-time PCR). The prevalence of canine microfilaremia was 16.2% (45/278) in Chanthaburi and 5.5% (12/217) in Samut Sakhon. The prevalence of canine microfilaremia in Narathiwat was 22.7% (67/273). Brugia pahangi and Dirofilaria immitis were the predominant species of filariae found in the infected dogs from Chanthaburi and Narathiwat, respectively. The low prevalence of canine microfilaremia of Samut Sakhon may reflect the success of the Soi Dog foundation's efforts and the establishment of veterinary control programs. An effective disease control and prevention strategies is needed in Chanthaburi and Narathiwat to reduce the risks of zoonotic transmission of the parasites. An appropriate drug treatment should be given to infected dogs and prophylactic drugs are suggested to be given to dogs age &#8804;1-year-old to prevent filarial infection. The novel microfluidic device could be implemented for surveillance of filariae infection in other animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, corrective osteotomy for angular deformities requires substantial surgical experience for planning and performing accurate osteotomy. Three-dimensional printed patient-specific guides (3D-PSGs) were developed to overcome perioperative difficulties. In addition, novices can easily use these guides for performing accurate corrective osteotomy. We compared the postoperative results of corrective osteotomy accuracy when using 3D-PSGs in dogs between novice and experienced surgeons. We included eight dogs who underwent corrective osteotomy: three angular deformities of the radius and ulna, three distal femoral osteotomies, one center of rotational angle-based leveling osteotomy, and one corrective osteotomy with stifle arthrodesis. All processes, including 3D bone modeling, production of PSGs, and rehearsal surgery were carried out with computer-aided design software and a 3D-printed bone model. Pre- and postoperative positions following 3D reconstruction were evaluated by radiographs using the 2D/3D registration technique. All patients showed clinical improvement with satisfactory alignment and position. Postoperative accuracy evaluation revealed no significant difference between novice and experienced surgeons. PSGs are thought to be useful for novice surgeons to accurately perform corrective osteotomy in dogs without complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

RA was isolated and identified in broiler chickens, from a clinical case in a commercial broiler farm located in the southwest mainland of Greece. The morbidity and the mortality in the broiler house were estimated at 10% and 5% respectively. The observed clinical signs appeared at the age of 30 to 42 days with respiratory distress (dyspnea), white fluid feces and stunting. Post-mortem examinations displayed serositis, pericarditis, perihepatitis and airsacculitis. Edematous swelling around the tibio-tarsal joints was observed in some birds. Tissue samples from lesions were streaked on selective media. Three bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Moreover, an antibiogram analysis was performed for the three RA strains, using a pattern of 16 common antibiotics to advocate the most effective drugs for a proper treatment. All the RA isolates were sensitive to ceftiofur, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim and amoxicillin, whereas all were resistant to gentamicin, tylosin, tetracyclin, colistin sulphate, spectinomycin, lincomycin and oxytetracycline.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study was divided into two arms. In study arm 1: n = 50 swine intestinal loops (10 per group) were transected with each instrument and the loops in which the devices provided complete sealing, at the gross inspection, were tested for maximum burst pressure (BP) and histological evaluation and compared to an automatic linear stapler. After the BP tests, the devices that achieved significantly lower BP values were excluded from the second arm. The RFVS-1 and -3 provided statistically significant results and were used in study arm 2, to obtain full-thickness biopsies along the antimesenteric border of the loop and were compared with hand-sewn intestinal closure (n = 30; 10 per group). The biopsies were histologically evaluated for thermal injury and diagnostic features, and intestinal loops tested for BP. RFVS-3 achieved comparable results (69.78 &#177; 4.23 mmHg, interquartile range (IQR) 5.8) to stapler closing technique (71.09 &#177; 4.22 mmHg, IQR 4.38; p &gt; 0.05), while the RFVS-1 resulted in significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower BP (45.28 &#177; 15.23 mmHg, IQR 24.95) but over the physiological range, conversely to RFVS-2 (20.16 &#177; 7.19 mmHg, IQR 12.02) and HS (not measurable). RFVS-3 resulted not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) (45.09 &#177; 8.75 mmHg, IQR 10.48) than Suture (35.71 &#177; 17.51 mmHg, IQR 23.77); RFVS-1 resulted significantly lower values (23.96 &#177; 10.63 mmHg, IQR 9.62; p &lt; 0.05). All biopsies were judged diagnostic. Data confirmed that RFVS-1 and -3 devices provided suitable intestinal sealing, with BP pressures over the physiological range. Conversely, the HS and RFVS-2 should not be considered for intestinal sealing. RFVS devices could be employed to obtain small intestine stump closure or full-thickness biopsies. However, further studies should be performed in live animals to assess the role of the healing process.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four cattle with 100 &#177; 5.0 kg body weight were used in this study. A 2 &#215; 2 factorial experiment in a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design was conducted, in which factor A was the CP levels in concentrate of 14% and 16% of dry matter (DM) and factor B was the supplement levels of SG at 0.4% and 0.6% DM intake, respectively. The results showed that the CP content in concentrate and SG supplementation had no interaction effect on intake, digestibility, ruminal ecologies, ruminal fermentation products, and nitrogen utilization. Increasing CP content to 16% significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrogen (N) intake, N absorption, and N retention. SG supplementation significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased CP digestibility, NH3-N, blood urea nitrogen, and protozoa. In addition, SG significantly decreased acetate (C2), acetate to propionate ratio, methane, and fecal N excretion, while it significantly increased total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and propionate (C3) concentration. In conclusion, SG could mitigate methane emission and enhance nitrogen utilization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among cat owners with either healthy weight cats (body condition scores of 4-5/9) or obese cats (body condition scores of 8-9/9) as determined by a veterinarian. Exclusion criteria included medical conditions (determined by physical exam and screening bloodwork). Cat owners completed surveys on quality of life and perceptions of feline obesity. Quality of life scores for obese cats had a wider range and were numerically lower compared to scores of healthy weight cats with a moderate effect size of 0.68, though this was not a statistically significant difference (71.2 &#177; 8.8 vs. 75.9 &#177; 4.1, p = 0.0881; n = 33). Owners of obese cats less frequently reported that obesity was a high risk to their cat's health (77% [10/13]) vs. 100% [20/20]) and less frequently cited the primary caretaker as a cause of cat obesity (30% [3/10] vs. 55% [11/20]) compared to the owners of healthy weight cats. Interestingly, 97% (32/33) of all owners believed veterinarians should play a role in feline weight loss. These results suggest that some obese cats can have a potentially diminished quality of life but highlights the need for more data surrounding the impact of feline obesity and enhanced client communication strategies to best address obesity in the feline population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among other parasitic diseases, leishmaniasis remains an important public health problem caused by the protozoa of the genus Leishmania, transmitted by the bite of the female sand fly. The disease has also been linked to tropical and subtropical regions, in addition to being an endemic disease in many areas around the world, including the Mediterranean basin and South America. Although recent years have witnessed marked advances in Leishmania-related research in various directions, many issues have yet to be elucidated. The intention of the present review is to give an overview of the major virulence factors contributing to the pathogenicity of the parasite. We aimed to provide a concise picture of the factors influencing the reaction of the parasite in its host that might help to develop novel chemotherapeutic and vaccine strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to improve early and differential diagnostic capabilities and hence, prognosis for dogs with HSA, two types of biomarker are needed: a point-of-care diagnostic biomarker and a prognostic biomarker-preferentially based on samples obtained with minimally invasive methods. In this study, we applied a lectin magnetic bead array-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LeMBA-MS/MS) workflow through discovery and validation phases to discover serum glycoprotein biomarker candidates for canine HSA. By this approach, we found that Datura stramonium (DSA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Sambucus nigra (SNA), and Pisum sativum (PSA) lectins captured the highest number of validated candidate glycoproteins. Secondly, we independently validated serum LeMBA-MS/MS results by demonstrating the in situ relationship of lectin-binding with tumor cells. Using lectin-histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for key proteins on tissues with HSA and semi-quantitation of the signals, we demonstrate that a combination of DSA histochemistry and IHC for complement C7 greatly increases the prospect of a more specific diagnosis of canine HSA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A six-year-old female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a history of lethargy and appetite loss. The dog was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis based on hyperglycemia and renal glucose and ketone body loss. The dog's condition improved on intensive treatment of diabetes mellitus; daily subcutaneous insulin detemir injection maintained an appropriate blood glucose level over half a year. However, the dog's body weight gradually decreased from day 207, and on day 501, it presented with a decreased appetite; the precise cause could not be determined. Based on mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, hypoadrenocorticism was suggested; the diagnosis was made using an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. Daily fludrocortisone with low-dose prednisolone oral administration resulted in poor recovery of the blood chemistry abnormalities; however, monthly desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) subcutaneous injection with daily low-dose prednisolone oral administration helped in the significant recovery of the abnormalities. Therefore, clinicians should consider the possibility of coexistence of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs with diabetes mellitus presenting with undifferentiated weight loss. Additionally, DOCP (not fludrocortisone) may be useful in treating dogs with diabetes mellitus complicated with hypoadrenocorticism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the study was to describe the size of normal abdominal lymph nodes (ALs) in dogs affected by disease, not including lymphadenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, and divided according to body weight and age. The ALs studied included the jejunal, medial iliac, portal, gastric, splenic, and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes. Statistical correlation considering body weight and age as continuous variables showed that all measurements of the ALs increased according to body weight changes (p &lt; 0.01). The most reliable values were the volume measurements (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the length, thickness, and width. Mixed results emerged from a comparison of weight categories and age; only the jejunal lymph nodes showed a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05). Other characteristics (shape, attenuation, and enhancement) are subsequently reported. The resulting data can be used to categorize CT measurements of normal ALs displayed based on the body weight and age of the subjects. This study aimed to propose a new parameter of normalcy that may serve as a reference for the evaluation of infectious or neoplastic events.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present study was the comparison between three commercially available ELISA kits and a newly developed HPLC-FL method for the determination of the AFM1 in milk samples. The developed HPLC-FL method was validated for the AFM1 and Aflatoxin M2 (AFM2), determining the accuracy, precision, linearity, decision limit, and detection capability with fairly good results. All three ELISA kits were also validated and showed equally good performance with high recovery rates. Moreover, the Limit Of Detection (LOD) and Limit Of Quantification (LOQ) values were found to be significantly lower than the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) (50 ng kg[-1]). After the evaluation of all three commercial kits, the ELISA kit with the optimum performance along with the HPLC method was used for the determination of AFM1 in raw cow's, goat's, and sheep's milk samples (396) obtained from producers in different regions of Greece. The evaluation of both methods showed that this ELISA kit could be considered as a faster and equally reliable alternative method to HPLC in routine analysis for the determination of AFM1 in milk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Traditional laboratory tests, such as cell blood count, serum biochemistry, and coagulation, can be useful in investigating patients, but are not specific. However, markers like Troponin and Natriuretic Peptides may possibly furnish further data on myocardium damage and can be used in both studying and monitoring cats with cardiac disease. Moreover, the evaluation of the thyroid profile is very important as hyperthyroid cats concomitant cardiovascular diseases are very common and they can also be a direct consequence of endocrinopathy. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide the widest possible overview of what is present in the literature about the feline clinical pathology of heart diseases through a rational division of the main alterations of traditional tests and biomarkers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, results on the phenotype of hearing loss in DBA/2 mice have been mainly reported at an early stage in mice aged &#8804;7 weeks. Instead, the present study evaluated the hearing ability at 5, 13, and 34 weeks of age using DBA/2korl mice. Auditory brainstem response test was performed at 8-32 KHz at 5, 13, and 34 weeks of age, and hearing loss was confirmed to be induced in a time-dependent manner. In addition, histopathological evaluation at the same age confirmed the morphological damage of the cochlea. The findings presented herein are the results of the long-term observation of the phenotype of hearing loss in DBA/2 mice and can be useful in studies related to aging-dependent hearing loss.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In humans, alteration of sperm DNA methylation have been related to poor quality semen, impaired seminal parameters, azoospermia and reduced fertility. Although semen analysis is routinely used to evaluate the male reproductive potential in the canine species, no authors have attempted to relate semen characteristics to the sperm global DNA methylation (SGDM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the SGDM level in healthy dogs and to correlate it with semen parameters that are currently used in dog semen analyses. Conventional and unconventional (sperm DNA fragmentation and SGDM) seminal parameters of thirty dogs from different breeds were evaluated. A positive correlation was found between SGDM and sperm concentration (r = 0.41; p &lt; 0.05), and total sperm count (r = 0.61; p &lt; 0.001); SGDM was significantly lower in oligozoospermic vs non-oligozoospermic dogs (4.3% vs. 8.7%; p &lt; 0.005). Our findings suggest that SGDM levels are related to conventional seminal parameters, and could be used as a marker of testis function and spermatogenesis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fresh dairy cows (n = 102) were selected and milked in Lely Astronaut[&#174;] A3 milking robots. The rumination time (RT), body weight (BW), milk content and composition parameters, milk fat/protein ratio (F/P), and milk electrical conductivity were registered by the same milking robots. For examining non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), blood samples were acquired from cows in the dry period. According to the NEFA concentrations, all cows were divided into two groups: Group I, with &lt;0.300 mEq/L (n = 66), and Group II, with &#8805;0.300 mEq/L (n = 36). Albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and cortisol concentrations were also analyzed once a week up to 30 days in milking. The study revealed that the cows in Group I had higher concentrations of ALB, cortisol, and GGT, but the average concentration of AST was lower. In Group 1, the milk F/P was higher, but the milk yield was lower. We hypothesize that biomarkers from AMS could help in the early diagnosis of metabolic diseases after calving or to control negative energy balance before calving.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was designed to compare cytokines between healthy dogs and dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis. For the canine cytokine antibody array, three healthy dogs and three dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis were included. Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-&#945; were not detected in either group based on the results. Conversely, IL-8 (p = 0.035), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP)-1 (p = 0.0138), Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) (p = 0.0079), and stem cell factor (SCF) (p = 0.034) were significantly increased in dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis. However, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (p = 0.6971) did not differ significantly between groups. For the canine serum Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), eight healthy dogs and eight dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis were included. ELISA revealed that IL-8 (p &lt; 0.0001), MCP-1 (p &lt; 0.0001), RAGE (p = 0.006), and SCF (p = 0.0002) were all significantly upregulated in the experimental group. We confirmed multiple patterns of cytokines in suspected acute pancreatitis of dogs via canine cytokine antibody array using a small quantity of serum. After this procedure, we reevaluated the cytokines, which were significantly increased in dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis, by ELISA, with more samples. Through this study, we confirmed that MCP-1, RAGE, and SCF were newly suggested factors in dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The findings indicate that China was the main transgressor country for both types of notifications. Official controls were responsible for most FCM serious alerts (91.78%), and border rejection (90.82%) notifications. Another novelty proposed herein, is the criterion for "lag phases" (time from sampling to notification dates). Overall percentage distributions of lag phases, for all RASFF Member States, for the intervals of 0-50 days and 51-&#8805;101 days, were 25.09% and 67.87% for serious alert notifications and 65.21% and 29.34% for serious border rejection notifications. Differences in percent shares of lag phase intervals were observed between the top-four notifying countries, indicating a lack of harmonization in timely reporting of serious alert and border rejection notifications for FCM. Migration of primary aromatic amines and of metals were the most frequently notified hazards overall in the period of analysis. A decreasing trend is observed in the two more recent biannual averages of serious alert notifications for primary aromatic amines and metals, while decreasing for metals but increasing for primary aromatic amines in serious border rejection notifications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33806121</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serial Ultrasonographic and Real-Time Elastosonographic Assessment of the Ovine Common Calcaneal Tendon, after an Experimentally Induced Tendinopathy.</Title>	<Abstract>Real-time elastosonography (RTE) is a recently described, non-invasive, ultrasonographic technique developed to assess tissue elasticity. The main aim of this study was to investigate the ultrasonographic and elastosonographic appearance of the common calcaneal tendon (CCT) in an ovine model, and to monitor the progression of tendon healing after an experimentally-induced tendinopathy. Sound tendons were initially evaluated (T0) with a caliper and by a single operator with ultrasound. Ultrasonographic and elastosonographic images were then acquired. Subsequently, ultrasound-guided tendon lesions were induced by injecting 500 IU of Type IA collagenases proximally to the calcaneal tuberosity. Caliper measurement, ultrasonography and elastosonography were then repeated at 15 (T1), 30 (T2) and 60 (T3) days. Clinically measured width of the tendon, ultrasonographic thickness and width and percentage of hard (Elx-t%hrd) and soft (Elx-t%sft) tissue were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed on the data collected; statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) revealed good (0.68) repeatability of elastosonographic evaluation of the CCT. The tendon width was significantly increased when comparing T0 with T1-2 and decreased when comparing T1-2 with T3. Ultrasound-assessed thickness was significantly increased between T0-T1 and decreased between T1-T2-3. Elx-t%hrd was significantly decreased at T1-2-3 and Elx-t%sft was significantly increased at T1-2-3. In conclusion, the ovine CCT is a highly stiff structure that undergoes a severe loss of stiffness during the healing process. Thickness and width of the tendon increased during the first 30 days and then reduced progressively along the subsequent 30 days. Ultrasonographic appearance of the tendon remained severely abnormal and the tendon showed severely reduced elastic proprieties 60 days after lesion induction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While intrinsic and innate immune functions of PML NBs or PML NB core proteins are well defined in the context of nuclear replicating DNA viruses, several studies also confirm their substantial roles in the context of RNA viruses. In the present review, antiviral activities of PML NBs or its core proteins on diverse RNA viruses that replicate in cytoplasm or the nucleus were discussed. In addition, viral counter mechanisms that reorganize PML NBs, and specifically how viruses usurp PML NB functions in order to create a cellular environment favorable for replication and pathogenesis, are also discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Changes in the parasitic fauna of horses have occurred in the past few decades, making cyathostomins the major parasites in adult horses, while large strongyles have become less prevalent. Parascaris spp. remains the most important parasite infecting foals and weanlings. Anthelmintic resistance is highly prevalent in cyathostomins and Parascaris spp. worldwide and it must be factored into treatment decisions. To assess anthelmintic efficacy in Northern Italy, we sampled 215 horses from 17 sport and horse-breeding farms. Fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) were used to assess anthelmintic efficacy. Copromicroscopic analysis was performed using MiniFLOTAC before treatment with fenbendazole, pyrantel pamoate or ivermectin, and repeated 14 days post-treatment. Strongyle-type eggs were detected in 66.91% of horses (CI95% 61.40-73.79%), while Parascaris spp. was detected in 2.79% (CI95% 1.94-5.95%). Reduced efficacy against cyathostomins was observed for fenbendazole in 55.56% of the treated animals (CI95% 41.18-69.06%), and for pyrantel pamoate in 75% of animals (CI95% 30.06-95.44%). Ground-based actions must be set in place to promote the uptake of state-of-the-art worm control plans that will prevent clinical disease while minimizing the selection pressure of resistant parasites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33808746</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Isolation and Characterization of Yeasts from Rumen Fluids for Potential Use as Additives in Ruminant Feeding.</Title>	<Abstract>Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast strain often used to improve the feed quality of ruminants. However, S. cerevisiae has limited capacity to provide biomass when inoculated with carbon sources and a low ability to produce cellulase enzymes. Here, we hypothesized that yeast in the rumen produces a large amount of biomass and could release cellulase enzymes to break down fiber content. Therefore, the aim of this study was to screen, isolate and identify yeast from the rumen fluids of Holstein Friesian steers and measure the efficiency of biomass production and cellulase activity. A fermentation medium containing sugarcane molasses as a carbon source and urea as a nitrogen source was optimized. Two fistulated-crossbred Holstein Friesian steers averaging 350 &#177; 20 kg body weight were used to screen and isolate the ruminal yeast. Two experiments were designed: First, a 12 &#215; 3 &#215; 3 factorial was used in a completely randomized design to determine biomass and carboxymethyl cellulase activity. Factor A was the isolated yeast and S. cerevisiae. Factor B was sugarcane molasses (M) concentration. Factor C was urea (U) concentration. In the second experiment, potential yeasts were selected, identified, and analyzed for 7 &#215; 4 factorial use in a completely randomized design. Factor A was the incubation times. Factor B was the isolated yeast strains, including codes H-Khon Kaen University (KKU) 20 (as P. kudriavzevii-KKU20), I-KKU20 (C. tropicalis-KKU20), and C-KKU20 (as Galactomyces sp.-KKU20). Isolation was imposed under aerobic conditions, resulting in a total of 11 different colonies. Two appearances of colonies including asymmetric colonies of isolated yeast (indicated as A, B, C, E, and J) and ovoid colonies (coded as D, F, G, H, I, and K) were noted. Isolated yeast from the rumen capable of providing a high amount of biomass when inoculant consisted of the molasses 15% + urea 3% (M15 + U3), molasses 25% + urea 1% (M25 + U1), molasses 25% + urea 3% (M25 + U3), and molasses 25% + urea 5% (M25 + U5) when compared to the other media solution (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, 11 isolated biomass-producing yeasts were found in the media solution of M25 + U1. There were 4 isolates cellulase producing yeasts discovered in the media solution of M25 + U1 and M25 + U5 whereas molasses 5% + urea 1% (M5 + U1), molasses 5% + urea 3% (M5 + U3), molasses 5% + urea 5% (M5 + U5), molasses 15% + urea 1% (M15 + U1), molasses 15% + urea 3% (M5 + U3), and M25 + U3 were found with 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, and 2 isolates, respectively. Ruminal yeast strains H-KKU20, I-KKU20, and C-KKU20 were selected for their ability to produce biomass. Identification of isolates H-KKU20 and I-KKU20 revealed that those isolates belonged to Pichia kudriavzevii-KKU20 and Candida tropicalis-KKU20 while C-KKU20 was identified as Galactomyces sp.-KKU20. Two strains provided maximum cell growth: P. kudriavzevii-KKU20 (9.78 and 10.02 Log cell/mL) and C. tropicalis-KKU20 (9.53 and 9.6 Log cells/mL) at 60 and 72 h of incubation time, respectively. The highest ethanol production was observed in S. cerevisiae at 76.4, 77.8, 78.5, and 78.6 g/L at 36, 48, 60, and 72 h of incubation time, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). The P. kudriavzevii-KKU20 yielded the least reducing sugar at about 30.6 and 29.8 g/L at 60 and 72 h of incubation time, respectively. The screening and isolation of yeasts from rumen fluids resulted in 11 different yeasts being obtained. The potential yeasts discovered in the rumen fluid of cattle were Pichia kudriavzevii-KKU20, Candida tropicalis-KKU20, and Galactomyces sp.-KKU20. P. kudriavzevii-KKU20 had higher results than the other yeasts in terms of biomass production, cellulase enzyme activity, and cell number.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A live-attenuated and killed vaccine is currently immunized to control IBV infection; however, repeated outbreaks occur in both unvaccinated and vaccinated birds due to the choice of inadequate vaccine candidates and continuous emergence of novel infectious bronchitis (IB) variants and failure of vaccination. However, similar clinical signs were shown in different respiratory diseases that are essential to improving the diagnostic assay to detect IBV infections. Various risk factors involved in the failure of IB vaccination, such as various routes of application of vaccination, the interval between vaccinations, and challenge with various possible immunosuppression of birds are reviewed. The review article also highlights and updates factors affecting the diagnosis of IBV disease in the poultry industry with differential diagnosis to find the nature of infections compared with non-IBV diseases. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the common reasons for failed IBV vaccinations with preventive action, and proper diagnostic facilities for identifying the infective stage, leading to earlier control and reduced economic losses from IBV disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To better study how this organism could contribute to the aetiology of DDD, improved animal models that are more reflective of human disc anatomy, biology and mechanical properties are required. Against this background, our proof-of concept study aimed to be the first demonstration that C. acnes could be safely administered percutaneously into sheep intervertebral discs (IVDs) for in vivo study. Following our protocol, two sheep were successfully injected with a strain of C. acnes (8.3 &#215; 10[6] CFU/disc) previously recovered from a human degenerative disc. No adverse reactions were noted, and at one-month post inoculation all triplicate infected discs in our first animal grew C. acnes, albeit at a reduced load (5.12 &#215; 10[4] to 6.67 &#215; 10[4] CFU/disc). At six months, no growth was detected in discs from our second animal indicating bacterial clearance. This pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of safe percutaneous injection of C. acnes into sheep IVDs under fluoroscopic guidance. The design of follow-up sheep studies to investigate the potential of C. acnes to drive pathological changes within infected discs should now be pursued.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both the efficacy and/or safety of ECT were evaluated as a sole therapy with bleomycin to treat feline nasal planum SCC (npSCC). Sixty-one cats were enrolled. Local treatment response was evaluated as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD). Recurrence rate (RR), disease-free interval (DFI) and progression free survival (PFS) were calculated. A six-point scale was used for ECT toxicity. The median tumor size was 1.5 cm. CR was achieved in 65.6% of cases, PR in 31.1% and SD in 3.3%. The overall response rate was 96.7%, RR was 22.5%, median DFI was 136 days, and median PFS was 65.5 days. ECT toxicity was &#8804;2 in 51% of cats. Tumor recurrence/progression (p = 0.014) and local treatment response (PR: p &lt; 0.001; SD: p &lt; 0.001) influenced survival time. Cats with toxicity &gt;2 showed a higher probability of tumor recurrence/progression. Tumor-related death was higher in cats with PR (p &lt; 0.001) and recurrence/progression (p = 0.002), in ECT treatment with 1 Hz (p = 0.035) and 1200 V/cm (p = 0.011) or 1300 V/cm (p = 0.016). Tumor size influenced local treatment response (p = 0.008) and toxicity (p &lt; 0.001). ECT is an effective treatment for feline npSCCs and should be considered as the first-line procedure for low-stage tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33915951</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Variation in the Distribution of Nosema Species in Honeybees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) between the Neighboring Countries Estonia and Latvia.</Title>	<Abstract>The unicellular spore-forming parasites Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are considered to be one of the causes of increased honey bee mortality in recent years. These pathogens attack their honey bee hosts through their gut, causing changes in behavioral stress responses and possibly resulting in decreased honey yield and increased honey bee mortality. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Nosema spp. (nosemosis) in Estonia and Latvia, as well as the persistence of the disease in previously infected hives. Currently, N. ceranae is considered the most virulent species and is predominant worldwide. However, in some regions, usually with colder climates, N. apis is still prevalent. To achieve better disease control, it is important to determine the species distribution. For this purpose, we selected 30 apiaries in Estonia and 60 in Latvia that were positive for Nosema spp. in the EPILOBEE (2012-2014) study, which was 5 years prior to the present study. The results show that, while both species are present in Estonia and Latvia, N. apis is dominant in Estonia (43%), and N. ceranae is dominant in Latvia (47%). We also found that the pathogens are very persistent, since 5 years later, only 33% of infected apiaries in Estonia and 20% of infected apiaries in Latvia, we could not detect any pathogens at the time of sampling.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This disease has a major social impact and high treatment costs. Animal models allow us to understand and follow the colon cancer progression; thus, in vivo studies are essential to improve and discover new ways of prevention and treatment. Dietary natural products have been under investigation for better and natural prevention, envisioning to show their potential. This manuscript intends to provide the readers a review of rodent colorectal cancer models available in the literature, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their potential in the evaluation of several drugs and natural compounds' effects on colorectal cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33917796</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparing Potential Drug-Drug Interactions in Companion Animal Medications Using Two Electronic Databases.</Title>	<Abstract>Multiple-drug prescriptions can cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which increase risks associated with healthcare in veterinary medicine. Moreover, many human medicines are used in canine patients under the responsibility of veterinarians and may cause severe problems due to off-label use. Currently, many electronic databases are being used as tools for potential DDI prediction, for example, Micromedex and Drugs.com, which may benefit the prediction of potential DDIs for drugs used in canine. The purpose of this study was to examine different abilities for the identification of potential DDIs in companion animal medicine, especially in canine patients, by Micromedex and Drugs.com. Micromedex showed 429 pairs of potential DDIs, while Drugs.com showed 842 pairs of potential DDIs. The analysis comparing results between the two databases showed 139 pairs (12.28%) with the same severity and 993 pairs (87.72%) with different severities. The major mechanisms of contraindicated and major potential DDIs were cytochrome P450 induction-inhibition and QT interval prolongation. Veterinarians should interpret potential DDIs from several databases with caution and keep in mind that the results might not be reliable due to differences in sensitivity to drugs, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and elimination pathway between animals and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A study was conducted in 12 adult, non-pregnant Belgian Blue cows. To evaluate the plasma penicillin concentrations, blood samples were taken from the jugular vein at -5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, 480 min relative to the intramuscular (IM) injection of 21,000 IU/kg of body weight of penicillin G. Results showed that plasma concentrations at 15 min after IM injection (668.3 &#177; 73.7 ng/mL) largely exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin-sensitive bacteria (MIC &lt; 125 ng/mL). With increasing time, plasma concentrations continued to rise, attaining an increasing proportion of moderately sensitive bacteria (250 ng/mL &gt; MIC &lt; 2000 ng/mL). The maximal concentration was reached between 1 and 4 h (average: 1.495.1 &#177; 181.7 ng/mL) after IM injection in the majority of cows, and decreased non-significantly to 1002.1 &#177; 93.2 ng/mL at 8 h. In conclusion, plasma penicillin concentrations at 15 min after an IM injection inhibit penicillin-sensitive bacteria. However, in order to obtain the maximal protective effect of the antibiotherapy, surgery should be started at 1 to 2 h after IM penicillin injection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Consumption of contaminated poultry meat is regarded as the main source of human infection. This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and the molecular epidemiology of 205 Campylobacter isolates derived from Greek flocks slaughtered in three different slaughterhouses over a 14-month period. A total of 98.5% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. In terms of multidrug resistance, 11.7% of isolates were resistant to three or more groups of antimicrobials. Extremely high resistance to fluoroquinolones (89%), very high resistance to tetracycline (69%), and low resistance to macrolides (7%) were detected. FlaA sequencing was performed for the subtyping of 64 C. jejuni and 58 C. coli isolates. No prevalence of a specific flaA type was observed, indicating the genetic diversity of the isolates, while some flaA types were found to share similar antimicrobial resistance patterns. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Seven clusters of the C. jejuni phylogenetic tree and three clusters of the C. coli tree were considered significant with bootstrap values &gt;75%. Some isolates clustered together were originated from the same or adjacent farms, indicating transmission via personnel or shared equipment. These results are important and help further the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. derived from poultry in Greece.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33920469</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prolonged Infection of Canine Distemper Virus in a Mixed-Breed Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a major viral pathogen in domestic dogs, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, in the Morbillivirus genus. It is present worldwide, and a wide range of domestic animals and wild carnivores are at risk. In the absence of vaccination, dogs have a low chance of survival; however, if and when a dog survives, it can take an average of a few weeks to a few months to fully wipe out the virus. In the present study, we traced the course of infection of a 1-year-old mixed-breed male dog. The animal had an unusually long course of persistent CDV infection with a vector-borne heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) co-infection. The dog excreted the CDV for 17 months with PCR positivity in urine samples collected from February 2019 through June 2020. The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene revealed the CDV to be the member of the endemic Arctic-like genetic lineage. To the best of our knowledge, this report represents the longest documented canine infection of CDV. Notably, we highlight the necessity regarding CDV infectivity studies to better comprehend the transmission attributes of the virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A survey on endoparasites in dairy goat farms of north-eastern Italy was conducted to test a monitoring approach based on a farm-tailored sample size. Farm management and parasites control practices were investigated in 20 farms through a questionnaire survey. Further, fecal samples were collected (November 2018-September 2019) from 264 animals from 13 farms and were analyzed individually with a modified McMaster method and subsequently pooled to perform a coproculture. Coccidia (78.4%), gastrointestinal strongyles (37.9%), Strongyloides (28.4%), Skrjabinema (18.9%), Trichuris (8.0%) and Nematodirus/Marshallagia (0.4%) were identified. Abundances were higher for coccidia and gastrointestinal strongyles. Haemonchus (71%) was the dominant gastrointestinal nematode. Pasture and age class resulted in the main risk factors at the multivariable analysis through a negative binomial regression model. Results from farm monitoring indicate that our approach can be a cost-effective decision tool to target treatments more effectively, but farmers need to be educated about the importance of parasitological testing, which is currently scarcely implemented, against the risk of AR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33922570</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Survey-Based Analysis of Current Trends for Prescribing Gastrointestinal Protectants among Small-Animal General Practitioners in Portugal.</Title>	<Abstract>In both human and veterinary healthcare, gastrointestinal protectants (GIPs) are considered a staple of clinical practice in that they are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) and specialists alike. Concerning GIP use, overprescription of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has become a growing concern among human healthcare providers. This trend has also been documented within veterinary practice, prompting the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) to publish a consensus statement in 2018 concerning evidence-based indications for GIP use. This observational cross-sectional study evaluated self-reported prescribing protocols among Portuguese GPs to determine whether there is adherence to the consensus guidelines. Respondents were Portuguese GPs recruited by social media posts in veterinarian online forums. Data were collected from 124 respondents concerning their GIPs of choice and their rationales for prescribing them. Data were mined for prescription patterns and protocols. Among GIPs, PPIs were prescribed more often. Rationales for use included gastrointestinal ulceration and erosion (GUE), prophylactic management of nonerosive gastritis, pancreatitis, reflux esophagitis, and steroid-induced ulceration. Once-daily administration of PPIs was the most frequent dosing regime among respondents. Ninety-six percent of PPI prescribers advocated that the drug be administered either shortly before or at mealtime. Forty-nine percent of respondents supported long-term use of PPIs. Fifty-nine percent of respondents acknowledged discontinuing PPIs abruptly. This study supports that Portuguese GPs commonly prescribe GIPs in accordance with ACVIM recommendations to medically manage GUE. However, misuse of GIPs does occur, and they have been prescribed where their therapeutic value is debatable. Educational strategies should target GPs in an effort to reduce GIP misuse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33922817</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Successful Treatment of Mucocutaneous Lupus Erythematosus in a Dog with Prednisolone, Mycophenolate Mofetil and Tacrolimus.</Title>	<Abstract>A 6-year-old, intact male miniature Pinscher dog had erosive lesions on perilabial, peripenial and perianal mucocutaneous areas, which were exacerbated by ulcerations, crusts, with pain while defecating and urinating. The lesions were symmetrical, and no systemic signs were observed. Histopathological evaluation showed parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, ulceration and cell-rich lymphoplasmacytic interface dermatitis with basal keratinocyte apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong reaction in the dermoepidermal junction against goat-canine IgG and mild-to-moderate reaction against goat-canine IgA, IgM and C3. Based on these findings, the dog was diagnosed with mucocutaneous lupus erythematosus (MCLE). Oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 18.3 mg/kg twice daily and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment were prescribed as initial treatment. The lesions showed remarkable improvement within 4 weeks, but the dog exhibited polyuria, polydipsia and hepatomegaly with high dosage of prednisolone. Hence, the dosage of prednisolone was gradually tapered for 9 weeks and discontinued, but MMF and tacrolimus were continued. No new lesion or associated side effect was observed while reducing the MMF dose to 10 mg/kg twice daily and with continuous use of tacrolimus ointment after steroid discontinuation. In conclusion, this case report emphasizes the usefulness of MMF and tacrolimus as steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of dogs with MCLE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of MCLE that was successfully managed long-term with MMF and tacrolimus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33922826</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Salmonella Gallinarum in Small-Scale Commercial Layer Flocks: Occurrence, Molecular Diversity and Antibiogram.</Title>	<Abstract>Salmonella Gallinarum is one of the most important bacterial pathogens associated with diminished egg production in poultry. The aim of this study was to understand the occurrence, molecular traits and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella Gallinarum strains isolated from small-scale commercial layer flocks with low level biosecurity standards in Bangladesh. A total of 765 samples, including cloacal swabs (535), visceral organs (50), and droppings (180), were collected from chickens of 12 layer flocks in 11 districts. Salmonella Gallinarum was isolated and characterized through culture-based method, followed by biochemical tests, sero-grouping, PCR assays, sequencing, and antibiogram. The identity of biochemically detected isolates of Salmonella Gallinarum was confirmed via genus-specific 16S rRNA gene based PCR, followed by invA and spvC genes based PCR assays. Occurrence of Salmonella Gallinarum was detected in overall 25.75% (197/765) samples, with a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher incidence in visceral organs (42%) in comparison to cloacal swab (24%) and droppings (26%). Sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis of invA and spvC genes in representative strains of Salmonella Gallinarum revealed a close genetic lineage, with a sequence similarity of 98.05-99.21% and 97.51-99.45%, respectively, to previously published sequences of the corresponding genes from the same serogroup strains. Remarkably, 66.5% (131/197) of the isolated strains of Salmonella Gallinarum were found to be resistant to 3 to 6 antimicrobial agents, and interpreted as multidrug resistant (MDR). The findings of this study underscore an inherent need of appropriate control measures to curb the widespread incidence of MDR Salmonella Gallinarum in small-scale commercial layer flocks, thereby, facilitating enhanced egg production and further support to the food security and safety in low resource settings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33923535</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>A Case of Infectious Laryngotracheitis in an Organic Broiler Chicken Farm in Greece.</Title>	<Abstract>Infectious laryngotracheitis is an economically significant viral disease of chickens, that mainly affects the upper respiratory tract, and is present worldwide. This case reports the first outbreak of infectious laryngotracheitis in a four-week-old organic broiler farm and surrounding flocks in Greece, with typical clinical symptoms and lesions, allegedly provoked by a wild strain of infectious laryngotracheitis virus. Our findings contradict the general perception indicating that the disease appears mainly in older birds and that vaccine strains are the primary cause of infectious laryngotracheitis outbreaks in most continents. A recombinant vectored vaccine was administered, supplementary to biosecurity measures, containing the viral spread. The responsible strain was potentially circulating in the area; therefore, an industry-wide holistic approach was applied, including the vaccination of neighboring broilers and breeders with the same vaccine, the rapid molecular diagnosis of the disease, and strict biosecurity protocols. The results of this holistic effort were effective because, following the application of vaccine and management protocols, manifestations of the disease in regional flocks dropped significantly, and there was no recurrence to date. These findings suggest that vaccination protocols should be modified, especially for organic broilers, to include vaccination against infectious laryngotracheitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Given the rapid growth of human populations in some regions like Costa Rica, pathogens introduced, sustained, and transmitted by domestic carnivores may be particularly important. To better understand the significance of domestic carnivore pathogens for wildlife, we determine the prevalence of infection and possible mechanisms for contact between the two groups. The demographics, role in the household, and pathogens of pet dogs and cats was studied during three annual spay/neuter clinics in San Luis, Costa Rica. Most dogs were owned primarily as pets and guard animals, but ~10% were used for hunting. Cats were owned primarily as pets and for pest control. Both roamed freely outdoors. We detected high prevalences of some pathogens (e.g., carnivore protoparvovirus 1 and Toxoplasma gondii). Some pathogens are known to persist in the environment, which increases the probability of exposure to wild carnivores. This study demonstrated that domestic pets in San Luis, home to a number of protected and endangered wildlife species, are infected with pathogens to which these wild species are potentially susceptible. Additionally, results from our questionnaire support the potential for domestic and wild animal contact, which may result in disease spillover.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of different breeding techniques and a prolonged post dry aging (PDA) maturation process on biomolecules level in raw buffalo meat. In the first experiment, two groups of animals were maintained with different space availability (15 vs. 10 m[2]/animal) for 90 days and biomolecules content was evaluated. In experiment 2, two diets (with or without ryegrass green forage) were used to assess the concentration of these biomolecules. Finally, in experiment 3, the meat of the animals that showed the highest content of biomolecules was chosen to assess the influence of the PDA maturation process. Buffaloes reared at 15 m[2] showed a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher content of the considered biomolecules compared with their counterparts. Similarly, buffaloes fed green forage showed higher content of biomolecules (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group. The meat of the animals bred at 15 m[2] and fed green forage showed a significant (p &lt; 0.01) increase of biomolecules content during the PDA maturation process up to 60 days without influence microbiological profile in terms of total aerobic bacterial counts, yeasts, and molds. In conclusion, breeding techniques and PDA maturation system could enhance biomolecules levels in terms of quality, without affect health standards.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is scant literature on the use of clinical audit in the farm animal veterinary setting. This study describes the process and feasibility of prospective and retrospective data collection for farm animal clinical audit performed at three different farm animal practices in the United Kingdom. Retrospective clinical audit was difficult in all three practices due to barriers in establishing diagnosis and patient identity from clinical records. Prospective data collection proved feasible but depended on adequate case accrual and practitioner engagement. The decision to conduct clinical audit retrospectively or prospectively will depend on the topic to audit, the availability of data and the wishes of the team members involved. Further work is required looking at the use of clinical coding and alternatives to using practice management software to improve retrospective data availability for clinical audit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

SBV variants and strains identified in Asian honey bees, Apis cerana, have created confusion in identifications. Although the regional names indicated the expansions of the virus in new regions, pathogenesis, and genomes of these variants are not distinct enough to be a separate virus species. However, current SBV qPCR methods may not detect newly identified A. cerana SBV variants (Ac SBV) according to the genome sequences. Since these Ac SBV can naturally infect A. mellifera and possibly other hymenopterans, ignorance of Ac SBV variants in detection methods is simply unwise. In this report, we updated the qPCR method based on Blanchard's design that used conserved regions of VP1 to design a TaqMan method with an MGB (minor groove binder) probe. We tested the method in bees and hornets, including A. mellifera, A. cerana, and Vespa velutina. The updated primers and the probe can match published SBV and Ac SBV genomes in databases, and this updated method has reasonable sensitivity and flexibility to be applied as a detection and quantification method before the discovery of variants with more mutated VP1 gene.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Samples of nasal secretions were obtained from 50 red-motley Holstein calves aged 14-42 days. Calves were subjected to rectal temperature measurements, clinical score according to the Wisconsin respiratory scoring chart, thoracic auscultation, and radiography (Carestream DR, New York, USA). Of the 50 calves, we included samples from 40 (20 "healthy" and 20 "sick") in the training sample. The remaining ten calves (five "healthy" and five "sick") were included in the test sample. It was possible to divide calves into "healthy" and "sick" groups according to the output data of the sensor arrays (maximum sensor signals and calculated parameters Ai/j) using the principal component linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) with an accuracy of 100%. The adequacy of the PCA-LDA model was verified on a test sample. It was found that data of sensors with films of carbon nanotubes, zirconium nitrate, hydroxyapatite, methyl orange, bromocresol green, and Triton X-100 had the most significance for dividing samples into groups. The differences in the composition of the gaseous phase over the samples of nasal secretions for such a classification could be explained by the appearance or change in the concentrations of ketones, alcohols, organic carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amines, including cyclic amines or those with a branched hydrocarbon chain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A convenience sample of 100 primary-care veterinary practitioners was selected from the city of Medellin. A questionnaire was designed to present hypothetical clinical scenarios regarding prescription choices for systemic antimicrobials. The numbers of veterinarians empirically prescribing a course of systemic antimicrobials for each scenario were-perioperative elective surgeries (86%), superficial pyoderma (90%), lower urinary tract disease (52%), acute hemorrhagic diarrhea (50%), and kennel cough (46%). For urinary tract disease, cultures and susceptibility testing were only performed by half of the respondents, suggesting lower diagnostic standards. In superficial pyoderma cases, cytology was performed in the following percent of cases-0% (24), 20% (30), 40% (17), 60% (11), 80% (8), and 100% (10). Antimicrobials were over-prescribed relative to emerging standard for elective surgeries (86%), kennel cough (46%), and acute hemorrhagic diarrhea (50%). Critically important antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolones, were applied commonly for superficial pyoderma (18%), kennel cough (12%), and lower urinary tract disease in dogs (20%) and cats (26%). In conclusion, antimicrobial prescribing behavior was inconsistent with current guidelines, and antimicrobial use could be improved by appropriate diagnostic steps allowing choice of an optimal antimicrobial drug. Overall, we documented the widespread use of antimicrobials for the treatment of these four common disease conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Following a routine technique, triploidy was induced by cold shock and confirm by erythrocyte measurement in C. gariepinus. Thereafter, 80 RAPD markers were screened; out of which, three showed the highest percentage of polymorphism (i.e., OPB 16 = 71.43%; OPC 14 = 61.9%; OPD 12 = 75%). The results obtained showed genotype differences between triploid and diploid without overlapping. However, the development of a Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) marker was not achievable because progenies of triploid and diploid C. gariepinus could not be differentiated based on a specific fragment. Consequently, the genetic distance showed high similarities for both treatments and the UPGMA-generated dendrogram could not separate the treatments into two distinct clusters. It was concluded that RAPD makers cannot be used to separate the ploidy status of fishes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The health and nutritional condition of honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) depends for an important part on management practices, and it is influenced by multiple factors. This study aims to identify the stressors that lead to the loss of honeybee health and its consequences on the colony's productivity. Different aspects related to management practices, productivity, clinical observations related to diseases, presence of sanitary gaps in the apiaries, colony strength, weather and infestation rates by Varroa sp. mites were measured. The information was collected during two monitoring in 53 apiaries in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. The results show correlations among many of the management practices, health condition and yield. The most important factors affecting the productivity of the studied honeybee colonies were nuclei preparation, the number of combs in the brood chamber, change of bee queen, disinfection of beekeeping material, among other less significant ones. Although honey production is important in the region, the colony strength was deficient and inadequate during both monitoring. Due to its dependence on management by the beekeeper, it is suggested that a holistic approach could improve bee health, increasing the productivity of honeybees.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A female cat was presented for clinical evaluation with gastrointestinal signs, oedema, erythema, and painful lesion in the right inguinal region. Three weeks later, the mass had doubled in size and radiographic revaluation of the thoracic cavity revealed a metastatic pattern. Due to the poor prognosis and decline of the clinical status the owners decided for euthanasia. Post-mortem examination exposed a mammary tumoral mass with subcutaneous oedema, an enlargement of the right inguinal lymph node, and nodules in several organs. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of large pleomorphic epithelial cells, often grouped in small clusters with bizarre nuclei. Immunohistochemical study of the different lesions was performed and both primary tumor and regional metastasis showed tumor cells to be negative estrogen receptor alpha, positive progesterone receptor, positive HER-2, and positive pan-cytokeratin. Given that the clinical history was compatible with an inflammatory mammary carcinoma, the cyclooxygenase-2 expression levels were evaluated and presented a weak immunoreactivity. Regarding the distant metastatic lesions, tumor cells were negative for ER-&#945; and PR and, positive both for HER-2 and pan-cytokeratin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the early stages, pluripotency, cellular differentiation, and growth should occur at specific times and these events are regulated by different genes that are expressed at specific times and locations. The genes related to pluripotency and cellular differentiation, and growth factors that determine successful embryonic development are different (or differentially expressed) among mammalian species. Some genes are fundamental for controlling pluripotency in some species but less fundamental in others, for example, Oct4 is particularly relevant in bovine early embryonic development, whereas Oct4 inhibition does not affect ovine early embryonic development. In addition, some mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation do not seem to be clear or evolutionarily conserved. After cellular differentiation, growth factors are relevant in early development, and their effects also differ among species, for example, insulin-like growth factor improves the blastocyst development rate in some species but does not have the same effect in mice. Some growth factors influence genes related to pluripotency, and therefore, their role in early embryo development is not limited to cell growth but could also involve the earliest stages of development. In this review, we summarize the differences among mammalian species regarding the regulation of pluripotency, cellular differentiation, and growth factors in the early stages of embryonic development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although Jeju horses are a prominent local breed in Korea, few studies have investigated the gut microbiota of Jeju horses; (2) Methods: This study performed sequencing of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the partial 16S rRNA genes obtained from horse fecal samples and compared the gut microbiota between Jeju and Thoroughbred horses. Thirty and 24 fecal samples were obtained from Jeju and Thoroughbred horses, respectively; (3) Results: The gut microbiota belonged to 23 phyla and 159 families. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant and predominant phyla, followed by Verrucomicrobia, Euryachaeota, and Spirochaete. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B), which is known as a relevant marker of gut dysbiosis, was 1.84 for Jeju horses, whereas it was 1.76 for Thoroughbred horses. Moreover, at the genus level, 21 genera were significantly different between the Jeju and Thoroughbred horses (p &lt; 0.05); (4) Conclusions: The Thoroughbred horse's gut microbiotas had significantly higher diversity than the Jeju horses (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, beneficial commensal bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids thus providing a significant source of energy are also more abundant in Thoroughbred horses. These results provide novel information on the horse gut microbiota and insights for further studies related to the horse gut microbiota.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The survey revealed that 19% and 10% of large and small animal veterinarians indicated they sterilized and reused disposable needles. Veterinarians among all practices indicated high rates (75% to 80%) of recapping needles before disposal. When handling an animal suspected of having a zoonotic disease, most (90%) of small animal veterinarians reported always using practices such as isolating the animal and removing outwear before contact with other animals. However, only half (55%) of the large animal respondents reported always isolating the animal or sterilizing all equipment used on the animal of concern. Fewer than half of the large animal (35%) and mixed practice (44%) veterinarians indicated they would always be limiting human contact with the animal of concern. All of the small animal respondents reported full compliance with PPE while performing surgery and necropsy. Among large animal veterinarians, 44% reported not using respiratory or eye protection when aiding with parturition or handling conception products. Failure to use appropriate PPE when handling blood samples was the second most common noncompliant practice among large animal (39%) veterinarians and mixed practice (41%) respondents. Our study indicates a need for continuous education regarding ICPs in the veterinary community in the UAE. Better awareness of the risk of zoonotic disease exposure and options for managing this risk and liability issues could drive the adoption of infection control practices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we monitored the organochlorine contaminants in common swifts (Apus apus) in the years 2016 to 2018. These long-distance migrants breed in Europe and winter in Africa. Their only feeding source is aerial plankton. Pooled organ samples of 42 adult and 40 juvenile swifts were tested with the multi-residue method by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS). Predominantly, 4,4'-DDE, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lindane and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in most of these common swifts. Only 4,4'-DDE (adult: 83 &#177; 70 &#956;g/kg, juvenile: 17 &#177; 39 &#956;g/kg) and dieldrin (adult: 2 &#177; 3 &#956;g/kg, juvenile: 0.3 &#177; 1 &#956;g/kg) concentrations were significantly different between adult and juvenile birds. All detected concentrations in our study were far lower than the previously recorded pesticide concentrations of common swifts in Italy and those which are known to cause toxicity and death in birds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The dog was diagnosed as having small-bowel obstruction (SBO) due to intra-abdominal adhesions and small-bowel fecal material (SBFM) by using abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and laparotomy. We removed the obstructive adhesive lesion and SBFM through enterotomies and applied an autologous peritoneal graft to the released jejunum to prevent re-adhesion. After the surgical intervention, the dog recovered quickly and was healthy at 1 year after the surgery without gastrointestinal signs. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of a successful treatment of SBO induced by postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions and SBFM after laparotomies in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, the study of sperm morphology is a fundamental element in the seminal analysis, but its real meaning has been biased by the techniques used for its evaluation. These techniques involve dehydration phases and subsequent staining, which involves the production of artifacts. The aim of the study is to compare two methods for equid semen morphology evaluation, Trumorph[&#174;] using living sperm vs. eosin-nigrosine stain. A total of 49 ejaculates from stallions and donkeys were used. After semen collection and dilution, an aliquot was placed on the slide and introduced in the Trumorph[&#174;] device. Then observation was made with a 40x objective and negative phase-contrast microscope. Another aliquot was stained using eosin-nigrosine stain and viewed using 100&#215; magnification. Well-formed sperm were observed, and different abnormalities were identified using Trumorph[&#174;]. The use of eosin-nigrosin staining method and Trumorph[&#174;] led to the same results and both techniques can be used for stallion and donkey sperm morphological analysis. However, considering the fact that Trumorph[&#174;] uses living sperm helps prevent sperm cell alteration during sample preparation. Therefore, Trumorph[&#174;] can be a good alternative to the conventional staining method, which provides a quick test on live sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to investigate the burden of toxigenic C. difficile among diarrheic dogs and cats using direct PCR on fecal samples to reveal better insights about the epidemiology of such toxigenic strains referring to its public health significance. For this purpose, fecal samples were obtained from 58 dogs and 42 cats experiencing diarrhea. Following DNA extraction, the extracted DNA was examined for the occurrence of C. difficile as well as toxigenic strains through the detection of C. difficile 16S rRNA and toxin encoding genes (tcdA, tcdB, cdtA and cdtB) using PCR. Moreover, partial DNA sequencing of toxigenic strains retrieved from dog and cat was carried out. Of 100 examined diarrheic animals, 90 (90%) were C. difficile positive, including 93.1% and 85.7% of dogs and cats, respectively. In addition, toxigenic strains were detected in 13 animals, giving an overall prevalence 13% with the following prevalence rates among dogs and cats 12.1% and 14.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequence revealed high genetic relatedness of tcdA sequence obtained from a cat to strains of human diarrheic cases to point out the public health threat of such sequence. In conclusion, the direct detection of toxigenic C. difficile using PCR among dogs and cats highlights the potential role of household pets as a source for such strains to human contacts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These tumors are rarely described in horses, where they may develop due to cryptorchidism. Teratomas consist of cells originating from different germinal layers, arising from germinal multi-potential cells with differentiation defects, and can simultaneously contain several tissues from two or more embryonic layers. Testicular teratomas are described in horses, cats, dogs, wild boars, bulls, and humans. In the rare descriptions found in literature of testicular teratoma in stallions, they occur frequently in cryptorchid testicles, as a consequence of congenital neoplasm. To our knowledge there is no other report of a dentigerous equine teratoma in a stallion. We describe here a successful laparoscopic removal of a testicular teratoma and its clinic-pathological features.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our interest was to determine the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type and the antimicrobial susceptibility among MRS isolates from clinical cases. Skin swabs were collected and cultured. Staphylococcus species were identified and characterized with biochemical tests and MALDI-TOF-MS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion. mecA detection and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing were achieved by PCR. Of the 65 clinical samples, 56 (86.2%) staphylococcal infections were identified. Twelve (21%) of 56 isolates were MRS infections. All MRS isolates were multidrug resistant. The ccrC and class-C2 mec, which were SCCmec type V, were the most prevalent (66.7%) among the 12 MRS isolates. The predominant SCCmec type V was found in S. aureus, S. intermedius group, S. lentus, S. xylosus, and S. arlettae. Treatment failure is a concern with the emergence of highly resistant MRS in dogs associated with superficial pyoderma. The detection of type V SCCmec MRS has previously been reported among veterinarians and dog owners but not in Northern Thailand. These infections serve as a reminder to improve infection prevention and control measures including reducing environmental contamination and potential zoonotic exposures to MRS. In addition, educational awareness of these risks in small animal hospitals needs to be increased among veterinary hospital staff, clients, and patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study evaluated the inhibitory, fungicidal and sporicidal activity of ten essential oils extracted from aromatic plants against Ascosphaera apis, the etiological agent of chalkbrood, an invasive honey bee mycosis. The most effective essential oils were Thymus herba-barona, Thymus capitatus and Cinnamomum zeylanicum, which showed values of minimum fungicidal concentration and minimum sporicidal concentration ranging from 200 to 400 ppm. Carvacrol was the main component of Thymus capitatus and Thymus herba-barona oils, whereas cinnamic aldehyde prevailed in Cinnamomum&amp;nbsp;zeylanicum oil. Further in-apiary studies will allow the evaluation of side effects on bees and residues in hive products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Extra-adrenal paraganglioma occurs with a low incidence in both humans and animals. This report presents the first case of paraganglioma in a cat with orbital primary location. An 18-year-old spayed female European domestic shorthair cat of 3.60 kg body weight was evaluated in a private veterinary clinic in Perugia, Italy, for a pronounced exophthalmos of the right eye. The cat underwent surgery for the enucleation of the right eye and of the mass. The biopsy samples of the removed tissue were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. Therefore, specific markers were used for immunohistochemical investigations, such as anti-neuron specific enolase (NSE), anti-synaptophysin, anti-glial fibrillary acid protein, anti-cytokeratin and anti-chromogranin. The results of these investigations allowed establishing the final diagnosis of ocular extra-adrenal paraganglioma of the cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Isolation is still important for serotyping and genotyping of Leptospira, which in turn is essential for epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis and the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines. However, isolation of Leptospira from clinical specimens is inherently insensitive. This study was conducted to examine the influence of selective agents, sample filtration, sample pH and the use of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer for sample storage to improve the success of cultivation and isolation of Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae from swine urine. EMJH (Ellinghausen McCullough, Johnson and Harris) medium including the selective agents sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, amphotericin, fosfomycin and 5-fluorouracil (STAFF) increased the success of Leptospira isolation from spiked swine urine samples. Sample filtration yielded only negative results. Isolation in EMJH-STAFF was successful from swine urine with a density as low as 10[4]&amp;nbsp;Leptospira/mL, and urine with pH &#8804; 7 impaired the cultivation rate. Cultivation and isolation were not improved by the addition of PBS to spiked urine samples prior to storage for 24 h at 4 &#176;C. The results of the study demonstrate that cultivation and isolation of leptospires from swine urine can be improved by enhanced methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This project's aim was to visualize and measure the strain of the sound, injured, and healing SDFTs in a pony during walk and trot. For this purpose, biplanar high-speed fluoroscopic kinematography (FluoKin), as a high precision X-ray movement analysis tool, was used for the first time in vivo with equine tendons. The strain in the metacarpal region of the sound SDFT was 2.86% during walk and 6.78% during trot. When injured, the strain increased to 3.38% during walk and decreased to 5.96% during trot. The baseline strain in the mid-metacarpal region was 3.13% during walk and 6.06% during trot and, when injured, decreased to 2.98% and increased to 7.61%, respectively. Following tendon injury, the mid-metacarpal region contributed less to the overall strain during walk but showed increased contribution during trot. Using this marker-based FluoKin technique, direct, high-precision, and long-term strain measurements in the same individual are possible. We conclude that FluoKin is a powerful tool for gaining deeper insight into equine tendon biomechanics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed to assess the accuracy of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), protein carbonyls (PCO) and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) in differentiating dogs with sepsis from those with sterile inflammation and healthy ones, and predict the outcome in septic dogs. These analytes were retrospectively evaluated at admission in 92 dogs classified into healthy, septic and polytraumatized. Groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a Mann-Whitney U test to assess differences between survivors and non-survivors. Correlation between analytes was assessed using the Spearman's test, and their discriminating power was assessed through a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. PON1 and CRP were, respectively, significantly lower and higher in dogs with sepsis compared with polytraumatized and clinically healthy dogs (p &lt; 0.001 for both the analytes), and also in dogs with trauma compared with healthy dogs (p = 0.011 and p = 0.017, respectively). PCO were significantly increased in septic (p &lt; 0.001) and polytraumatized (p &lt; 0.005) as compared with healthy dogs. PON1 and CRP were, respectively, significantly lower and higher in dogs that died compared with survivors (p &lt; 0.001 for both analytes). Ultimately, evaluation of CRP and PON1 at admission seems a reliable support to diagnose sepsis and predict outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infection can result in hemolytic anemia, lethargy, anorexia, and death. The reservoir host of B. odocoilei is the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); however, infections with overt disease have only been documented in reindeer (Rangider tarandu tarandus), caribou (Rangider tarandu caribou) and captive elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis). Infected elk may remain asymptomatic, creating the risk for dissemination of the pathogen when elk are relocated. Additionally, infected asymptomatic elk may contribute to the spread of B. odocoilei in the local wildlife/captive population via feeding ticks. Information regarding endemic regions of B. odocoilei infection is limited due to frequent asymptomatic infections and a lack of targeted surveillance of B. odocoilei in wildlife. To obtain data on B. odocoilei infection in wild elk in Pennsylvania, we tested blood samples collected from 190 hunter-harvested wild elk between 2016 and 2017. Of the 190 blood samples tested, 18.4% (35/190) tested positive for Babesia spp. Genetic sequencing of the positive samples showed a 98.0-100.0% match for B. odocoilei. No other Babesia species were identified. Results of this study documents B. odocoilei infection within hunter-harvested wild elk from Pennsylvania.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-eight goats were used (23 BB, 7 BBSA and 8 SA). The composition (fat, protein, lactose and total solid; TS) in colostrum (Day 0; D0) and milk (Day 4; D4 and Day 7; D7) were measured. The IGF-1, IgG concentrations were analysed in some samples collected at D0, D4 and D7 while Vit A was analysed only in colostrum. The results showed that colostrum components were similar among experimental groups. However, the colostral IGF-1 concentration of BBSA (983.0 &#177; 163.6 ng/mL) was higher than that of BB (340.7 &#177; 85.5 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.01) and SA (417.1 &#177; 93.9 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.01). The colostral IgG concentration of BB (8.2 &#177; 0.9 mg/mL) was lower than that of BBSA (12.9 &#177; 1.7 mg/mL, p &lt; 0.05) and SA (12.9 &#177; 1.0 mg/mL, p &lt; 0.01). Colostral Vit A concentration in BBSA (787.2 &#177; 152.6 &#181;g/100 gm) was higher than that in BB (388.9 &#177; 84.3 &#181;g/100 gm, p &lt; 0.05) but was not different from SA (522.8 &#177; 96.9 &#181;g/100 gm). Colostrum from all groups contained higher protein and TS but was lower in lactose concentration than milk. The IGF-1 and IgG concentrations in colostrum were much higher than in milk both D4 and D7 (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, litter size had no effects on colostrum contents but colostrum from goats with a higher parity number had higher IgG concentration. It is concluded that colostrum from BBSA may be superior when fed to BB newborn goats in terms of higher IGF-1, IgG and Vit A contents. Moreover, colostrum from goats with a high parity number contained more IgG content.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its microbial composition can be influenced by several endogenous and exogenous factors. In the beef and dairy industry, the possibility to manipulate gut microbiota by diet and management can have important health and economic implications. The aims of this study were to characterize the different GIT site microbiota in water buffalo and evaluate the influence of diet on GIT microbiota in this animal species. We characterized and compared the microbiota of the rumen, large intestine and feces of water buffaloes fed two different diets with different non-structural carbohydrates/crude proteins (NSC/CP) ratios. Our results indicated that Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in all the GIT sites, with significant differences in microbiota composition between body sites both within and between groups. This result was particularly evident in the large intestine, where beta diversity analysis displayed clear clustering of samples depending on the diet. Moreover, we found a difference in diet digestibility linked to microbiota modification at the GIT level conditioned by NSC/CP levels. Diet strongly influences GIT microbiota and can therefore modulate specific GIT microorganisms able to affect the health status and performance efficiency of adult animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nevertheless, there is a gap of knowledge regarding the functionality of the ceca in poultry, especially with respect to physiological cecal smooth muscle contraction. The aim of the current study is the ex vivo characterization of cecal smooth muscle contraction in laying hens. Muscle strips of circular cecal smooth muscle from eleven hens are prepared to investigate their contraction ex vivo. Contraction is detected using an isometric force transducer, determining its frequency, height and intensity. Spontaneous contraction of the chicken cecal smooth muscle and the influence of buffers (calcium-free buffer and potassium-enriched buffer) and drugs (carbachol, nitroprusside, isoprenaline and Verapamil) affecting smooth muscle contraction at different levels are characterized. A decrease in smooth muscle contraction is observed when a calcium-free buffer is used. Carbachol causes an increase in smooth muscle contraction, whereas atropine inhibits contraction. Nitroprusside, isoprenaline and Verapamil result in a depression of smooth muscle contraction. In conclusion, the present results confirm a similar contraction behavior of cecal smooth muscles in laying hens as shown previously in other species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Teaching clinical reasoning is a challenge for veterinary instructors as many lack adequate training in clinical teaching. In this paper, we propose the use of the five-microskills (FMS; also known as the one-minute preceptor) model of clinical teaching as a tool that can be used not only in teaching during clinical encounters but also during traditional teaching sessions (e.g., practicals). The FMS model assists the instructor in estimating the level of knowledge and development of the learner and allows for providing feedback. The FMS model is applicable in the busy clinical or teaching schedule of the instructor and requires training only of the instructor, not the learner. We provide two examples of the use of the FMS model, one of a clinical encounter and the other a biochemistry practical. From the examples, readers should be able to extract the basis of the model and start using it in their day-to-day practice. For proper use of the model, 1-4 h of training is usually recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We determined the prevalence and factors associated with E. granulosus s.l. infection among owned dogs presented at veterinary clinics or hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria. Fecal samples from 217 dogs were screened for the presence of taeniid eggs using a sedimentation test in a cross sectional study. The taeniid eggs were identified at molecular level using a multiplex PCR. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain data on intrinsic and extrinsic factors from 133 dog owners. Out of the 217 dog fecal samples, 13 (6.0%) had taeniid eggs, of which 12 (92.3%) were identified as Echinococcus granulosus s.l. We found that Echinococcus granulosus infection is present among owned dogs in Lagos State with an overall prevalence of 5.5%. Location of the veterinary clinics or hospital and purpose for keeping dogs were significant factors associated with E. granulosus infection among owned dogs. Dogs living in suburban areas and kept for security purposes or guarding have higher probability of infection. Appropriate and regular treatment of dogs with praziquantel is highly recommended to reduce risk of E. granulosus transmission to humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed (I) to investigate expression profile of eca-miR-155, eca-miR-223, eca-miR-17, eca-miR-200a, and eca-miR-205 (II) and to measure concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), and prostaglandins (PGF2&#945; and PGE2) in serum of mares with healthy and abnormal uterine status (endometritis). This study was conducted on 80 Arabian mares: young (4-7 years), and old (8-14 years). Mares were divided into 48 sub-fertile (endometritis) and 32 fertile (control) at stud farms. Serum was collected for measuring IL-6, PGF2&#945;, and PGE2, as well as miRNA isolation and qRT-PCR. Concentrations of IL-6, PGE2, and PGF2&#945; were higher in mares with endometritis compared to control. Age of mares had a remarkable effect on IL-6, PGE2, and PGF2&#945; concentrations. Relative abundance of eca-miR-155, eca-miR-223, eca-miR-17, eca-miR-200a, and eca-miR-205 was higher in both young and old mares with endometritis. We noticed that eca-miR-155, eca-miR-223, eca-miR-200a, and eca-miR-205 revealed higher expression level in old than young mares with endometritis. This is the first study that has revealed the changes in cell free miRNA and serum inflammatory mediators during endometritis, and these findings could be used for a better understanding the pathophysiology mechanisms of endometritis in equine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34199800</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Review on Ethnoveterinary Practices in Sub-Saharan Africa.</Title>	<Abstract>Background: Livestock represents an important sector for the livelihood of sub-Saharan African countries' inhabitants. In these countries, farmers raise livestock to meet household food demands and as additional sources of incomes, but its production is hampered by rampant animal diseases. The impact of animal diseases is particularly severe for poor communities that, although relying heavily on livestock, have limited access to modern veterinary services and therefore rely on indigenous medicines for the treatment of livestock ailments. Methods: The current review focuses on the ethnoveterinary health management practices found amongst livestock producers in sub-Saharan Africa. Documents were sourced from Google databases. Results: A total of 56 documents were reviewed, most of which were published recently (after 2000). The documents revealed the wide use of ethnoveterinary medicines among livestock producers in sub-Saharan African countries because of their cost and accessibility, threats to ethnomedicinal plant species through improper harvesting methods, overexploitation, the existence of inappropriate ethnoveterinary practices, and methods of conserving ethnomedicinal species. Conclusions: Given the persistent threats posed to ethnoveterinary medicine and/or practices in developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the findings of this review highlight the importance of integrating and promoting the use of ethnoveterinary medicine that is likely to be lost if it is not given enough importance. It is also important to obtain an overview of recent publications on ethnoveterinary medicines to identify the gaps and scope required to be filled by future studies. It is envisaged that the review will stimulate further ethnoveterinary research among livestock disease management practices, which could lead to new pharmaceuticals in the region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effects of different types of lactic acid bacteria (LAB; L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. reuteri, L. brevi, and S. bovis) inoculation (10[6] cfu/ DM) on rice straw silage quality and to determine these effects on ruminal fermentation characteristics, digestibility and microbial populations in an in vitro condition. Inoculated rice straw was ensiled for 15 and 30 days. For the in vitro study, rumen fluid was obtained from three rumen-fistulated bulls fed on mixed forage and concentrate at 60:40 ratio twice daily. Inoculation with LAB improved (p &lt; 0.05) the rice straw silage quality as indicated by higher dry matter and crude protein contents, decreased pH and butyric acid, and increased propionic acid and LAB numbers, especially after 30 days of ensiling. Results from the in vitro study revealed that starting with the addition of LAB to rice straw silage improved in vitro fermentation characteristics such as increased total volatile fatty acids and dry matter digestibility (p &lt; 0.05). LAB treatments also decreased methane production and methane/total gas ratio after 15 and 30 days of ensiling. From the rumen microbial population perspective, cellulolytic, and fungal zoospores were enhanced, while protozoa and methanogens were decreased by the LAB treatments. Based on these results, it could be concluded that inoculating rice straw silage with LAB (especially for L. plantarum and S. bovis) improved silage quality, rumen fermentation parameters and microbial populations in vitro.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-six goats of both the Boer and Speckled were divided into five experimental groups: (T1) = diet + Lactobacillus rhamnosus; (T2) = diet + Enterococcus faecalis; (T3) = diet + Lactobacillus rhamnosus + Enterococcus faecalis; (T4, positive control) = diet + antibiotic and (T5, negative control) = diet without antibiotics and without probiotics. Our results revealed that Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, TM7, Proteobacteria, and Euryarchaeota dominate the bacterial communities. In our observations, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecalis supplements reduced the archaeal population of Methanomassiliicocca in the T1, T2 and T3 groups, and caused an increase in the T4 group. Chlamydiae were present only in the T5 group, suggesting that probiotic and antibiotic inhibit the growth of pathogens in the rumen. We inferred, based on our results, that Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecalis favour the survival of beneficial microbial communities in the goats' rumen. This may lead to an overall improved feed efficacy and growth rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The prebiotics eugenol, chitosan, and naringenin and the probiotic Protexin[&#174;] (Enterococcus faecium) provided in sugar syrup or protein patty either in spring or fall were evaluated for their effects on N. ceranae infection, colony population, honey yield and winter survivorship using field colonies. In the first year, spring treatments with eugenol, naringenin, and Protexin[&#174;] significantly reduced N. ceranae infection and increased honey production, while Protexin[&#174;] also increased adult bee populations and chitosan was ineffective. Fall treatments increased survivorship and decreased N. ceranae infection the following spring. In the second year, selected compounds were further tested with a larger number of colonies per treatment and only protein patty used in the spring and sugar syrup in the fall. Protexin[&#174;] and naringenin significantly decreased N. ceranae infections and increased the population of adult bees after spring treatment, but did not affect honey yields. There were no differences between treatments for colony winter mortality, but surviving colonies that had been treated with Protexin[&#174;] and naringenin were significantly more populated and had lower N. ceranae spore counts than control, non-treated colonies. Protexin[&#174;] and naringenin were the most promising candidates for controlling N. ceranae and promoting honey bee populations, warranting further investigation. Future research should investigate the optimal colony dose and treatment frequency to maximize colony health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

First Report in Horse.</Title>	<Abstract>A five-year-old, entire female Arabian horse with a 6-month history of a non-painful nodule on the conjunctiva of the right eye was evaluated. Ophthalmological examination showed a firm, smooth and fleshy conjunctival mass that raised the suspicion of a conjunctival neoplasm. Histological evaluations showed that the mass was composed of an endophytic growth consisting of numerous long papillary projections of hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium supported by thin fibrovascular stalks. Typical features of squamous cell carcinoma with disorganized cell growth and infiltration of surrounding tissues were detectable within the mass. Inverted papilloma progressing to carcinoma was diagnosed. Follow-up examination showed that no local recurrence was present during the 12-month follow-up period. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing the inverted papilloma in the horse and, due to its progression to squamous cell carcinoma, warns about the inclusion of the inverted papilloma in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival neoplasm and driven treatments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), resulting in constriction of the esophagus. After surgical ligation of the ARSA, CTA showed that the ARSA was not enhanced by contrast medium, and that sufficient collateral circulation of the right forelimb was supplied through the vertebral artery. Furthermore, the right and left vertebral arteries merged into the basilar artery at the level of the atlas, and no abnormal expansion of the ventral spinal artery was observed. Overall, we demonstrated the importance of post-surgical CTA for identification of surgical complications, including the formation of abnormal vessel alterations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34201344</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Design-Based Approach for Analysing Survey Data in Veterinary Research.</Title>	<Abstract>Sample surveys are an essential approach used in veterinary research and investigation. A sample obtained from a well-designed sampling process along with robust data analysis can provide valuable insight into the attributes of the target population. Two approaches, design-based or model-based, can be used as inferential frameworks for analysing survey data. Compared to the model-based approach, the design-based approach is usually more straightforward and directly makes inferences about the finite target population (such as the dairy cows in a herd or dogs in a region) rather than an infinite superpopulation. In this paper, the concept of probability sampling and the design-based approach is briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the estimations and their justifications in the context of several different elementary sampling methods, including simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, and one-stage cluster sampling. Finally, a concrete example of a complex survey design (involving multistage sampling and stratification) is demonstrated, illustrating how finding unbiased estimators and their corresponding variance formulas for a complex survey builds on the techniques used in elementary sampling methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The virus may also be detected in other insect species, including Bombus terrestris adults from wild and managed colonies. In this study, individuals of all stages, castes, and sexes were sampled from three commercial colonies exhibiting the presence of deformed workers and analysed for the presence of DWV. Adults (deformed individuals, gynes, workers, males) had their head exscinded from the rest of the body and the two parts were analysed separately by RT-PCR. Juvenile stages (pupae, larvae, and eggs) were analysed undissected. All individuals tested positive for replicative DWV, but deformed adults showed a higher number of copies compared to asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, they showed viral infection in their heads. Sequence analysis indicated that the obtained DWV amplicons belonged to a strain isolated in the United Kingdom. Further studies are needed to characterize the specific DWV target organs in the bumblebees. The result of this study indicates the evidence of DWV infection in B. terrestris specimens that could cause wing deformities, suggesting a relationship between the deformities and the virus localization in the head. Further studies are needed to define if a specific organ could be a target in symptomatic bumblebees.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of G. duodenalis in Korean native calves and elucidate the causal factors associated with giardiasis in these animals. We investigated the sequences of three genes (ssu, bg, and gdh) of G. duodenalis in fecal samples collected from 792 Korean native calves during 2019-2020. Data were analyzed with regard to age, sex, sampling season, and the fecal sample type (based on its physical characteristics). The samples were screened for the three genes mentioned above, and 44 samples (5.6%) were G. duodenalis-positive. Polymerase chain reaction results showed a significantly higher prevalence of the infection in calves aged &#8805;1 month and in those with watery diarrhea in spring season. Screening for the gene sequences ssu (87.5%), bg (96.2%), and gdh (96.7%) revealed that most of the G. duodenalis-positive samples belonged to assemblage E. Four of the G. duodenalis-positive samples belonged to the zoonotic assemblage A. This study highlights the importance of continuous surveillance of genetic mutations in G. duodenalis for the detection of emerging variants of zoonotic G. duodenalis in calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both the angle of extension and that of flexion were measured in 234 stifle joints of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture. The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation between CCL rupture and alterations in the range of stifle joint motion and to determine whether there was a prevalence modification of one of the two angles. All the extension and flexion angles were obtained from clinical records and were analysed in various combinations. A significant relationship was found between normal angles and abnormal angles; concerning the reduction in the ROM, a significant prevalence in the alteration extension angle was found. Of the 234 stifles, 33 (13.7%) were normal in both angles. These results could offer important insights regarding the influence of CCL rupture on compromising the ROM. This awareness could be a baseline for understanding the ability of surgical treatment to restore one angle rather than another angle, to address the choice of treatment and to help physiotherapists in their rehabilitation program.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The poultry sector has contributed significantly to meet the increased demand for animal source proteins in the country. However, increased use of antimicrobials appeared to be a significant threat to food safety in the poultry sector. The poultry drug and feed sellers are at the frontline position involving selecting and delivering the antimicrobials to the poultry farmers. Studies assessing the poultry drug and feed sellers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) are limited. The current study aimed to assess the community poultry drug and feed sellers' KAPs of antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in some selected areas of Bangladesh. We determined the respondents' (drug and the feed sellers) KAPs of AMU and AMR using a tested and paper-based questionnaire. The study demonstrated that most respondents have insufficient knowledge, less positive attitudes, and inappropriate practices regarding AMU and AMR. The factor score analysis further showed that the type of respondents and their years of experience, level of education, and training on the drug were the significant factors impacting the current knowledge, attitudes, and practices of AMU and AMR. The adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that the drug sellers who completed their education up to 12th grade and had training on the drug had adequate knowledge of AMU and AMR. The data also showed that the drug sellers belong to the age group 31-35 and 36-40 years and who completed 12th grade had good attitudes on the same. Likewise, the analysis further determined that drug sellers belonging to the age category 18-25 and 26-30 years, and interestingly, the respondents who completed education up to 12th grade, had better practices. Spearman's rank-order correlation revealed a positive association between each pair of the KAPs scores for the respondents. The correlation was fair between knowledge-attitudes, knowledge-practices, and attitudes-practices. Based on the current study results, we recommend educational interventions and appropriate training for the poultry drug and feed sellers to raise awareness and to upgrade their current knowledge on the appropriate use of antimicrobials. This will ultimately lead to reducing the chances of developing AMR in the poultry sectors of the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At the presentation, pale oral mucous membranes, rapid and weak femoral pulses, and muffled heart sounds with a moderate left apical systolic murmur were revealed. Echocardiographic examination showed pericardial effusion with organized echogenic material originating from the left atrial wall. Tamponade of the right atrium and severe left atrial enlargement were also observed. Multiple views of the left atrium and left auricle allowed to visualize a hyperechoic mass adherent to the endocardium of the left atrial wall. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography study allowed to rule out active intrapericardial hemorrhages, and echo-guided pericardiocentesis was performed. No recurrence of pericardial effusion was observed, but the dog suddenly died after 10 days. The postmortem examination confirmed multifocal left atrial thrombosis attached to the endomyocardial tears.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dysbiosis of the equine hindgut microbiota can alter the fermentation patterns and cause metabolic disorders. (2) Methods: This study compared the fecal microbiota composition of horses with intestinal disease and their healthy counterparts living in Korea using 16S rRNA sequencing from fecal samples. A total of 52 fecal samples were collected and divided into three groups: horses with large intestinal disease (n = 20), horses with small intestinal disease (n = 8), and healthy horses (n = 24). (3) Results: Horses with intestinal diseases had fewer species and a less diverse bacterial population than healthy horses. Lactic acid bacteria, Lachnospiraceae, and Lactobacillaceae were overgrown in horses with large intestinal colic. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B), which is a relevant marker of gut dysbiosis, was 1.94, 2.37, and 1.74 for horses with large intestinal colic, small intestinal colic, and healthy horses, respectively. (4) Conclusions: The overgrowth of two lactic acid bacteria families, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae, led to a decrease in hindgut pH that interfered with normal fermentation, which might cause large intestinal colic. The overgrowth of Streptococcus also led to a decrease in pH in the hindgut, which suppressed the proliferation of the methanogen and reduced methanogenesis in horses with small intestinal colic.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This requires more insight in the modulatory effects of feed additives on the immune system and microbiota composition. Compounds known to influence the innate immune system and microbiota composition were selected and screened in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo. Among all compounds, 57 enhanced NK cell activation, 56 increased phagocytosis, and 22 increased NO production of the macrophage cell line HD11 in vitro. Based on these results, availability and regulatory status, six compounds were selected for further analysis. None of these compounds showed negative effects on growth, hatchability, and feed conversion in in ovo and in vivo studies. Based on the most interesting numerical results and highest future potential feasibility, two compounds were analyzed further. Administration of glucose oligosaccharide and long-chain glucomannan in vivo both enhanced activation of intraepithelial NK cells and led to increased relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) amongst ileum and ceca microbiota after seven days of supplementation. Positive correlations between NK cell subsets and activation, and relative abundance of LAB suggest the involvement of microbiota in the modulation of the function of intraepithelial NK cells. This study identifies glucose oligosaccharide and long-chain glucomannan supplementation as effective nutritional strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and strengthen the intraepithelial innate immune system.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

White line disease (WLD), also known as shelly hoof, is a prevalent, non-infectious cause of lameness, characterised by the breakdown of the white line. Little is known about the predisposing factors, nor the individual disease dynamics over time. Our exploratory study aimed to investigate the prevalence and temporal dynamics of WLD, and the associated risk factors. Feet of 400 ewes from four UK commercial sheep farms were inspected for WLD at four time points across 12 months. The change in WLD state at foot-level (develop or recover) was calculated for three transition periods. We present WLD to be widespread, affecting 46.8% of foot-level and 76.6% of sheep-level observations. States in WLD changed over time, with feet readily developing and recovering from WLD within the study period. The presence of WLD at foot-level, the number of feet affected at sheep-level and dynamics in development and recovery were driven by a variety of foot-, sheep- and farm-level factors. We provide key insight into the multifaceted aetiology of WLD and corroborate previous studies demonstrating its multifactorial nature. Our study highlights an opportunity to reduce WLD prevalence and informs hypotheses for future prospective studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Lidia bull breed may be considered an athlete, as during a bull fight it displays considerable physical effort of great intensity and short duration in a highly stressful situation. The objective of this study was to assess plasma minerals concentration (macro- and microminerals) in Lidia bulls after intense physical exercise during a bull fight. Plasma Ca, Mg, P, K, Na, Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se and Mo concentrations were measured in 438 male Lidia bulls. Ca, P and Mg were measured using a Cobas Integra autoanalyzer, while Na and K were determined by ICP-AES, and Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se and Mo were measured by ICP-MS. All macrominerals, (Ca: 2.96 &#177; 0.31, Mg: 1.27 &#177; 0.17, P: 3.78 &#177; 0.65, K: 7.50 &#177; 1.58, Na: 150.15 &#177; 19.59 in mmol/L), and Cr (1.24 &#177; 0.58), Ni (0.249 &#177; 1.07), Cu (22.63 &#177; 4.84) and Zn (24.14 &#177; 5.59, in &#956;mol/L) showed greater mean values than the reported reference values in the published literature, while Co (0.041 &#177; 0.07), Se (0.886 &#177; 0.21) and Mo (0.111 &#177; 0.08, in &#956;mol/L) values were lower than those reported for other bovine breeds. These increased concentrations could be justified mainly by muscle cell metabolism, hepatic need to provide energy, and intense dehydration and hemoconcentration by losses through sweat glands or urination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Vaccine development has been impeded by incomplete understanding of protective immunity following natural exposure or the infection and treatment method (ITM) of immunization. This is attributable to a paucity of methods to characterize the memory T-cell repertoire following infection. To overcome this impediment, assays developed to study the immune response to other intracellular pathogens were adapted for use in studies with T. parva to enable definition of the phenotype and function of effector T cells in T. parva-immune cattle, facilitating vaccine development. As reported herein, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ITM-immunized steers with irradiated, autologous, T. parva-infected cell lines elicited a proliferative recall response comprised of CD45R0[+]/CCR7[-] CD4[+] and CD8[+] T cells. Subsequent co-incubation of stimulated cultures with infected cells demonstrated the presence of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) with the ability to kill infected cells. Comparison of CTL activity in cultures depleted of CD4[+] or CD8[+] T cells demonstrated CTL activity was primarily attributed to CD8[+] T cells. Importantly, stimulation of PBMC from vaccinated steers always elicited proliferation of CD4[+] and CD8[+] T cells. This was the first important observation obtained from the use of the assay described herein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eimeria oocysts were divided into seven groups of six replicates that were treated with ozonated water at three ozone concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L) and two contact times (five and ten minutes), and one group (negative control) that was exposed to non-treated water. Giardia cysts were divided into nine groups of six replicates and were treated with ozonated water at four ozone concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mg/L) and two contact times (one and two minutes), while one group (negative control) was exposed to non-treated water. The results of the ozonated water treatment gave a 33% inhibition of the sporulation of Eimeria oocysts and rendered 96.3% of Giardia cysts non-viable, suggesting that ozonated water treatment could be a promising alternative sanitation technology to common conventional disinfectants for reducing intestinal protozoa infections in water buffaloes; though further in vitro and in vivo tests are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The use of medicinal plants with antiviral properties might be useful help to prevent and control PRRSV outbreaks. Caesalpinia sappan (CS) heartwood is an important herbal ingredient used in Thai folk medicine, possessing various biological activities, including antiviral activity. The present study focuses on the in vitro antiviral activity against PRRSV of a semi-purified fraction of ethanolic CS crude extract using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. Qualification of the fractions illustrating positive antiviral activity was carried out with liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The preparative chromatography separated the crude extract into six consecutive fractions, among which the first fraction showed potential antiviral activity by inhibiting PRRSV replication in a MARC-145 monolayer (virus titer 2.75 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL (log10) vs. 9.50 median log10 TCID50/mL of the control) at 72 h post-infection, and this fraction included byakangelicin, brazilin, naringenin, and brazilein. These results provide useful information for further study to effectively develop the CS bioactive antiviral compounds against PRRSV as a feed additive or veterinary drug in the pig industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Given their role, cytokines have been explored as drugs in immunotherapy in the fight against different pathological conditions such as bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, transplantation and cancer. One of the problems related to their administration consists in the definition of the correct dose to avoid severe side effects. In the 70s and 80s different studies demonstrated the efficacy of cytokines in veterinary medicine, but soon the investigations were abandoned in favor of more profitable drugs such as antibiotics. Recently, the World Health Organization has deeply discouraged the use of antibiotics in order to reduce the spread of multi-drug resistant microorganisms. In this respect, the use of cytokines to prevent or ameliorate infectious diseases has been highlighted, and several studies show the potential of their use in therapy and prophylaxis also in the veterinary field. In this review we aim to review the principles of cytokine treatments, mainly IFNs, and to update the experiences encountered in animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

High NEFA inhibit the VLDL synthesis and assembly, and cause hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) deposition. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrial deacetylase, antagonizes NEFA-induced TAG accumulation through modulating expressions of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation genes in cow hepatocytes. However, the role of SIRT3 in the VLDL synthesis and assembly was largely unknown. Here we aimed to test whether SIRT3 would recover the synthesis and assembly of VLDL in cow hepatocytes induced by high NEFA. Primary cow hepatocytes were isolated from 3 Holstein cows. Hepatocytes were infected with SIRT3 overexpression adenovirus (Ad-SIRT3), SIRT3-short interfering (si) RNA, or first infected with Ad-SIRT3 and then incubated with 1.0 mM NEFA (Ad-SIRT3 + NEFA). Expressions of key genes in VLDL synthesis and the VLDL contents in cell culture supernatants were measured. SIRT3 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and ApoE (p &lt; 0.01), and raised VLDL contents in the supernatants (p &lt; 0.01). However, SIRT3 silencing displayed a reverse effect in comparison to SIRT3 overexpression. Compared with NEFA treatment alone, the Ad-SIRT3 + NEFA significantly upregulated the mRNA abundance of MTP, ApoB100 and ApoE (p &lt; 0.01), and increased VLDL contents in the supernatants (p &lt; 0.01). Our data demonstrated that SIRT3 restored the synthesis and assembly of VLDL in cow hepatocytes challenged with NEFA, providing an in vitro basis for further investigations testing its feasibility against hepatic TAG accumulation in dairy cows during the perinatal period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, genetic engineering and transgenesis provide the opportunity for more significant gains and production in a short span of time. One of the best strategies is the genetic alteration of livestock to enhance the efficiency of food production (e.g., meat and milk), animal health, and welfare (animal population and disease). Moreover, genome engineering in the bovine is majorly focused on subjects such as disease resistance (e.g., tuberculosis), eradicate allergens (e.g., beta-lactoglobulin knock-out), products generation (e.g., meat from male and milk from female), male or female birth specifically (animal sexing), the introduction of valuable traits (e.g., stress tolerance and disease resistance) and their wellbeing (e.g., hornlessness). This review addressed the impressive genome engineering method CRISPR, its fundamental principle for generating highly efficient target-specific guide RNA, and the accompanying web-based tools. However, we have covered the remarkable roadmap of the CRISPR method from its conception to its use in cattle. Additionally, we have updated the comprehensive information on CRISPR-based gene editing in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate quantitative and morphological abnormalities of the erythrogram in dogs at different CKD IRIS stages. A total of 482 CBCs from 3648 initially screened were included in the study. Anemia was present in 302/482 (63%) dogs, in the majority of which it was normochromic, normocytic, and non-regenerative (295/302; 98%). The number of reticulocytes was &lt;60,000/&#956;L in the majority of dogs (248/295; 84%), with a correlation between poor regeneration rate and progression of CKD (p = 0.0001). The frequency of anemia significantly differed (p = 0.0001) among the IRIS stages: 108/231 (47%) in IRIS 2, 77/109 (71%) in IRIS 3, and 117/142 (82%) in IRIS 4. Dogs at IRIS stages 3 and 4 were more likely to have moderate to severe anemia, compared to dogs at IRIS stage 2 (p = 0.0001). Anisocytosis was the most frequent morphological abnormality (291/482; 60%), whereas the presence of poikilocytosis showed an association with progression of IRIS stages (p = 0.009). Among different morphological abnormalities, the frequency of fragmented red blood cells and Howell-Jolly bodies showed a significant association with the progression of CKD. Anemia was a frequent finding in CKD dogs, mostly associated with none to poor regeneration rate. Similar to human medicine, advanced CKD stages are more frequently characterized by morphological alterations, such as fragmented red blood cells and Howell-Jolly bodies, which may suggest a more severe condition of reduced bone marrow activity and microangiopathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To gain an insight into the role of immune checkpoints in canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (cDLBCL), we investigated PD-L1, PD-1 and CD8A expression by RNAscope. Results were correlated with several clinico-pathological features, including treatment, Ki67 index and outcome. A total of 33 dogs treated with chemotherapy (n = 12) or chemoimmunotherapy with APAVAC (n = 21) were included. PD-L1 signal was diffusely distributed among neoplastic cells, whereas PD-1 and CD8A were localized in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. However, PD-1 mRNA was also retrieved in tumor cells. An association between PD-L1 and PD-1 scores was identified and a higher risk of relapse and lymphoma-related death was found in dogs treated with chemotherapy alone and dogs with higher PD-L1 and PD-1 scores. The correlation between PD-L1 and PD-1 is in line with the mechanism of immune checkpoints in cancers, where neoplastic cells overexpress PD-L1 that, in turn, binds PD-1 receptors in activated TIL. We also found that Ki67 index was significantly increased in dogs with the highest PD-L1 and PD-1 scores, indirectly suggesting a role in promoting tumor proliferation. Finally, even if the biological consequence of PD-1+ tumor cells is unknown, our findings suggest that PD-1 intrinsic expression in cDLBCL might contribute to tumor growth escaping adaptive immunity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34357916</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Atopic Dermatitis in Domestic Animals: What Our Current Understanding Is and How This Applies to Clinical Practice.</Title>	<Abstract>Atopic dermatitis is a clinical syndrome that affects both people and animals. Dogs closely mimic the complexity of the human skin disease, and much progress has been made in recent years in terms of our understanding of the role of skin impairment and the identification of new treatments. Cats and horses also develop atopic syndromes which include both cutaneous and respiratory signs, yet studies in these species are lagging. It is now recognized that atopic dermatitis is not a single disease but a multifaceted clinical syndrome with different pathways in various subgroups of patients. Appreciating this complexity is clinically relevant as we develop more targeted treatments which may work well in some patients but not in others. Different phenotypes of atopic dermatitis have been described in dogs, and it is possible that phenotypes related to breed and age may exist in other animals similar to how they are described in people. The awareness of different mechanisms of disease leads to the desire to correlate different phenotypes with specific biomarkers and responses to treatment. In this review, the current understanding and updated information on atopic syndrome in animals are described, highlighting opportunities for further studies in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purposes of this retrospective study were to describe ultrasound features of PC in cats and dogs, predisposing factors, comorbidities and outcomes. Cats and dogs with an ultrasonographic diagnosis of PC were included in the study. The bladder ultrasound findings that were recorded were: pseudomembranes' characteristics, abnormalities of the bladder's wall and content and anomalies of the pericystic peritoneal space. Ten cats and four dogs met the inclusion criteria. Four pseudomembrane adhesion patterns were described. The presence of pseudomembrane acoustic shadowing was observed in the 60% of cats. A total of 80% of the cats included were presented for urethral obstruction (UO) and/or had at least one episode of UO in the previous 2 months. Thirteen patients out of fourteen received only medical therapy, and all of them survived. PC is a rare disorder in cats and dogs and there are some ultrasonographic differences between the two species, suggesting a greater severity of the pathology in cats. Chronic cystitis and UO may have a potential role in the development of feline PC. Finally, the medical approach can be a non-invasive and effective approach for PC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Part 1: Claw Length Measurements, Lesion Scores and Their Association.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of the study was to investigate variations in lengths and lesions in claws of culled sows and to evaluate their association. All four feet of 185 sows from three Greek farrow-to-finish farms (Farm A: 57 sows; Farm B: 64 sows; Farm C: 64 sows) were examined for lesions and their lengths were measured. All claw lengths were lower in sows of farm C compared to those from sows of B and A. Claw lengths in sows of farm B were lower compared to those from A for all lateral toes of front feet and for all medial and four out of three lateral toes of rear feet. Sum of length measurements of the main toes of the front feet (SLF) associated with lesions on sole, white line and heel of front feet, while sum of length measurements of the main toes of the rear feet (SLR) associated with all lesions of the rear feet. The lengths of the main toes were correlated with the length of dew claws on front and rear feet. Overall, sows' claw lesion severity and claw lengths may differ between farms and frequency of lesions is higher in longer claws.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the occurrence and frequency of responsible gastro-intestinal (GI) pathogens in severe newborn diarrhea is still not well known. We aimed to determine the seasonal and age-associated pathogen distribution of severe diarrhea in newborn calves admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Erciyes University animal hospital over a year. Fecal samples were collected during the ICU admissions, and specimens were subjected to a diarrheal pathogen screening panel that included bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Cryptosporidium spp., ETEC K99+, and bovine rotavirus, using RT-PCR and conventional PCR methods. Further isolation experiments were performed with permissive cell cultures and bacterial enrichment methods to identify the clinical importance of infectious pathogen shedding in the ICU. Among the hospitalized calves aged less than 45 days old, the majority of calves originated from small farms (85.9%). The pathogen that most frequently occurred was Cryptosporidium spp. (61.5%) followed by rotavirus (56.4%). The frequency of animal admission to ICU and GI pathogen identification was higher during the winter season (44.9%) when compared to other seasons. Most calves included in the study were 1-6 days old (44.9%). Lastly, co-infection with rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. occurred more frequently than other dual or multi-infection events. This study was the first to define severe diarrhea-causing GI pathogens from ICU admitted newborn calves in Turkey.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study investigated whether seven days of oral resveratrol could improve hemodynamic response to hemorrhage and confer benefits on risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) without inducing coagulopathy in a canine model. Twelve greyhound dogs were randomly allocated to receive oral resveratrol (1000 mg/day) or placebo for seven days prior to inducing hemorrhage until a targeted mean blood pressure of &#8804;40 mmHg was achieved. AKI biomarkers and coagulation parameters were measured before, immediately following, and two hours after hemorrhage. Dogs were euthanized, and renal tissues were examined at the end of the experiment. All investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation. A linear mixed model was used to assess effect of resveratrol on AKI biomarkers and coagulation parameters while adjusting for volume of blood loss. A significant larger volume of blood loss was required to achieve the hypotension target in the resveratrol group compared to placebo group (median 64 vs. 55 mL/kg respectively, p = 0.041). Although histological evidence of AKI was evident in all dogs, the renal tubular injury scores were not significantly different between the two groups, neither were the AKI biomarkers. Baseline (pre-hemorrhage) maximum clot firmness on the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM[&#174;]) was stronger in the resveratrol group than the placebo group (median 54 vs. 43 mm respectively, p = 0.009). In summary, seven days of oral resveratrol did not appear to induce increased bleeding risk and could improve greyhound dogs' blood pressure tolerance to severe hemorrhage. Renal protective effect of resveratrol was, however, not observed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans administered orally for 96 h on Apis mellifera workers (newly emerged and nurse bees). &#946;-glucans were included in honey and syrup. Survival rate and phenoloxidase activity were measured. In both newly emerged and nurse bees, &#946;-glucans supplementation did not affect survival rate (p &gt; 0.05). Conversely, phenoloxidase activity was higher in both newly emerged bees (p = 0.048) and nurse bees (p = 0.014) fed with a honey diet enriched with &#946;-glucans compared to those fed with only honey. In both the newly emerged and nurse bees, no statistical differences in phenoloxidase activity were recorded between the group fed with a syrup-based diet enriched with &#946;-glucans and the control group (p &gt; 0.05). The absence of significant variation in survival suggests that the potential negative effect of &#946;-glucans in healthy bees could be mitigated by their metabolism. Conversely, the inclusion of &#946;-glucans in a honey-based diet determined an increase of phenoloxidase activity, suggesting that the effect of &#946;-glucan inclusion in the diet of healthy bees on phenoloxidase activity could be linked to the type of base-diet. Further investigations on &#946;-glucans metabolism in bees, on molecular mechanism of phenoloxidase activation by 1,3-1,6 &#946;-glucans, and relative thresholds are desirable. Moreover, investigation on the combined action of honey and &#946;-glucans on phenoloxidase activity are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We created a questionnaire to evaluate how people perceive the health risk posed by ticks in an area recently invaded by these arthropods, in the western Italian Alps. Moreover, through a collaborative effort with park rangers and physicians, we investigated which tick species bite humans and their infection with pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and spotted-fever group Rickettsiae). Apart from two Dermacentor marginatus bites, we identified Ixodes ricinus (n = 124) as the main species responsible for tick bites. The investigated pathogens infected 25.4% of tested I. ricinus. The evaluation of the engorgement rate of biting I. ricinus revealed that they had been likely feeding on humans for 24 h or more, suggesting a high probability of pathogen transmission. Indeed, the questionnaires revealed that people infrequently adopt preventive measures, such as inspecting the body for ticks, although most respondents claimed that ticks are a threat to human health. Having suffered from previous tick bites was positively associated with the adoption of personal protection measures. Given the increasing incidence of tick-borne diseases in the region, the public should be better informed about the possibility of being bitten by infected ticks in order to mitigate the risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34357924</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Benefit-Risk Assessment of the French Surveillance Protocol of Apparently Healthy Biting Dogs and Cats for Human Rabies Prevention.</Title>	<Abstract>In France, apparently healthy dogs and cats that bite humans must undergo an observation period of 15 days with three veterinary visits to ascertain that they remain healthy, indicating that no zoonotic transmission of rabies virus occurred via salivary presymptomatic excretion. This surveillance protocol is mandatory for all pets that have bitten humans, despite France's rabies-free status in non-flying mammals (i.e., a very low rabies risk). In this context, we aimed to perform a benefit-risk assessment of the existing regulatory surveillance protocol of apparently healthy biting animals, as well as alternative surveillance protocols. A scenario-tree modelling approach was used to consider the possible successions of events between a dog or cat bite and a human death attributed to either rabies or to lethal harm associated with the surveillance protocol (e.g., lethal traffic accidents when traveling to veterinary clinics or anti-rabies centers). The results demonstrated that the current French surveillance protocol was not beneficial, as more deaths were generated (traffic accidents) than avoided (by prompt post-exposure prophylaxis administration). We showed here that less stringent risk-based surveillance could prove more appropriate in a French context. The results in this study could allow policy-makers to update and optimize rabies management legislation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease usually presents as localized purulent dermatitis, crusty hair masses or widespread matting of the hair. This condition is most common in domestic ruminants; but it can also affect other wild animals and humans. Antimicrobial therapy is used in many regions to treat clinical dermatophilosis with varying results. In this study, we aimed to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility of D. congolensis isolates. Fifty-two isolates were obtained from animals showing clinical signs of the disease at farms in St. Kitts. The isolates were then confirmed as D. congolensis by phenotypic tests, PCR and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry. Furthermore, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 16 antimicrobial agents were determined, using the broth microdilution method. Although most antimicrobials showed MICs in line with published values, the tetracycline results displayed a clear bimodal distribution over the tested range, with most isolates showing low MICs and 6 isolates much higher values (+/- 100-fold increase). These results indicate the presence of acquired tetracycline resistance in D. congolensis on the island of St. Kitts. Whether the current observation has implications for efficacy of treating the disease must be confirmed in further research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

H9N2 cocirculation with other highly pathogenic aIAVs has the potential to contribute to the rise of new strains with pandemic potential. Therefore, rapid detection of H9 aIAVs infection is crucial to control virus spread. A qualitative reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of aIAV subtype H9N2 was developed. All results were compared to the gold standard (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). The RT-RPA assay was designed to detect the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9N2 by testing three pairs of primers and a probe. A serial concentration between 10[6] and 10[0] EID50 (50% embryo infective dose)/mL was applied to calculate the analytical sensitivity. The H9 RT-RPA assay was highly sensitive as the lowest concentration point of a standard range at one EID50/mL was detected after 5 to 8 min. The H9N2 RT-RPA assay was highly specific as nucleic acid extracted from H9 negative samples and from other avian pathogens were not cross detected. The diagnostic sensitivity when testing clinical samples was 100% for RT-RPA and RT-PCR. In conclusion, H9N2 RT-RPA is a rapid sensitive and specific assay that easily operable in a portable device for field diagnosis of aIAV H9N2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there is currently no statistical analysis identifying the least affected breeds. To this end, 2912 canine amputated digits submitted from 2014-2019 to the Laboklin GmbH &amp; Co. KG for routine diagnostics were statistically analyzed. The study population consisted of 155 different breeds (most common: 634 Mongrels, 411 Schnauzers, 197 Labrador Retrievers, 93 Golden Retrievers). Non-neoplastic processes were present in 1246 (43%), tumor-like lesions in 138 (5%), and neoplasms in 1528 cases (52%). Benign tumors (n = 335) were characterized by 217 subungual keratoacanthomas, 36 histiocytomas, 35 plasmacytomas, 16 papillomas, 12 melanocytomas, 9 sebaceous gland tumors, 6 lipomas, and 4 bone tumors. Malignant neoplasms (n = 1193) included 758 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 196 malignant melanomas (MM), 76 soft tissue sarcomas, 52 mast cell tumors, 37 non-specified sarcomas, 29 anaplastic neoplasms, 24 carcinomas, 20 bone tumors, and 1 histiocytic sarcoma. Predisposed breeds for SCC included the Schnauzer (log OR = 2.61), Briard (log OR = 1.78), Rottweiler (log OR = 1.54), Poodle (log OR = 1.40), and Dachshund (log OR = 1.30). Jack Russell Terriers (log OR = -2.95) were significantly less affected by SCC than Mongrels. Acral MM were significantly more frequent in Rottweilers (log OR = 1.88) and Labrador Retrievers (log OR = 1.09). In contrast, Dachshunds (log OR = -2.17), Jack Russell Terriers (log OR = -1.88), and Rhodesian Ridgebacks (log OR = -1.88) were rarely affected. This contrasted with the well-known predisposition of Dachshunds and Rhodesian Ridgebacks to oral and cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms. Further studies are needed to explain the underlying reasons for breed predisposition or "resistance" to the development of specific acral tumors and/or other sites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Camel brucellosis has been reported in almost all camel-rearing countries in Africa and Asia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2020 and February 2021 in Galkayo, Garowe, and Bosaso districts in the Puntland State of Somalia to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors of brucellosis in camels. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) was used to detect anti-Brucella antibodies, while a structured questionnaire was used to collect epidemiological data. A total of 441 camel sera were screened against Brucella antibodies. Thirty-one (7%; 95% CI: 4.8-9.8%) samples were positive, and thirteen (54.2%; 95% CI: 32.8-74.4%) out of the twenty-four farms sampled had at least one seropositive animal. Galkayo district had the highest number of Brucella-seropositive camels (10.3%), followed by Bosaso district (8.6%), while Garowe district had the lowest number of seropositive camels (1.4%). The binary logistic regression model revealed that camels in Galkayo district (p = 0.015; OR: 9.428; 95% CI: 1.539-57.755), camels from large herd sizes of &gt;50 animals (p = 0.019; OR: 5.822; 95% CI: 1.336-25.371), and those in contact with small ruminants (p = 0.011; OR: 10.941; 95% CI: 1.728-69.285) were significantly associated with seropositive cases of camel brucellosis in the Puntland State of Somalia. The present study shows that Brucella infections in camels are prevalent in the three districts covered by the study. This poses a public health risk, because milk from these camels is used for human consumption. Studies focusing on the isolation of Brucella strains in camels and investigating brucellosis in ruminants and humans are recommended in the study area. Validation of serological tests-including c-ELISA-for Brucella antibody detection in camels is also needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Rumen digesta samples from 16 bulls were subjected for microbial profiling. Distinctive microbial profiles were revealed by the two methods, indicating that choice of sequencing approach may be a critical facet in studies of the rumen microbiome. Shotgun-sequencing identified the presence of 303 bacterial genera and 171 archaeal species, several of which exhibited differential abundance. Amplicon-sequencing identified 48 bacterial genera, 4 archaeal species, and 9 protozoal species. Among them, 20 bacterial genera and 5 protozoal species were differentially abundant between the two diets. Overall, amplicon-sequencing showed a more drastic diet-derived effect on the ruminal microbial profile compared to shotgun-sequencing. While both methods detected dietary differences at various taxonomic levels, few consistent patterns were evident. Opposite results were seen for the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and the genus Selenomonas. This study showcases the importance of sequencing platform choice and suggests a need for integrative methods that allow robust comparisons of microbial data drawn from various omic approaches, allowing for comprehensive comparisons across studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Indeed, some cardiac abnormalities may be corrected with surgery, and very often, treatment needs to be performed early before congestive heart failure or irreversible heart damage can occur. From a legal viewpoint, if the defect is revealed in a newly purchased puppy, the buyer may be required to return it and receive compensation. Puppies affected with congenital heart defects are likely to die prematurely, causing emotional suffering to the owner. Furthermore, by considering breed predisposition, early recognition allows breeders to avoid breeding from particular dogs with genetic defects and prevent the continuation of genetic defects in breeding lines. Given gaps in the literature about the recognition of murmurs in the puppy trade, the present article describes how to identify a heart murmur in a puppy during a pre-purchase examination and its significance from a clinical and legal viewpoint. In the canine population, the prevalence of cardiac defects ranges between 0.13 and 1.6%. Pulmonic stenosis is the most common defect found in puppies, followed by patent ductus arteriosus, subaortic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. On the basis of the above considerations, the veterinarian should recognize and identify the murmur following a protocol for routine examination of puppies involved in trade.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate how Italian owners of epileptic dogs receiving long-term treatment perceived their own quality of life (QoL) and that of their pet, using a list of key questions. A questionnaire was sent to owners of dogs affected by recurrent seizures and treated with antiepileptic drugs for at least three months. The questions included signalment, medical history and physical, social and psychological aspects associated with managing an epileptic dog. Eighty complete questionnaires were obtained. Most owners surveyed had a positive opinion on their dog's QoL and they did not believe that commitment to managing their animals was a limitation of QoL. Dog QoL, seizure, frequency and severity were considered the most important factors in evaluating the efficacy of the antiepileptic treatment. The evaluation of the different aspects of QoL can help veterinary professionals understand the need for correct and exhaustive information provided to owners and the development of therapeutic plans and follow up, corresponding to the needs of dogs and owners.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Five healthy Standardbred cross colts were premedicated with IV acepromazine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg), medetomidine (7 &#181;g/kg) and methadone (0.1 mg/kg) and anaesthesia induced with IV ketamine (2.2 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.06 mg/kg). Horses were anaesthetised for 40 min with an IV infusion of ketamine (3 mg/kg/h), medetomidine (5 &#181;g/kg/h) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg/h) while routine surgical castration was performed. Cardiorespiratory variables, arterial blood gases, and anaesthetic depth were assessed at 5 to 10 min intervals. Post-anaesthesia recovery times were recorded, and the quality of the recovery period was assessed. The anaesthetic period and surgical conditions were acceptable with good muscle relaxation and no additional anaesthetic required. The median (range) time from cessation of the infusion to endotracheal tube extubation, head lift and sternal recumbency were 17.2 (7-35) min, 25 (18.9-53) min and 28.1 (23-54) min, respectively. The quality of anaesthetic recovery was good, with horses standing 31.9 (28-61) min after the infusion was ceased. During anaesthesia, physiological variables, presented as a range of median values for each time point were: heart rate 37-44 beats/min, mean arterial pressure 107-119 mmHg, respiratory rate 6-13 breaths/min, arterial partial pressure of oxygen 88-126 mmHg, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide 52-57 mmHg and pH 7.36-7.39. In conclusion, the co-administration of midazolam, ketamine and medetomidine as in IV infusion, when used as part of a balanced anaesthetic technique, was suitable for short term anaesthesia in horses undergoing castration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study compares the characteristics of chloramphenicol-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolated from the bulk tank milk of four major dairy companies in Korea. Although the distribution of multidrug resistance patterns showed no significant differences between the four companies, 85 chloramphenicol-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolates showed a significantly high number of resistances against five or six antimicrobial classes (37.6%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). When analyzing the distribution of phenicol resistance genes, 31 (36.5%) isolates only carried the catA gene, and two (6.3%) isolates from company A only carried the cfr gene. No isolates carried the catB or fexA genes. Regarding the distribution of other resistance genes, both the tetL and tetM (45.9%), ermB (82.4%), and both aac(6&#8243;)-Ie-aph(2&#8243;)-la and ant(6')-Ia genes (30.6%) showed a high prevalence, and the optrA and poxtA genes were observed separately, each in only two (2.4%) isolates. Our results confirm that the dissemination of chloramphenicol-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and some antimicrobial resistance genes show significant differences between dairy companies. Therefore, our results support that each dairy company should undertake effective surveillance programs to better understand and minimize the emergence of resistance on a multidisciplinary level.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this literature review is to provide a critical evaluation of the scientific reports on SILS in the field of small animal laparoscopic surgery. A comprehensive literature review was performed including from 1 January 2009 to 1 July 2020. The following data were recorded from each study: the design, year of publication, surgical procedure, species, number of animals included, and surgical time. The type of SILS technique and type of control group technique were evaluated. In total, 90 articles were identified through database searches and manual searches. The qualitative analysis showed that most of the articles were retrospective studies, without a control group or case series. A meta-analysis was performed on the eight controlled studies, showing that SILS ovariectomy and gastrointestinal procedures had a comparable surgical time to multiport techniques. The study of the articles available in the veterinary literature did not allow for an adequate meta-analysis of the published results, especially regarding post-operative pain, evaluations of surgical times, and post-operative complications in comparison to multiport techniques. Therefore, veterinary surgeons who want to employ these techniques must consider the real advantages of SILS techniques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite effective and routinely adopted, hatchery spray vaccination has been hypothesized to affect chicks' body temperature and wellbeing. Recently, gel administration has been proposed as an alternative and proved feasible in experimental settings. In this study, IBV spray and gel vaccination methods were compared in field conditions. One hundred birds from the same hatch were enrolled in the study and vaccinated, half by spray and half by gel, with 793B and Mass vaccines. After vaccination, rectal temperature was measured and vaccine intake assessed. The two groups were housed for 35 days in separate pens and swabs and blood samples were collected at multiple time points for genotype-specific molecular analyses and serology, respectively. The temperature was significantly lower in spray-vaccinated chicks 10 min and an hour after administration. A similar trend in 793B titres was observed in both groups, while the Mass vaccine was detected later but persisted longer in gel-vaccinated chicks. No differences were observed in mean antibody titres. Compared to spray, gel administration appears equally effective and less impactful on body temperature, thus supporting its application for IBV vaccination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At necropsy, the cause of death was attributed to a total of 76 helminth parasites found in the trachea and lungs, then identified as Cyathostoma bronchialis. The flock was initially treated by feed with flubendazole (1200 g/1000 kg/feed) for 7 consecutive days but, at the reappearance of the respiratory symptoms 10 days after, the animals were given fenbendazole by drinking water (300 mg/L) for 7 consecutive days, but at the reappearance of the respiratory symptoms 10 days after, the animals were given fenbendazole via drinking water (300 mg/L) for 7 consecutive days. Despite these treatments, the respiratory symptoms continued to relapse 10-15 days after the end of drug administration. In the literature, there are no data regarding drugs for the treatment of C. bronchialis infestations in geese, and the use of these drugs in exotic birds occurs as "off-label" use. This case study provides information on C. bronchialis life cycle, which is still poorly studied and poorly documented today. In particular, the case provides useful suggestions for evaluating an appropriate protocol for the treatment of C. bronchialis in geese.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Scattered information exists regarding the serum biochemical or urinary profiles associated with the administration of IVIC in dogs. The aim of the study was to describe, compare, and discuss from the perspective of previous studies the alterations in serum biochemical and urinary parameters before (T0) and within one week (T1) of the IVIC administration during routine computed tomography (CT) scan evaluation of 22 dogs. Mature dogs presenting for CT scan evaluation for preoperative oncology staging/surgical planning were included. T1 evaluation was performed within one week of IVIC administration. Statistically significant differences in serum total protein, albumin, chloride, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations, urine protein to creatinine ratio, and urine specific gravity were found between T1 and T0. At T1, the serum creatinine concentration was within reference ranges in all dogs but one. An increase in the urine protein to creatinine ratio was observed in four samples, one of which was non-proteinuric at T0. Changes in biochemistry and urine parameters between T0 and T1 were not considered clinically significant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34437470</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Efficiency Comparison of a Novel E2 Subunit Vaccine and a Classic C-Strain Vaccine against Classical Swine Fever.</Title>	<Abstract>Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the most important viral diseases in swine, causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. In China, CSF is one of the key diseases that needs to be controlled; the government has implemented control measures, and vaccination with C-strain vaccines (C-vacs) has been compulsory since the 1950s. C-vacs do not allow the differentiation of field virus-infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). In 2012, China proposed a goal of eradicating CSF. Additionally, a baculovirus-expressed E2 subunit vaccine (E2-vac) was licensed in 2018. However, the C-vac and E2-vac characteristics have not been compared. Here, we demonstrate that both the C-vac and E2-vac provide complete protection against CSF in pigs. The E2-vac allows DIVA, and the E2 antibody responses of stimulated pigs are developed earlier and are stronger than the C-vac antibody responses. Therefore, the E2-vac is a new candidate licensed vaccine to completely eradicate CSF on pig farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34437471</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Natural Products against Sand Fly Vectors of Leishmaniosis: A Systematic Review.</Title>	<Abstract>Leishmaniosis is a vector-borne disease transmitted to animals and humans by the bite of blood-sucking phlebotomine sand flies. These small insects play a crucial role in the diffusion of the disease. To date, the sole strategy recognized for the prevention of leishmaniosis is the use of topical repellent compounds against sand fly bites. Several synthetic insecticides and repellents have been developed; however, the wide and unprejudiced use of these formulations have led to the loss of their effectiveness and the development of resistance phenomena. Moreover, some of these synthetic repellents have severe detrimental effects on the environment and could represent a serious threat to both animal and human health. Recently, an increased interest in the research on alternative approaches to sand fly control has been expressed. In this study, we systematically reviewed the efforts of the scientific community to individuate a phytochemical alternative for the control of sand fly species recognized as vectors of Leishmania spp. Based on literature research using different electronic databases, a total of 527 potentially relevant studies were screened and narrowed down to a final 14 eligible scientific reports. Our analysis suggests that although there is a rapidly growing body of literature dedicated to botanical insecticides and repellents against sand fly vectors of Leishmania spp., much of this literature is limited to in vitro studies conducted in laboratory conditions, and only a few of them investigated the repellency of plant-based products. These studies highlighted that natural compounds display a really short period of action and this significantly limits the use of these products as an alternative to chemical-based repellents.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among the different methods of processing, soaking represents a simple and inexpensive alternative. This study attempted to determine the nutritional properties of socked Jatropha curcas kernel (JCK) and the effect of its dietary inclusions on Clarias gariepinus (n = 50; mean initial weight = 6.19 &#177; 0.52 g). Three treatments of JCK (i.e., soaking 24, 48, and 72 h) were tested alongside a control group. The result showed that soaking substantially improved proximate composition and reduced anti-nutrient compared to the control JCK. A similar trend of improved performance was observed when the treated JCK was included in diets composed of 35% crude protein; a total of 315 kcal g[-1] energy and fed to C. gariepinus for 56 days. Alongside the improvement observed in growth, it was also noted that carcass protein and haematological variables were improved with the dietary administration of soaked JCK. Histological examination of the intestine and liver tissues also revealed fewer signs of histopathological degeneration in the fish, consequent upon dietary inclusion of soaked JCK (i.e., 72 h) compared to those raised on the raw JCK-included diets. It was, therefore, concluded that soaking could be a much easier method of nutritionally improving JCK for the administration to C. gariepinus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The economic impact of CLA in Switzerland remains largely unknown, and the transmission modalities, as well as the genetic diversity of circulating strains, are poorly understood. This work presents further characterization data for 215 C. pseudotuberculosis isolates from sheep, goats and a dromedary originating from Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein, collected over a 15-year period. The isolates were classified into the two biovars Ovis and Equi, analyzed for the presence of the diphtheria-like toxin gene and characterized using MLSA. All sheep and goat isolates were classified as C. pseudotuberculosis biovar Ovis. The isolate from a dromedary was classified as biovar Equi. No isolates harboring the diphtheria-like toxin gene were detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequences of four genes revealed the existence of 24 clusters. There was no correlation between MLSA sequence types, year of isolation and the geographical origin of the isolates. These findings confirm the presence of several MLSA sequence types in the study area and over a 15-year period. Moreover, no sheep- and goat-specific MLSA sequence types were found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34437474</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Research Progress on the Mechanism of the Acupuncture Regulating Neuro-Endocrine-Immune Network System.</Title>	<Abstract>As one of the conventional treatment methods, acupuncture is an indispensable component of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Currently, acupuncture has been partly accepted throughout the world, but the mechanism of acupuncture is still unclear. Since the theory of the neuro-endocrine-immune network was put forward, new insights have been brought into the understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture. Studies have proven that acupuncture is a mechanical stimulus that can activate local cell functions and neuroreceptors. It also regulates the release of related biomolecules (peptide hormones, lipid hormones, neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, and other small and large biomolecules) in the microenvironment, where they can affect each other and further activate the neuroendocrine-immune network to achieve holistic regulation. Recently, growing efforts have been made in the research on the mechanism of acupuncture. Some researchers have transitioned from studying the mechanism of acupuncture as a single linear pathway to using systems approaches, including metabolomics, genomics, proteomics and biological pathway analysis. This review summarizes the research progress on the neuro-endocrine-immune network related mechanism of acupuncture and discusses its current challenges and future directions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ace-1-Dkk-1, a canine prostate cancer (PCa) cell line overexpressing Dkk-1, was used to investigate Wnt signaling pathways in PCa tumor growth. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, was used to examine whether it would decrease tumor growth and bone tumor phenotype in canine PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Ace-1-Vector[YFP-Luc] and Ace-1-Dkk-1[YFP-Luc] cells were transplanted subcutaneously, while Ace-1-Dkk-1[YFP-Luc] was transplanted intratibially into nude mice. The effects of Dkk-1 and SP600125 on cell proliferation, in vivo tumor growth, and bone tumor phenotype were investigated. The mRNA expression levels of Wnt/JNK-related genes were measured using RT-qPCR. Dkk-1 significantly increased the mRNA expression of Wnt/JNK-signaling-related genes. SP600125 significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation genes and downregulated osteoclastic-bone-lysis-related genes in vitro. SP600125 significantly decreased tumor volume and induced spindle-shaped tumor cells in vivo. Mice bearing intratibial tumors had increased radiographic density of the intramedullary new bone, large foci of osteolysis, and increased cortical lysis with abundant periosteal new bone formation. Finally, SP600125 has the potential to serve as an alternative adjuvant therapy in some early-stage PCa patients, especially those with high Dkk-1 expression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this report, a 13-year-old captive white African lioness (Panthera leo), with a recent history of intermittent bouts of lethargy and inappetence, presented with a distended abdomen (due to ascites) and a small, round crusty lesion on the ear. An abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of masses on the liver and an exploratory laparotomy revealed multiple pale lesions on the liver and omentum. Histopathology revealed sheets of pleomorphic neoplastic cells compressing the non-neoplastic liver tissue. Similar neoplastic cells had multifocally expanded and effaced omentum adipose tissue, as well as formed a well-circumscribed mass in the ear sample, extending from close to the epidermis to the lateral and deep margins of the section. All three tissue samples had a high mitotic index (15 per 10 HPF), and critically, in the ear sample, there were rafts of neoplastic cells in the lymphatics, indicating lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemistry for the melanoma marker, PNL-2, showed strong positivity in all three tissue samples. Thus, the diagnosis was of malignant melanoma with metastasis to the liver and omentum. This is the first report of metastatic cutaneous melanoma in a lion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to describe signalment and clinical data of cats with EPI. Determination of TLI was performed using an in-house ELISA; the reference interval was defined using a Reference Limit Estimator. Groups were formed from 4813 cats (2019-2020), based on their fTLI concentration: 1 (&lt;8 &#181;g/L; decreased; n = 275), 2 (8-88 &#181;g/L; reference interval; n = 4256), and 3 (&gt;88 &#181;g/L; increased; n = 282). Males and Domestic Shorthairs were most common in all groups. Group 3 had the highest (13 years), and group 1 had the lowest (9 years), median age. Clinical information was available for 200 cats (decreased fTLI: n = 87, lower reference interval (8-12 &#181;g/L): n = 113). Treatment response was observed in 83% (decreased fTLI) and 66% (lower reference interval). EPI cats displayed weight loss (69%), diarrhoea (68%), vomiting (41%), anorexia (39%), poor hair coat (35%), lethargy (33%), and/or polyphagia (21%). The lower the serum fTLI concentration, the more often good treatment response was reported (p = 0.022) but there were no statistically significant clinical signs. In conclusion, fTLI is a helpful parameter to diagnose EPI but predicting treatment response based on signalment or clinical signs is not possible.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

With no approved antiviral or vaccine interventions for MERS, vaccines are being developed for camels to prevent virus transmission into humans. We have previously developed a chimpanzee adenoviral vector-based vaccine for MERS-CoV (ChAdOx1 MERS) and reported its strong humoral immunogenicity in dromedary camels. Here, we looked back at total RNA isolated from whole blood of three immunised dromedaries pre and post-vaccination during the first day; and performed RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in order to shed light on the molecular immune responses following a ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination. Our finding shows that a number of transcripts were differentially regulated as an effect of the vaccination, including genes that are involved in innate and adaptive immunity, such as type I and II interferon responses. The camel Bcl-3 and Bcl-6 transcripts were significantly upregulated, indicating a strong activation of Tfh cell, B cell, and NF-&#954;B pathways. In conclusion, this study gives an overall view of the first changes in the immune transcriptome of dromedaries after vaccination; it supports the potency of ChAdOx1 MERS as a potential camel vaccine to block transmission and prevent new human cases and outbreaks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The concentration of some coagulation proteins can be affected by the processing steps used for the preparation of leuko-reduced plasma units. In this study, we assessed the effect of leukoreduction on coagulation activity of canine plasma collected for transfusion. Ten plasma units, five obtained from non-leuko-reduced (non-LR) whole blood (WB) units and five from leuko-reduced (LR) WB units were evaluated. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), coagulation factor activities of factors (F) V, VIII, X, XI, and von Willebrand (vWF), fibrinogen and D-dimers content were assessed at collection (baseline value, D0) and after 7 days of frozen storage at -18 &#176;C (D7). Compared to non-LR plasma units, LR units showed a statistically significant prolonged aPTT and reduced FXI activity. Filtration had no significant effect on the other factors and parameters evaluated. Filtration-dependent changes appear to have no impact on the therapeutic quality of plasma obtained from leuko-reduced whole blood, other than for FXI activity. Further studies on a larger sample size comparing the same unit before and after leukoreduction are needed to confirm these findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The effects of AD on cardiorespiratory parameters in ruminants has not yet been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiac and respiratory changes that resulted from an intravenous AD infusion in goats. Six clinically healthy adult goats weighing 28 &#177; 2 kg were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a crossover design with a seven day washout period. The goats received a 0.9 % saline solution (SAL treatment) and three AD treatments (AD 50, 100 and 200) intravenously at a dose rate of 50, 100 and 200 &#956;g/kg/min. Cardiorespiratory and key cardiac parameters were measured before the treatment (baseline), during the infusion (dInf) and at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after each infusion was discontinued. The AD 100 produced a significant increase in HR (p = 0.001) and the AD 200 resulted in significant rises in HR (p = 0.006) and RR (p = 0.001) compared with the baseline. This study concluded that the AD infusion could trigger an increase in HR and RR in a dose-dependent manner in healthy goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The current research aimed to test the use of MF in routine diagnosis of coccidia and helminth infections in several domestic and exotic bird collections in Portugal. Between July 2020 and April 2021, a total of 142 fecal samples from organic layers, peacocks and ratites were collected in four Portuguese bird collections and processed using MF and fecal cultures to identify and calculate GI parasite shedding and prevalence. The McMaster method was also used to compare the shedding levels obtained for both quantitative techniques. MF's relative sensitivity and specificity were also assessed, using McMaster as the reference technique. The implementation of MF resulted in an average Eimeria spp. shedding higher in peacocks from bird collection 2 (502 OPG), followed by peacocks from collection 1 (107 OPG) and organic layers (24 OPG) and peacocks from collection 3 (9 OPG). Peacocks were also positive for Capillaria spp., Trichostrongylus tenuis and Strongyloides&amp;nbsp;pavonis, whereas ostriches and emus were infected by L. douglassii. The MF protocol for exotic animals and the McMaster method did not differ significantly for each parasitic agent and bird species, and MF achieved relative sensitivities and specificities higher than 70% for Galliform Eimeria spp., peacock helminths and ratites' L. douglassii infections. Higher L. douglassii EPG values were identified using the MF protocol for exotic species (2 g of feces/38 mL of sucrose solution), followed by McMaster 2/28, MF 5/45 and MF 2/18. The use of MF allowed for obtaining different intestinal parasitic populations in several bird species and locations, and MF 2/38 is globally proposed as the most suitable protocol for bird fecal samples as an alternative to the McMaster method in the diagnosis of avian intestinal parasitic infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pericardiectomy can be a definitive treatment in the case of idiopathic pericardial effusion or a short-term intervention for mesothelioma. The aim of the present study was to investigate which histopathologic parameters are correlated with clinical outcomes in a cohort of dogs that underwent pericardiectomy. The histopathological findings of 22 IPs and 5 PMs were compared with clinical and survival data and the immunohistochemical characterization of immune cells (CD3, CD79&#945;, Iba1). In IP, the mesothelium was lost in 20 cases, reactive in 9, atypical in 3, and mesothelial papillary hyperplasia (MPH) was observed in 4 cases. Numerous macrophages were found in both IPs and PMs especially at the superficial layer of the pericardium. T lymphocytes were observed in mild to moderate numbers and were more numerous than B lymphocytes in both IPs and PMs. MPH was correlated with the quantity of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the superficial layer, inversely related to the thickness of the pericardium, and associated with a longer overall survival. Pericardial fibrosis was present in 19 out of 22 IPs and in all mesotheliomas and was correlated with increased time from initial presentation and pericardiectomy and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the deep zone. Pericardial thickness was correlated with the amount of lymphoplasmacytic and macrophagic infiltrate in the deep zone. Mesothelioma was associated with an increased number of pericardiocentesis procedures before pericardiectomy and with the presence of macrophages in the superficial pericardial layer, edema, fibrin, and hemorrhage. Disease-free interval and overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with mesothelioma compared with IP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34437485</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Report on the First African Swine Fever Case in Greece.</Title>	<Abstract>African swine fever (ASF) poses a major threat to swine health and welfare worldwide. After several European countries have reported cases of ASF, Greece confirmed officially the first positive case on 5 February 2020. The owner of a backyard farm in Nikoklia, a village in Serres regional unit, Central Macedonia, reported a loss of appetite, weakness, dyspnea, and the sudden death of 6 domestic pigs. Necropsy was performed in one gilt and findings were compatible with acute to subacute septicemic disease. Predominantly, hyperemic enlargement of spleen and lymph node enlargement and/or hemorrhage were observed. Description of vague clinical signs by the farmer suggested a limited resemblance to ASF-acute infection. However, the disease could not be ruled out once septicemic condition including splenomegaly, was diagnosed macroscopically at necropsy. In addition, considering the farm's location near to ASF protection zones, a further diagnostic investigation followed. Confirmation of the disease was obtained using a series of diagnostic tests on several tissue samples. Further clinical, molecular, and epidemiologic evaluation of the farm was performed. According to the contingency plan, authorities euthanized all 31 pigs on the farm, whilst blood testing revealed ASF virus infection. Further emergency measures were implemented to contain the spread of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To better understand the correlation between size and body mass, and biochemical parameters of capybaras from areas with different degrees of anthropization (i.e., different food supplies), we sampled free-ranging capybaras from areas of natural landscapes (NLs) and human-modified landscapes (HMLs) in Brazil. Analyses of biometrical and biochemical parameters of capybaras showed that animals from HMLs were heavier (higher body mass) than those from NL, a condition possibly related to fat deposit rather than body length, as indicated by Body Condition Index (BCI) analyses. Biochemical parameters indicated higher serum levels of albumin, creatine kinase, cholesterol, fructosamine and total protein among capybaras from HMLs than from NLs; however, when all adult capybaras were analyzed together only cholesterol and triglycerides were positively correlated with body mass. We propose that the biochemical profile differences between HMLs and NLs are related to the obesity condition of capybaras among HMLs. Considering that heavier animals might live longer and reproduce more often, our results could have important implications in the population dynamics of capybaras among HMLs, where this rodent species is frequently represented by overgrowth populations that generate several levels of conflicts with human beings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty-four dogs suffering from primary chronic enteropathies were assessed on the first visit with a veterinary gastroenterologist and on the first follow-up visit using a 1-10 visual scale to evaluate five features of QoL, the Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index, the Lexington Attachment to Pet Scale, and the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire. They were compared to a control group of 49 healthy dogs and to a group of 50 dogs suffering from cancer. QoL and severity of enteropathy were negatively associated; enteropathic dogs on the first visit had a lower QoL than healthy dogs for all features and a lower general QoL than cancer patients; enteropathic dogs on the follow-up visit improved significantly for general QoL, health QoL, and interaction QoL. Higher levels of attachment between the owner and the dog were obtained for dogs affected by chronic enteropathies. Finally, dogs showed higher scores for separation-related behaviors and contact/attention behaviors on the first visit than on the subsequent follow-up. As in human medicine, chronic enteropathies have a strong negative impact on dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For centuries, Helix aspersa Muller mucus has been known to have biological properties that are useful for treating skin disorders. In this study, we used a full-thickness excisional wound model in mice to test the hypothesis that Snail Secretion Filtrate (SSF) can improve the wound healing process. The mucus from Helix aspersa Muller was obtained mechanically by manually stimulating snails with a sterile cotton swab tip, and then the mucus was subjected to a series of filtrations to obtain SSF. After wounding, the mice were treated topically with SSF for 14 days. Our macroscopic results show that the SSF treatment significantly improved the speed and percentage of wound area closure. Furthermore, SSF improved several markers of proper wound healing, such as collagen deposition (Masson, COL3A1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) and the tissue remodeling process (&#945;-sma, vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). SSF was also able to counteract the inflammatory process in injured wound tissue (myeloperoxidase (MPO) IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TNF-&#945;). In conclusion, our results show that SSF is able to enhance the speed and efficiency of wound healing and positively regulate several aspects of the wound healing process, such as the proliferative and remodeling phases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our previous study revealed that magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (nMH) have potency in improving the bioavailability of fixed-combined TM in rodent models. This study aimed to investigate whether the fixed combination with nMH improves the ocular hypotensive effect of TM and affects pupil size (PS), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in clinically healthy dogs. Five clinically healthy dogs were administered topical saline, commercial 0.5% TM, and a 0.01% or 0.1% nMH-0.5% TM fixed combination (0.01% or 0.1% nMH-TM) twice daily in one eye for 7 days with at least a 28-day interval. The changes from baseline were calculated and were statistically analyzed for each drug. IOP was significantly reduced in both 0.01% and 0.1% nMH-TM-treated-dogs compared with saline- and TM-treated dogs. Meanwhile, 0.01% and 0.1% nMH did not exacerbate the side effects of TM. From these results, nMH improved the ocular hypotensive effect of TM without enhancing side effects. Topical nMH-TM is potentially more effective for canine ocular hypotensive eye drops than TM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We also classified the main sperm defects found in semen. Semen samples were collected from mature peregrine falcons via cloacal massage and stained with Diff-Quik stain. The percentages of normal, abnormal, and immature sperm cells were determined by bright-field optical microscopy. The number of normal spermatozoa were greater at the initial stage and subsequently decreased during the middle and later stages of the reproductive season (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa increased significantly in the middle and end stages of the reproductive season (p &lt; 0.05), whereas the proportion of immature spermatozoa remained stable during the study. Head defects represented the greatest proportion of morphological abnormalities, followed by the defects in the tail and midpiece regions. A small percentage of multiple defects and cytoplasmic droplets were also observed in the falcon spermatozoa. The findings of this study might be important for the development of future conservation protocols for falcon sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Typical symptoms of enteric infections include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps or pain, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever and weight loss. Evaluation of new control methods against enteric infections requires the use of many animals. We aimed to develop a new method for an initial in vivo screen of promising compounds against neonatal diseases such as cryptosporidiosis while limiting experimental animal use. We therefore adapted an in vivo method of multiple consecutive but independent intestinal loops to newborn lambs delivered by cesarean section, in which endotoxin responsiveness is retained. This new method allowed for the screening of natural yeast fractions for their ability to stimulate immune responses and to limit early Cryptosporidium parvum development. This model may also be used to investigate host-pathogen interactions and immune responses in a neonatal controlled environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Most of these pathogens have a relevant impact on human and livestock health which may cause severe disease and economic loss. In the present study, the fecal samples collected from 121 wild birds belonging to 15 species of the genera Anas, Tadorna, Fulica, Arddea, Larus, Falco, Athene, Accipiter, and Columba were submitted to bacteriological and molecular analyses to detect Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and microsporidia. Four (3.3%) animals were positive for one pathogen: one Anas penelope for C. burnetii, one Larus michahellis for S. enterica serovar Coeln, and two Columba livia for Encephalitozoon hellem. Although the prevalence rates found in the present survey were quite low, the obtained results confirm that wild birds would be the a potential fecal source of bacterial and parasitic zoonotic pathogens which sometimes can also represent a severe threat for farm animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of L-PRP in the treatment of canine aural hematomas associated with otitis externa. Twenty mL of citrated whole blood was collected from each of the 17 dogs included and autologous L-PRP was produced. The aural hematoma was drained and 0.5-1 mL of L-PRP was injected. The dogs were examined weekly until 7 days after complete clinical healing. A final clinical follow-up was performed 6 weeks after the first treatment with L-PRP. If there was recurrence of the aural hematoma at the first follow-up, the treatment was repeated. In total, 2/17 cases were lost after the first follow-up. In 5/17 dogs, a short-term recurrence occurred. In 12/15 cases, complete clinical resolution was achieved with a single L-PRP application (Group A1) and in 3/15 with two treatments (Group A2). The mean time to complete clinical resolution was 16 &#177; 8.7 days (A1) and 23.3 &#177; 4 days (A2), respectively. No side effects were reported.

This zoonotic disease is caused by infection of protozoa Leishmania spp. and the most serious mucocutaneous and visceral form is produced by Leishmania infantum, which predominates in the Mediterranean region. The usual hosts for this parasite are dogs and humans, but an increment in cases of L. infantum infection has been observed in cats in the last years. This increase could be due to the use of sandflies repellents in dogs, obligating the parasite to looking for other hosts. The role of cats in the epidemiology of this disease is unknown, although increase of prevalence of feline leishmaniosis has been observed in endemic areas in the last years. Diagnostic techniques and treatments in cats are not standardized, which makes it difficult to establish prevalence and epidemiology of feline leishmaniosis. Furthermore, the clinical signs and immune response against Leishmania in cats are different to those in dogs, with an observed increment of drug resistance. It is necessary to increase our knowledge about L. infantum infection in cats, including clinical signs, transmission, treatments, and the role of cats in the increasing of zoonoses. Finally, new alternative treatments are required for controlling the spread of this disease in all species of mammals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 3 replicates of 4 lambs each. The diet was composed of total mixed ration (TMR) without SFH (control group), and the TMR diet supplemented with SFH at a level of 5% (SFH5), 10% (SFH10) and 15% (SFH15). Lambs in the treatment groups had greater BW changes (p = 0.04) and ADG (p = 0.04) than the lambs in the control group. Intake of dry matter, acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in SFH15 compared to SFH10. Digestibility of ADL and empty stomach weight were also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in SFH10 and SFH15, respectively. Cooking loss, blood total cholesterol and total protein decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in SFH15. Ruminal lightness (L) and yellowness (b) also increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in SFH15. We concluded that the TMR diet supplemented with up to 15% SFH improved weight gain, digestibility, meat cooking loss and rumen color in Awassi lambs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Part 2: Mechanical Indices of Hoof Horn and Their Associations with Length Measurements and Lesion Scores.</Title>	<Abstract>The objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanical indices of hoof horn and their association with length measurements and lesion score. The feet of 185 culled sows from three Greek farms (A: 57 sows; B: 64 sows; C: 64 sows) were used. A slice from the dorsal wall of each claw was used to assess by a three-point bending test the Young's modulus, yield stress and aximum stress values. The available data from a companion study (part 1) on the length measurements and lesion scores of the claws were used to reveal possible relationships. The Young's modulus values were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001 or p &lt; 0.01 depending on location of claw) in the sows of farm C compared to those in sows of farms A and B and in sows of farm B compared to those in the sows of farm A. Yield and maximum stress values were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05 or p &lt; 0.001 depending on the location of the claw) in the sows of farm C compared to those in the sows of farm A and in the sows of farm B compared to those in the sows of farm A. An increase in heel-sole length decreased all mechanical indices. Young's modulus and yield stress were associated with wall lesion severity while maximum stress with wall and heel lesion severity. Overall, we conclude that mechanical efficiency deteriorates as length and lesion score increases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Damaged, misshapen or overgrown feet have the potential to cause lameness either directly, or indirectly. There is a lack of understanding of the predisposing factors for different hoof conformation traits in sheep. Our exploratory study aimed to investigate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, three distinct hoof conformation traits relating to the sole and heel, hoof wall, and hoof wall overgrowth. Feet of 400 ewes from four UK commercial sheep farms were inspected at four time points across 12 months. For each conformation trait, a four-point ordinal system was used to score each individual claw, and foot-level scores were calculated. We present 92.4% of foot-level observations to be affected by &#8805;1 conformation traits. Whilst hoof conformation traits were correlated to some degree, a unique set of sheep-, foot- and farm-level factors were associated with each distinct conformation trait. We provide, for the first time, key insight into the multifaceted and multifactorial aetiology of hoof conformation in sheep, building upon previous landmark studies. Our results inform hypotheses for future prospective studies investigating the risk factors for adverse hoof conformation in sheep.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have become a tool of choice that can be used to treat these resistant bacteria. Several studies have shown that AgNPs have antibacterial and wound healing properties. In this study, we evaluated the biological activity of anisotropic AgNPs to develop an antimicrobial gel formulation for treating wound infections. We showed that some anisotropic AgNPs (S2) have an effective antibacterial activity against bacterial pathogens and low cytotoxicity to keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. The MIC and MBC values were in the range of 2-32 &#181;g/mL, and cytotoxicity had IC50 values of 68.20 &#177; 9.71 &#181;g/mL and 68.65 &#177; 10.97 &#181;g/mL against human keratinocyte and normal human dermal fibroblast cells, respectively. The anisotropic AgNPs (S2) were used as a gel component and tested for antibacterial activity, including long-term protection, compared with povidone iodine, a common antiseptic agent. The results show that the anisotropic AgNPs can inhibit the growth of most tested bacterial pathogens and provide protection longer than 48 h, whereas povidone iodine only inhibits the growth of some bacteria. This study suggests that anisotropic AgNPs could be used as an alternative antimicrobial agent for treating bacterial skin infection and as a wound healing formulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In contrast to incidental hosts which present with an array of clinical manifestations, reservoir hosts are typically asymptomatic and can shed leptospires from chronically infected kidneys via urine for extended periods of time. Renal excretion of leptospires occurs despite evidence of a humoral and cellular immune response and is reflective of the unique biological equilibrium that exists between certain animal species and specific serovars of Leptospira. Here, we demonstrate that urinary excretion of leptospires is accompanied by the presence of antigen-specific urinary immunoglobulin. In rats experimentally infected with L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni using the intraperitoneal or conjunctival route of inoculation, urinary immunoglobulin (Ig) G specific for protein antigens was detectable within 1 week. Rat urinary IgG was not bound to urinary-derived leptospires. In cattle that were naturally exposed to, and infected with, L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo, urinary IgA specific for protein antigens was detected. Collectively, these results demonstrate that urinary excretion of immunoglobulin specific for leptospires is a hallmark of reservoir hosts of infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The meal contained about 60% protein with a good balance of essential amino acids, containing various bioactive compounds, including saponins, phytic acids, trypsin inhibitors, lectins, phenolics, and flavonoids, which render it as a potential biofeed for animal production. The Jatropha meal demonstrated various biological activities, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects which enhance its property as a bio-feed. The levels of these bioactive compounds in the seeds are dependent on the genotypes. The J. curcas possessed different varieties which are either toxic or non-toxic according to the presence of phorbol esters. The presence of phorbol esters in the meal confirmed the toxic variety of Jatropha resulting in the limited application of meal as a biofeed. The Jatropha meal devoid of phorbol esters could be applied as a biofeed in the animal production industry, and for the toxic varieties, various techniques such as physicochemical and biological treatments have been introduced to the industry to remove the phorbol esters from Jatropha meal. Several studies employing various cells and animals confirmed the toxicity of the phorbol esters. The molecular mechanism of action of phorbol esters is through up-regulation of PKC-&#946; II gene, overexpression of down-stream proto-oncogenes resulted in inflammation and oxidative stress ending by apoptotic cell death. Despite the presence of valuable bioactive compounds in the Jatropha meal, its nutritional application is not recommended unless the phorbol esters are completely removed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Studies on SLA polymorphism have demonstrated associations between SLA allelic variants, immune response, and disease resistance. The SLA polymorphism is due to host-pathogen co-evolution resulting in improved adaptation to diverse environments making SLA a crucial genomic region for comparative diversity studies. Although locally-adapted African pigs have small body sizes, they possess increased resilience under harsh environmental conditions and robust immune systems with reported tolerance to some diseases, including African swine fever. However, data on the SLA diversity in these pigs are not available. We characterized the SLA of unrelated locally-adapted domestic pigs from Homa Bay, Kenya, alongside exotic pigs and warthogs. We undertook SLA comparative diversity of the functionally expressed SLA class I (SLA-1, SLA-2) and II (DQB1) repertoires in these three suids using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sequence-based typing (SBT) method. Our data revealed higher genetic diversity in the locally-adapted pigs and warthogs compared to the exotic pigs. The nucleotide substitution rates were higher in the peptide-binding regions of the SLA-1, SLA-2, and DQB1 loci, indicative of adaptive evolution. We obtained high allele frequencies in the three SLA loci, including some breed-specific private alleles, which could guide breeders to increase their frequency through selection if confirmed to be associated with enhanced resilience. Our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on genetic diversity in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment, availing the first DQB1 gene data from locally-adapted Kenyan pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Medicinal herbs and plants do not have very much in vitro antagonism and in vivo disease resistance towards lactococcosis agents in aquaculture. Most in vitro studies with herbal extractives were performed against L. garvieae with no strong antibacterial activity, but essential oils, especially those that contain thymol or carvacrol, are more effective. The differences exhibited by the bacteriostatic and bactericidal functions for a specific extractive in different studies could be due to different bacterial strains or parts of chemotypes of the same plant. Despite essential oils being shown to have the best anti-L. garvieae activity in in vitro assays, the in vivo bioassays required further study. The extracts tested under in vivo conditions presented moderate efficacy, causing a decrease in mortality in infected animals, probably because they improved immune parameters before challenging tests. This review addressed the efficacy of medicinal herbs to lactococcosis and discussed the presented gaps.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In particular, exosomes are formed inside cells via multivesicular bodies (MVBs), thus their protein, DNA, and RNA content are similar to those of the parent cells. Exosome research is rapidly expanding, with an increase in the number of related publications observed in recent years; therefore, the function and application of MSC-derived exosomes could emerge as cell-free therapeutics. Exosomes have been isolated from feline AD-MSCs and feline fibroblast cell culture media using ultracentrifugation. Feline exosomes have been characterized by FACS, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy imaging. Moreover, cytokine levels were detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in exosomes and LPS-induced THP-1 macrophages. The size of the isolated exosomes was that of a typical exosome, i.e., approximately 150 nm, and they expressed tetraspanins CD9 and CD81. The anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was increased in feline AD-MSC-derived exosomes. However, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1&#946;, IL-8, IL-2, RANTES, and IFN-gamma were significantly decreased in feline AD-MSC-derived exosomes. This was the first demonstration that feline AD-MSC-derived exosomes enhance the inflammatory suppressive effects and have potential for the treatment of immune diseases or as an inflammation-inhibition therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The scientific interest is focused on isolating and characterizing these cells. The aims of the present study were to verify a novel VICs mechanical isolation method and to characterize isolated cells using immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence, with parallel histological and immunohistochemistry assays on bovine and canine healthy and MMVD mitral valves. Antibodies against vimentin (VIM), smooth muscle actin (SMA), von Willebrand (vW) factor, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) &#946;1, and Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) were used. The isolation method was considered reliable and able to isolate only VICs. The different assays demonstrated a different expression of SMA in healthy and MMVD mitral valves, and TRPV1 was isolated for the first time from bovine and canine VICs and the correspondent mitral valve leaflets. The novelties of the present study are the new isolation method, that may allow correlations between laboratory and clinical conditions, and the identification of TRPV1, which will lead to further investigations to understand its function and possible role in the etiology of MMVD and to the design of new therapeutic strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating properties of CBD for the first time directly in canine inflammatory response. We used an ex vivo model of LPS-stimulated whole dog blood. We stimulated the whole blood from healthy dogs with LPS 100 ng/mL for 24 h in the presence or not of CBD 50 and 100 &#956;g/mL. We observed a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-&#945; production from the group treated with CBD, but non-altered IL-10 levels. Moreover, we also observed from the CBD-treated group a reduction in Nf-&#954;B and COX-2 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating properties of CBD directly in dogs' immune cells, using a canine ex vivo inflammatory model.

Among the 599 female dogs, 306 were intact (51%), 50 (8%) had been spayed before 2 years of age (ES, early spaying), and 243 (41%) after 2 years (LS, late spaying). During their lifetime, 79 dogs (13.2%) developed pyometra, and 160 (26.7%) a mammary tumor. Among the 293 dogs with complete follow-up, 103 (35.1%) had at least one MT during their lifetime, of which 53 (51.5%) died of their mammary cancer. Spayed (ES + LS) female dogs had a 4-fold decreased risk of dying from mammary cancer (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.47, p &lt; 0.0001) compared to intact females. In this low-sterilization rate population, MTs developed in 35.1% of female dogs over their lifetime and was the cause of death in half of them.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CrCL plays a fundamental role in the stability and biomechanics of the femoral-tibio-patellar joint, and its incorrect functionality severely impacts on the quality of life of patients. In dogs, the structural weakening of this joint due to the progressive degeneration of the ligament is the most accredited etiopathogenetic hypothesis in relation to the dog signalment (breed, sex and age) and the stifle joint conformation. In humans, this injury is often traumatic and generally occurs during sporting activities. CrCL rupture can be managed conservatively or surgically, and decisions regarding treatment are due to numerous factors: the patient's age and health, the degree of stifle instability, and cost. Physiotherapy protocols play an important role in rehabilitation, with similar goals in humans and dogs: pain management, physiological articular range of motion recovery, periarticular and core muscle strengthening, and proprioceptive deficit correction. Physiotherapy, even if often neglected in veterinary medicine, is mandatory for the recovery of the correct functionality of the injured limb and for the return to normal daily and sporting activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The dietary treatments had no significant effects on the pattern of intestinal microbiota or production traits. The digestive tract bacteriota composition was affected mostly by the sampling place and age of birds. The dominant family of IC was Lactobacillaceae, without change with the age. The abundance of the two other major families, Enterococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae decreased with the age of birds. In the IM, Clostridiaceae was the main family in the first three weeks. Its ratio decreased later and Lactobacillaceae became the dominant family. In the CC, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were the main families with decreasing tendency in the age. In IC, Br treatment decreased the abundance of genus Lactobacillus, and both Br and Sy increased the ratio of Enterococcus at day 7. In all gut segments, a negative correlation was found between the IBD antibody titer levels and the ratio of genus Leuconostoc in the first three weeks, and a positive correlation was found in the case of Bifidobacterium, Rombutsia, and Turicibacter between day 21 and 40.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a major constraint to the livestock industry worldwide, including in Latin America. The aim of this study was to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens in cattle from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where no detailed epidemiological data are available. Blood samples were collected from 104 cattle. Apicomplexan parasites were detected by nested PCR amplification of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA), and Anaplasmataceae was screened by the PCR amplification of 16S rDNA, followed by characterisation based on the heat shock protein and citrate synthase gene sequences. Babesia infection was observed in nine cattle (one Babesia bovis and eight Babesia bigemina), while Anaplasmataceae infection was detected in thirty-two cattle. A sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma platys-like. These results provide the first molecular evidence for the four above-mentioned tick-borne pathogens in cattle in Bolivia. This information improves our understanding of the epidemiology of TBDs and will help in formulating appropriate and improved pathogen control strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34564583</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Imipramine Accelerates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Renal Impairment, Diabetic Retinopathy, Insulin Resistance, and Urinary Chromium Loss in Obese Mice.</Title>	<Abstract>Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been approved for treating depression and anxiety in patients and animals and that has relatively mild side effects. However, the mechanisms of imipramine-associated disruption to metabolism and negative hepatic, renal, and retinal effects are not well defined. In this study, we evaluated C57BL6/J mice subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) to study imipramine's influences on obesity, fatty liver scores, glucose homeostasis, hepatic damage, distribution of chromium, and retinal/renal impairments. Obese mice receiving imipramine treatment had higher body, epididymal fat pad, and liver weights; higher serum triglyceride, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, renal antioxidant enzyme, and hepatic triglyceride levels; higher daily food efficiency; and higher expression levels of a marker of fatty acid regulation in the liver compared with the controls also fed an HFD. Furthermore, the obese mice that received imipramine treatment exhibited insulin resistance, worse glucose intolerance, decreased glucose transporter 4 expression and Akt phosphorylation levels, and increased chromium loss through urine. In addition, the treatment group exhibited considerably greater liver damage and higher fatty liver scores, paralleling the increases in patatin-like phospholipid domain containing protein 3 and the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and fatty acid-binding protein 4. Retinal injury worsened in imipramine-treated mice; decreases in retinal cell layer organization and retinal thickness and increases in nuclear factor &#954;B and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels were observed. We conclude that administration of imipramine may result in the exacerbation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, and kidney injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Experiment 1, mares (n = 12) received estradiol for 3 days (E2-3d), and then 24 h after the last injection, an IPRD was inserted and kept in place for 9 days. Three days after IPRD removal, mares were treated with E2-3d, and then a new IPRD was inserted and maintained for three days. Serum progesterone concentrations were assessed 2, 6, and 12 h after insertion and removal of IPRD, and then daily from the insertion of the first IPRD to one day after removal of the second IPRD. Experiment 2 was conducted with embryo recipient mares randomly assigned to four groups: (1) Cyclic: mares (n = 75) had ovulation confirmed after receiving a single dose of histrelin when a periovulatory follicle was first detected, (2) LAP4: acyclic mares (n = 92) were treated with E2-3d and then administered a single dose of LAP4 24 h after the last estradiol injection, (3) IPRD: acyclic mares (n = 130) were treated with E2-3d and an IPRD for 4-8 days, and (4) RE-IPRD: acyclic mares (n = 32) were synchronized as in the IPRD group but not used for embryo transfer (ET), then 8 to 15 days later, the mares were resynchronized with E2-3d and an IPRD for 4-8 days. In vivo-produced Day-8 embryos were collected and transferred 4-8 days after ovulation or progesterone treatments. Mares in IPRD and RE-IPRD groups had the intravaginal device removed immediately before ET, and then a new IPRD was inserted right after ET. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at 5, 30, and 60 days after ET. Once pregnancy was confirmed, mares in the three acyclic groups received weekly injections of LAP4 (1.5 g) until 120 days of pregnancy. Mares in IPRD and RE-IPRD groups had the device removed three days after the first pregnancy diagnosis. In Experiment 1, progesterone concentrations increased rapidly starting 2 h after insertion of IPRD (p &lt; 0.05); then, concentrations plateaued well above pregnancy maintenance until removal on days 9 and 3, respectively. Progesterone concentrations were reduced to baseline 24 h after IPRD removal (p &lt; 0.05). For experiment 2, there was no difference in pregnancy rates across groups (65-74%) or pregnancy losses by 60 days of gestation (7-12%) (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the IPRD used herein resulted in a rapid increase and a sharp decline in progesterone concentrations upon its insertion and removal, respectively. Finally, our results demonstrated that IPRD could be a compatible alternative to LAP4 to synchronize and resynchronize acyclic embryo recipient mares.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34564585</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Detection and Characterization of Blastocystis sp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in Cattle in Northern Spain.</Title>	<Abstract>Some enteric parasites causing zoonotic diseases in livestock have been poorly studied or even neglected. This is the case in stramenopile Blastocystis sp. and the microsporidia Enterocytozoon bieneusi in Spain. This transversal molecular epidemiological survey aims to estimate the prevalence and molecular diversity of Blastocystis sp. and E. bieneusi in cattle faecal samples (n = 336) in the province of &#193;lava, Northern Spain. Initial detection of Blastocystis and E. bieneusi was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing of the small subunit (ssu) rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, respectively. Intra-host Blastocystis subtype diversity was further investigated by next generation amplicon sequencing (NGS) of the ssu rRNA gene in those samples that tested positive by conventional PCR. Amplicons compatible with Blastocystis sp. and E. bieneusi were observed in 32.1% (108/336, 95% CI: 27.2-37.4%) and 0.6% (2/336, 95% CI: 0.0-1.4%) of the cattle faecal samples examined, respectively. Sanger sequencing produced ambiguous/unreadable sequence data for most of the Blastocystis isolates sequenced. NGS allowed the identification of 10 Blastocystis subtypes including ST1, ST3, ST5, ST10, ST14, ST21, ST23, ST24, ST25, and ST26. All Blastocystis-positive isolates involved mixed infections of 2-8 STs in a total of 31 different combinations. The two E. bieneusi sequences were confirmed as potentially zoonotic genotype BEB4. Our data demonstrate that Blastocystis mixed subtype infections are extremely frequent in cattle in the study area. NGS was particularly suited to discern underrepresented subtypes or mixed subtype infections that were undetectable or unreadable by Sanger sequencing. The presence of zoonotic Blastocystis ST1, ST3, and ST5, and E. bieneusi BEB4 suggest cross-species transmission and a potential risk of human infection/colonization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Because of the progressive nature of DM, many dogs are elected to be euthanized, resulting in limited information on the end-stage clinical presentation. We investigated the long-term clinical course from diagnosis to natural death to further deepen our understanding of the entire clinical picture of this disease. Because curcumin was administered in some cases, the therapeutic effect of curcumin on DM was also examined. Forty dogs included in this study were client-owned Pembroke Welsh Corgis with a definitive diagnosis of DM by necropsy and histopathology. Dogs were excluded from this study if they died from another disease or were elected to be euthanized. Information on the long-term clinical symptoms of DM was investigated based on a questionnaire, which was collected from the dog owners. Urinary incontinence and respiratory disorder were observed in most dogs, as was respiratory impairment-correlated death. In contrast, signs consistent with brainstem dysfunction were noticed at the terminal stage in a small portion of dogs. Although further studies with more cases are needed, the results of this study suggest that administration of curcumin is effective in slowing the progression of DM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The foal was referred to the hospital with clinical signs of severe abdominal distension of a few hours duration. Because analgesics did not relieve pain, the foal remained uncomfortable, and distension of the abdomen increased; an exploratory laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. The final diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively. During exploration of the abdominal cavity, other problems like right dorsal displacement and torsion of the colon were recognized. Correction of all problems was completed, and the mesentery was sutured. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. The foal was recovering well a few months after surgery, and the owner did not complain about the results of the treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Choosing the correct model to use is a crucial step in animal research. The aim of this study was to report the differences between ectopic and orthotopic xenografts in tumor progression, metastasis capacity, histological features, and steroid hormone profiles in xenografts from the cIMC (canine inflammatory mammary cancer) cell line IPC-366 and hIBC (human inflammatory breast cancer) cell line SUM149. To achieve this purpose, 40 female mice 6-8 weeks old were inoculated with IPC-366 and SUM149 cells subcutaneously (ectopic models) or into mammary fat pad (orthotopic models). Mice were monitored for tumor progression and appearance of metastases, and generated tumors were analyzed in terms of histological examination and steroid hormone production. The results revealed differences in tumor appearance and percentage of metastasis between ectopic and orthotopic models, which were higher in the ectopic xenografts from both cell lines. However, both models had similar characteristics of tumor progression, histological features, and steroid hormone secretion profiles. We show that the ectopic model can be validated as a good and useful model of tumor development in addition to, not contrary to, the orthotopic model in breast cancer research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes related to 1185 cattle abortion cases in Latvia during 2013-2018. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes among cattle abortions was 16.1% (191/1185). The seasonality of L. monocytogenes abortions was observed with significantly higher occurrence (p &lt; 0.01) in spring (March-May). In 61.0% of the cases, the affected cattle were under four years of age. L. monocytogenes abortions were observed during the third (64.6%) and second (33.3%) trimesters of gestation. Overall, 27 different sequence types (ST) were detected, and four of them, ST29 (clonal complex, CC29), ST37 (CC37), ST451 (CC11) and ST7 (CC7), covered more than half of the L. monocytogenes isolates. Key virulence factors like the prfA-dependent virulence cluster and inlA, inlB were observed in all the analyzed isolates, but lntA, inlF, inlJ, vip were associated with individual sequence types. Our results confirmed that L. monocytogenes is the most important causative agent of cattle abortions in Latvia and more than 20 different STs were observed in L. monocytogenes abortions in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34564590</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serological Evidence of Human Infection with Coxiella burnetii after Occupational Exposure to Aborting Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Cattle are broadly deemed a source of Coxiella burnetii; however, evidence reinforcing their role in human infection is scarce. Most published human Q fever outbreaks relate to exposure to small ruminants, notably goats. Anti-phase II C. burnetii IgG and IgM were measured by indirect fluorescent antibody tests in 27 farm and veterinary diagnostic laboratory workers to ascertain whether occupational exposure to cattle aborting due to C. burnetii was the probable source of exposure. Four serological profiles were identified on the basis of anti-phase II IgG and IgM titres. Profile 1, characterised by high IgM levels and concurrent, lower IgG titres (3/27; 11.1%); Profile 2, with both isotypes with IgG titres higher than IgM (2/27; 7.4%); Profile 3 with only IgG phase II (5/27; 18.5%); and Profile 4, in which neither IgM nor IgG were detected (17/27; 63.0%). Profiles 1 and 2 are suggestive of recent C. burnetii exposure, most likely 2.5-4.5 months before testing and, hence, during the window of exposure to the bovine abortions. Profile 3 suggested C. burnetii exposure that most likely predated the window of exposure to aborting cattle, while Profile 4 represented seronegative individuals and, hence, likely uninfected. This study formally linked human Q fever to exposure to C. burnetii infected cattle as a specific occupational hazard for farm and laboratory workers handling bovine aborted material.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(2019), which has shown positive effects of various antibacterial agents in combination with the antihistamine mepyramine (MEP). Therefore, pigs were treated in three different settings: An untreated control group, 10 mg/kg florfenicol (FFC) and 10 mg/kg FFC in combination with 20 mg/kg MEP. E. coli were isolated from faecal samples and analyzed in growth quantity and resistance to FFC. The FFC medication induced an increased number of resistant E. coli strains isolated from faecal samples. The number of colonies detected after cultivation of animal samples treated with 10 mg/kg FFC was higher than the number of colonies after treatment with 10 mg/kg FFC in combination with of FFC and MEP. Furthermore, the effect of both compounds was examined on bacterial susceptibility of Pasteurella multocida in vitro, where the combination of FFC with MEP resulted in a diminished minimum inhibitory concentration. We confirmed the development of bacterial resistance in the intestine as non-target tissue caused by the use of the antibacterial agent florfenicol. Moreover, the combination of FFC with an antihistamine like MEP offers a possibility to enhance the efficacy of an antibacterial treatment and modifies the effect on gut microbiota.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Accumulating evidence has linked oxidative stress with the progression of bone diseases. The present study aimed to identify the effects of FLL on oxidative stress-related osteoporosis in vivo and in vitro. To construct animal models, we utilized d-galactose (D-gal) injection to induce oxidative stress combined with a low calcium (the exact percentage in the diet was 0.1%) diet. Thirteen-week-old Kunming female mice were gavaged with water extract of FLL for 20 days. Then, eight-month-old Kunming female mice were treated with FLL under standard administration and diet as the aged group. In vitro, MC3T3-E1 cells stimulated by H2O2 were treated with FLL for 24 h. The micro-CT results showed that the modeling approach combining oxidative stress with a low calcium diet caused low conversion type osteoporosis in mice. FLL exerted a prominent effect on preventing osteoporosis by inhibiting oxidative stress, increasing bone mineral density (BMD), improving bone microstructure, and promoting osteoblast proliferation and osteoprotegerin (OPG) protein expression; however, FLL had no therapeutic effect on bone loss in aged mice. In conclusion, FLL showed outstanding anti-bone loss ability both in vivo and in vitro and could probably be developed as a prophylactic agent for osteoporosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Little is known, however, about the efficacy of chiropractic treatment as precautionary measure, aiming to reduce the probability of spondylosis development. We performed a randomized study where one half of the Boxer puppies from 17 litters were given veterinary chiropractic treatment at monthly intervals from eight weeks of age until they were one year old, while the other half were given no treatment (treated: n = 44, controls: n = 43). At an age of one year, spondylosis occurrence was recorded based on a scoring of X-ray images of the spine. The frequency of occurrence was significantly lower (p = 0.0478) in the treated dogs (25.0%) than in the controls (46.5%). We also tested if spondylosis occurrence in the treated dogs correlated with the average number of spinal joints with decreased mobility found per chiropractic treatment. No such effect was found, however. In summary, our results suggest that veterinary chiropractic treatment may be successfully used to reduce the probability of early development of spondylosis in young Boxers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we aimed to test if the LPS-converted PrP[res] is infectious and alters the expression of genes related to prion pathology in brains of terminally sick mice. Ninety female FVB/N mice at 5 weeks of age were randomly assigned to 6 groups treated subcutaneously (sc) for 6 weeks either with: (1) Saline (CTR); (2) LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (LPS), (3) one-time sc administration of de novo generated mouse recombinant prion protein (moPrP; 29-232) rich in beta-sheet by incubation with LPS (moPrP[res]), (4) LPS plus one-time sc injection of moPrP[res], (5) one-time sc injection of brain homogenate from Rocky Mountain Lab (RLM) scrapie strain, and (6) LPS plus one-time sc injection of RML. Results showed that all treatments altered the expression of various genes related to prion disease and neuroinflammation starting at 11 weeks post-infection and more profoundly at the terminal stage. In conclusion, sc administration of de novo generated moPrPres, LPS, and a combination of moPrP[res] with LPS were able to alter the expression of multiple genes typical of prion pathology and inflammation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34679031</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Fetal Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Hydramnios in a Quarter Horse Mare.</Title>	<Abstract>Hydramnios is an excessive accumulation of fluid within the amniotic compartment. It is a rare condition in mares, often associated with fetal anomalies. Hydrops of fetal membranes predisposes to the rupture of the prepubic tendon, and many authors suggest the induction of parturition to preserve mare's reproductive career. This report presents the case of a 15-year-old multiparous Quarter Horse mare, referred at 268 days of gestation for suspected hydrops. Repeated ultrasonographic exams confirmed an increase in the depth of the amniotic fluid and reduced fetal viability. During the hospitalization, the mare developed a partial rupture of the prepubic tendon. In this case, a conservative approach was elected, and the mare was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and an abdominal support bandage. At 327 days of gestation, the mare gave birth to a foal with APGAR score 1. The resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, and the foal died immediately. A post-mortem examination diagnosed a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) with pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic eventration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to identify the muscle belly that provided the highest percentage of successful StO2 readings and the highest mean StO2 value. Fifty adult horses were enrolled in a prospective controlled study. StO2 was measured at six different muscles in each horse, for each intervention: hair overlying the muscle was clipped (post clipping: PC), clipped skin was cleaned with chlorhexidine (post-surgical prepping: PP) and medetomidine was administered intravenously (post medetomidine: PM). Mean StO2 values were calculated for each muscle, and a linear effects model was used to assess the effect of muscle group and intervention on StO2. The sartorius muscle gave the highest percentage of successful StO2 values (p &lt; 0.001) and the highest mean (90% CI) StO2 values for the PC, PP and PM interventions. Surgical prepping of the skin increased the success for measurement of StO2 values. For all muscles, administration of medetomidine was associated with lower StO2 values (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, of the muscles examined, the sartorius muscle may be the preferred muscle to measure StO2 in horses, and clipping and cleaning of the probe placement site is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dog breeds with mutations of the MDR1-gene are known to show adverse reactions to certain drugs, yet metabolic imbalance exacerbated by physiologically immature organs and other contributing pathologies require consideration before arriving at a diagnosis. This study analysed the brains of two male, 5-week-old Australian Shepherd siblings that died after displaying severe neurological symptoms upon administration of MilproVet[&#174;] to treat severe intestinal helminth infection. Despite the initial symptoms being similar, their case histories varied in terms of the symptom duration, access to supportive therapy and post-mortem interval. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used to obtain more information about the phase of the pathological processes in the brain, employing protein markers associated with acute hypoxic damage (&#946;-amyloid precursor protein/APP) and apoptosis (diacylglycerolkinase-&#950;/DGK-&#950;, apoptotic protease activating factor 1/Apaf1, and B-cell lymphoma related protein 2/Bcl-2). The results seem to reflect the course of the animals' clinical deterioration, implicating that the hypoxic damage to the brains was incompatible with life, and suggesting the usefulness of the mentioned immunohistochemical markers in clarifying the cause of death in animals with acute neurological deficits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sixty quarter-milk-samples were collected and divided into three groups (n = 20 units each one): clinical mastitis (CM), subclinical mastitis (SCM), and intramammary infection (IMI). The control group consisted of an additional 20 healthy quarters. Their health status was assessed by clinical examination, quantitative somatic cell count (QSCC) and bacteriological milk culture. Finally, a differential somatic cell count (DSCC) was performed on all the milk samples. The mean percentage of macrophages, both in CM- and SCM-quarters, showed a significant difference as compared with the healthy-ones. Significant differences were also detected comparing the mean percentages of polymorphonuclear leukocytes between CM- and healthy-quarters, SCM and healthy, IMI and healthy. The QSCC revealed a weak-significant-negative-correlation with the quantitation of macrophages (r = -0.388), and a moderate-significant-positive-correlation with the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (r = 0.477). Macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed a weak-significant-negative-correlation between them (r = -0.247). The interpretation of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes dynamics in milk provided beneficial information regarding the clinical status of the quarters enrolled. Future studies exploring the potential use of DSCC to improve udder health represent an interesting perspective in these ruminants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aims of this study were to: (1) describe the physical, morphometric, and echocardiographic features of class B1 MMVD-affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines; (2) evaluate the influence of morphometric physical measurements on murmur intensity, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), regurgitant jet size, and indexed mitral valve and annulus measurements. Fifty-two MMVD-affected CKCS were included in the ACVIM class B1. This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study. Morphometric measurements, which included the body, thorax, and head sizes of each dog, were investigated to establish the association with heart murmur intensity, valvular and annular echocardiographic measurements, MVP, and regurgitant jet size, using inverse probability weighting (IPW) analyses to adjust for confounding. The IPW analyses showed that when the head length and nose length decreased, dogs had a more severe regurgitant jet size. Furthermore, subjects with a more pronounced head stop angle had thicker anterior mitral valve leaflets. A brachycephalic morphotype, as seen in dogs similar to the King Charles Spaniel breed in terms of cephalic morphology, is associated with a more severe regurgitant jet size and with valvular characteristics that are related to the most severe forms of MMVD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to its novelty, this study was conducted to elucidate the distribution of aMPV in several provinces in northern Vietnam. By the application of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and nested Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), this study demonstrated the circulation of aMPV in 12 out of 14 cities/provinces with positive rates of 37.6% and 17.2%, respectively. All nested RT-PCR positive samples were aMPV subgroup B. By pairing the detection results with age groups, it was observed that aMPV infections occurred in chickens of all ages. Additionally, by genetic characterization, aMPV strains were demonstrated to not be attenuated vaccine viruses and to belong to at least two genetic clades. Overall, the obtained results provided insights into the prevalence of aMPV and indicated a greater complexity of respiratory diseases in chickens in Vietnam.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we were interested to see if, and how, the ileal transcriptome altered after inulin administration in the pre-weaning period in pigs. Seventy-two Pi&#233;train-Landrace newborn piglets were divided into three groups: (a) a control (CON) group (n = 24), (b) an inulin (IN)-0.5 group (n = 24), and (c) an IN-0.75 group (n = 24). Inulin was provided as a solution and administered twice a day. At week 4, eight piglets per group, those closest to the average in body weight, were sacrificed, and ileal scrapings were collected and analyzed using 3' mRNA massively parallel sequencing. Only minor differences were found, and three genes were differentially expressed between the CON and IN-0.5 group, at an FDR of 10%. All three genes were downregulated in the IN-0.5 group. When comparing the CON group with the IN-0.75 group, five genes were downregulated in the IN-0.75 group, including the three genes seen earlier as differentially expressed between CON and IN-0.5. No genes were found to be differential expressed between IN-0.5 and IN-0.75. Validation of a selection of these genes was done using qRT-PCR. Among the downregulated genes were Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), Aquaporin 7 (AQP7), and Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1). Thus, although only a few genes were found to be differentially expressed, several of them were involved in lipid metabolism, belonging to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and known to promote lipolysis. We, therefore, conclude that these lipid metabolism genes expressed in the ileum may play an important role when supplementing piglets with inulin early in life, before weaning.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, some studies report that up to a quarter of these tumors do not contain detectible BPV1 or BPV2 DNA. The absence of detectible BPV1 or BPV2 in these sarcoids suggests the possible involvement of other papillomavirus types. Currently, five deltapapillomaviruses are recognized to cause mesenchymal neoplasia after cross-species infection. In addition to BPV1 and BPV2, BPV13 has been associated with equine sarcoids in Brazil, BPV14 has been associated with feline sarcoids, and Ovis aries papillomavirus 2 caused a sarcoid-like lesion in a pig. To investigate the cause of equine sarcoids, PCR primers were developed to specifically amplify each of the five different deltapapillomaviruses that have been associated with mesenchymal neoplasia. The specificity of these primers was confirmed using samples of formalin-fixed tissue known to contain each PV type. These primers allow rapid and sensitive detection of deltapapillomavirus DNA in equine sarcoids. As studies have revealed marked regional variability in the cause of equine sarcoids, these primers will be useful to determine the predominant PV type causing sarcoids in a region. Additionally, there is a single report describing mixed infections by BPV1 and BPV2 in equine sarcoids. The specific primer sets are expected to enable more sensitive detection of mixed infections in equine sarcoids. Determining the cause of equine sarcoids is important as vaccines are developed to prevent these common malignant neoplasms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the study was to characterise the clinical course, associated complications and outcome of dogs undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. A retrospective study was conducted. Dogs undergoing emergency laparotomy were included in the study. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables correlated with death and complications. Eighty-two dogs were included in the study. The most common reason for surgery was a gastrointestinal foreign body. Overall, the 15-day mortality rate was 20.7% (17/82). The median (range) length of hospitalisation was 3 (0.5-15) days. Of the 82 patients, 24 (29.3%) developed major complications and 66 (80.5%) developed minor complications. Perioperative factors significantly associated with death included tachycardia (p &lt; 0.001), hypothermia (p &lt; 0.001), lactate acidosis (p &lt; 0.001), shock index &gt; 1 (p &lt; 0.001), leukopenia (p &lt; 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (p &lt; 0.001) at admission, as well as intraoperative hypotension (p &lt; 0.001) and perioperative use of blood products (p &lt; 0.001). The results of this study suggest that mortality and morbidity rates after emergency abdominal surgery in dogs are high.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is widely utilized to facilitate soft and hard tissue healing and has been proposed in periodontal healing in small animal treatment. However, the quality and amount of autologous PRF is compromised in animals with systemic diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of xenologous bubaline blood-derived PRF (bPRF) on periodontal tissue healing in canine periodontal defects. Split-mouth design was employed in twenty dogs diagnosed with periodontal disease. The defects were divided randomly into two groups: the open-flap debridement (OFD)-treated group and the OFD with bPRF (OFD+bPRF) application group. Results demonstrated that gingival index and periodontal probing depth decreased significantly in the OFD+bPRF group compared with those treated with OFD alone. Application of bPRF in periodontal defects also promoted fibrous tissue formation, as confirmed by the marked increase in fibrosis score. bPRF application significantly increased COL1A1 and PDGFB mRNA levels at day 14 compared with the baseline. Taking this evidence together, bPRF provided a favorable therapeutic modality in canine periodontal defects. bPRF could be an alternative biomaterial for the treatment of periodontal defects in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34679041</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Fusion Expression and Immune Effect of PCV2 Cap Protein Tandem Multiantigen Epitopes with CD154/GM-CSF.</Title>	<Abstract>Porcine circovirus associated diseases (PCVAD) is a contagious disease of swine caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). The capsid protein (Cap) is the sole structural protein and the main antigen of PCV2. Cap is the principal immunogenic protein and induces humoral and cellular immunity. CD154 and GM-CSF are immune adjuvants that enhance responses to vaccines. However, whether these two cellular molecules could produce an enhanced effect in PCV2 vaccines still needs to be further studied. The results of PCR and restriction enzyme showed that the recombinant lentiviral plasmids pCDH-TB-Cap, pCDH-TB-Cap-CD154 and pCDH-TB-Cap were successfully constructed. Western blot and IFA showed that the three fusion proteins TB-Cap, TB-Cap-CD154 and TB-Cap-GM-CSF were stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Indirect ELISA assay showed that mice immunized with TB-Cap-CD154 and TB-Cap-GM-CSF fusion proteins produced higher PCV2-specific antibodies than mice immunized with the TB-Cap and a commercial vaccine (p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, lymphocyte proliferation and flow cytometry showed that the cellular immune response of each immune group was significantly enhanced (p &lt; 0.0001). After PCV2 challenge, the results revealed that the viral loads in serum, lung and kidney of all vaccinated groups were significantly lower than the PBS group (p &lt; 0.0001). The transcription levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in the TB-Cap, TB-Cap-CD154 and TB-Cap-GM-CSF groups were significantly higher than those in the PBS and recombinant vaccine groups (p &lt; 0.0001). These results indicated that CD154 and GM-CSF could enhance the ability of TB-Cap protein to induce the body to produce PCV2 specific antibodies and increase the transcription level of cytokines. Thus, CD154 and GM-CSF molecules were a powerful immunoadjuvant for PCV2 subunit vaccines. The novel TB-Cap-CD154 and TB-Cap-GM-CSF subunit vaccine has the potential to be used for the prevention and control of PCVAD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although divergence of genes expression has been found in BC of different human races, no such research of different dog's breeds has been done. The purpose of this study was to investigate expression of the VEGF-B, VEGF-A, FLT-1, KDR, ERBB2, EGFR, GRB2, RAC1, CDH1 and HYAL-1 genes of canine mammary carcinomas, compare the expression levels with clinicopathological parameters and analyze expression disparities between different breeds. Carcinomas and adjacent tissues were collected from female dogs to perform routine histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that VEGF-B and EGFR genes were overexpressed in the mammary gland carcinomas compared to adjacent tissue. VEGF-B gene expression had associations with different parameters (tumor size, grade, and absence of metastasis). Furthermore, differences in VEGF-B, FLT1, ERBB2, GRB2, RAC1, CDH1 and HYAL-1 genes expression have been found in different breed dogs (German Shepherd, Yorkshire Terrier) and mixed-breed dogs indicating that a dog's breed could determine a molecular difference, outcome of cancer and should be accounted as a confounding factor in the future gene expression research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PRF is defined as a biodegradable scaffold containing elevated amounts of platelets and leukocytes having the capability to release high concentrations of bioactive structural proteins and acting as a temporal release healing hemoderivative. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of canine-origin PRF, obtained from blood of screened donors, as a regenerative biomaterial suitable for the treatment of critical wounds in felines. Four short-hair felines with naturally occurring wounds were enrolled in this study. Three of the wounds were considered infected. Each PRF treatment was the result of the grafting of newly produced PRFs at the recipient area. The PRF treatment was initially performed two to three times per week, followed by single weekly treatments. The study was finalized when complete wound closure was achieved. No topical antimicrobial/antiseptic treatment was applied. The present research demonstrated that xenogenic PRFs significantly induced healthy vascularized granulation tissue in lesions with soft tissue deficit, also prompting the epithelization at the injured site. No rejection, necrosis, or infection signs were recorded. Additionally, PRF-therapy was revealed to be a biological cost-effective treatment, accelerating the wound healing process.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This was an observational case series on six German shepherd dogs affected by grade 2 UAP as defined according to their clinical condition as well as radiographic and CT findings. Bone marrow was collected from the iliac crest and the mononuclear fraction was separated with density gradient centrifugation. Cells were suspended in fibrin glue before BMMC administration and implanted via transcutaneous injection under IB or CT guidance, using a spinal needle directly inserted into the ossification centre between the anconeal process and the olecranon. Clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed for up to 6 months. Microradiographic assessment was performed on one dog that died of other causes. A progressive reduction of pain within 3 weeks after BMMC administration was observed in all dogs, with gradually increased weight bearing on the affected limb. Radiographic and CT follow-up revealed the progressive fusion of the ossification centre at 90 days without any signs of secondary OA. The examination of microradiographs showed newly formed bone tissue in which a residue of calcified cartilage was present at the site of BMMC implantation. On the basis of these results, BMMC therapy for grade 2 UAP may be considered to be an effective and minimally invasive treatment option for dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The epidemiological profile of the disease comprises a wide range of hosts, including dogs and cats. Despite several studies about feline Leishmaniosis, the role of cats in disease epidemiology and its clinical impact is still debated. The present study raises awareness about the impact of leishmaniasis in cats from an endemic region in of Northwestern Italy (Liguria). A total number of 250 serum and 282 blood samples were collected from cats, then assessed for Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) serologically using western blot (WB) and molecularly using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also tested the association of Leishmania infection with some infectious agents like haemotropic Mycoplasma, Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) together with the hematobiochemical status of the examined animals. Interestingly, all tested animals were asymptomatic and out of 250 examined serum samples, 33 (13.20%) samples (confidence interval (CI) 95% 9.56-17.96%) were positive at WB for L. infantum, whereas of the 282 blood samples, 80 (28.36%) returned a positive PCR (CI 95% 23.43-33.89%). Furthermore, there was a statistical association between PCR positivity for L. infantum and some hematological parameters besides FIV infection as well as a direct significant correlation between Mycoplasma infection and WB positivity. Taken together, the present findings report high prevalence of L. infantum among cats, which reinforces the significance of such positive asymptomatic animals and confirms the very low humoral response in this species. In addition, the laboratory values provide evidence that infection by the parasite is linked to alteration of some hematological parameters and is correlated to some infectious agents. These data are of interest and suggest future research for accurate diagnosis of such zoonosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34679046</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Teladorsagia Circumcincta Galectin-Mucosal Interactome in Sheep.</Title>	<Abstract>Teladorsagia circumcincta is the most important gastrointestinal parasite in the livestock industry in temperate regions around the world, causing great economic losses. The infective third-stage larvae (L3) of Teladorsagia circumcincta secrete a large number of excretory-secretory (E/S) molecules, some of which are likely to play critical roles in modulating the host immune response. One of the most abundant E/S molecules is a protein termed Tci-gal-1, which has similarity to mammalian galectins. Galectins are a family of carbohydrate-binding molecules, with characteristic domain organisation and affinity for &#946;-galactosids that mediate a variety of important cellular functions including inflammation and immune responses. To understand the role of Tci-gal-1 at the host-parasite interface, we used a proteomics pull-down approach to identify Tc-gal-1 interacting proteins from sheep abomasal scrapes and whole tissue. A total of 135 unique proteins were identified from whole abomasal tissue samples, while 89 proteins were isolated from abomasal scrape samples. Of these proteins, 63 were present in both samples. Many of the host proteins identified, such as trefoil factors and mucin-like proteins, play critical roles in the host response. The identification of Tci-gal-1 binding partners provides new insights on host-parasite interactions and could lead to the development of new control strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty-two healthy New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into seven groups and underwent acupuncture for 20 min in an awake state. Blood samples aseptically collected from the ear vein 3 h before acupuncture and 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after acupuncture were used for the detection of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) and motilin (MTL) in serum. The simple SEA frame was developed successfully, and the acupuncture results showed that the serum AST and ALT levels were significantly higher at 3 h after TEA with high frequency (p &lt; 0.01) compared with the control group. Regarding serum CK-MB levels, no significant differences were found after SEA or TEA stimulation (p &gt; 0.05). Serum MTL levels were significantly increased at 0 h after SEA and TEA (p &lt; 0.05), but there were no significant differences at other time points after SEA and TEA treatment (p &gt; 0.05). SEA not only maintains the effect of TEA but also shortens the circulation loop of the electroacupuncture (EA) current in the body, which effectively avoids body injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the toxic effects of glyphosate suspension (Glyphosate Aria 41% SL, Tehran Iran) on behavior and tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were assessed. For this purpose, a 96 h LC50 of glyphosate suspension (68.788 mL&#183;L[-1]) was used in the toxicity test. All individuals were divided into control and treatment groups with four replicates. Exposure operations were performed under two conditions: increasing concentration of suspension from 0 to 68.788 mL&#183;L[-1]; then, decreasing to the first level. The swimming pattern was recorded by digital cameras during the test and tissue samples were collected at the end of the test. There were significant differences between the swimming pattern of treated individuals and control ones during both steps. The sublethal concentration of glyphosate led to hypertrophy, hyperplasia and hyperemia in the gill of fish. However, changes were obvious only after sampling. The exposed fish also displayed clinical signs such as darkening of the skin and increasing movement of the operculum. Moreover, glyphosate suspension affected swimming patterns of fish suggest that the swimming behavior test can indicate the potential toxicity of environmental pollutants and be used as a noninvasive, useful method for managing environmental changes and assessing fish health conditions by video monitoring.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hoof lesions were clinically assessed, and IRT was used to measure temperature distribution on hoof superficial tissue in 600 multiparous ewes. Binary regression models were developed and validated, and receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated to assess the predictive value and diagnostic performance of IRT for the detection of hoof lesions. The most sensitive prediction model for the detection of IFR was based on the difference between ambient and hoof heel temperature (sensitivity: 83.3%, specificity: 47.8%, and threshold value: 6.5 &#176;C), whereas the most specific prediction model was based on the difference between ambient and coronary band temperature (sensitivity: 51.9%, specificity: 79.7%, and threshold value: 11.3 &#176;C). In the case of WLD, the diagnostic performance of IRT had limited predictive value. IRT could be a useful tool for hoof health screening in dairy sheep. However, it must be cautiously adapted in cases where environmental, operating, and operator variables are not effectively controlled.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both the endocrinopathy and the drug adverse reactions (e.g., hepatotoxicosis, gastrointestinal disorders, and renal injury) are partly due to oxidative stress and redox unbalance. This study investigated the free radical production and the impairment of the antioxidant barrier induced by methimazole in an in vitro model of feline renal epithelium. The protective effects of quercetin and resveratrol were also explored. CRFK cells were incubated with a methimazole concentration equivalent to the maximum plasma levels in orally treated cats (4 &#181;M), in the presence or absence of either one of the two selected antioxidants at different time-points (up to 72 h). Cell viability, ROS production, GSH levels, and mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes (i.e., CAT, SOD, GPx, and GST) were assessed. Methimazole impaired cell viability and increased ROS levels in a time-dependent manner. Similarly, GSH content and CAT, SOD, and GPx3 expression were higher compared with control cells. Such effects were significantly counteracted by quercetin. These results provide new insights about the mechanisms underlying the methimazole-related side effects frequently observed in hyperthyroid cats. They also support the use of quercetin in the management of feline hyperthyroidism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in dogs with chronic hepatitis. There were 62.2% of dogs with chronic hepatitis accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or both. Positive correlations were observed between serum ALT and cholesterol (r = 0.8287, p &lt; 0.01), serum ALP and cholesterol (r = 0.8436, p &lt; 0.01), serum GGT and cholesterol (r = 0.5640, p &lt; 0.01), serum bile acid and cholesterol (r = 0.3310, p &lt; 0.01) and serum ALP and triglycerides (r = 0.2582, p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between ultrasound scores of diseased dogs with and without hypertriglyceridemia and diseased dogs with and without hypercholesterolemia. Canine chronic hepatitis is associated with hyperlipidemia. A significant positive association was identified between hyperlipidemia, especially hypercholesterolemia, liver enzymes, and bile acid concentration in dogs suffering from chronic hepatitis. The underlying mechanisms connecting hyperlipidemia and canine chronic hepatitis remain elusive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been more than a decade since the establishment of first transfection for Babesia bovis, the causative agent of bovine babesiosis. However, the number of genes that were targeted by genetic tools in Babesia parasites is limited. This is partially due to the low efficiencies of these methods. The recent adaptation of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing of Babesia bovis can accelerate the efforts for dissecting this parasite's genome and extend the knowledge on biological aspects of erythrocytic and tick stages of Babesia. Additionally, glmS ribozyme as a conditional knockdown system is available that could be used for the characterization of essential genes. The development of high throughput genetic tools is needed to dissect the function of multigene families, targeting several genes in a specific pathway, and finally genome-wide identification of essential genes to find novel drug targets. In this review, we summarized the current tools that are available for Babesia and the genes that are being targeted by these tools. This may draw a perspective for the future development of genetic tools and pave the way for the identification of novel drugs or vaccine targets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

ASF is characterized by a short incubation period and immediate death, making the early identification of ASF-infected pigs essential. This pilot-scale study evaluates whether the infrared thermography (IRT) technique can be used as a diagnostic tool to detect changes in skin temperature (Tsk) during the early stages of disease development in experimentally ASF-infected pigs. Clinical symptoms and rectal temperatures (Tcore) were recorded daily, and IRT readings during the experimental ASF infection were analyzed. All infected pigs died at 5-8 days post inoculation (dpi), and the incubation period was approximately 4 dpi. The average Tcore increased from 0 dpi (38.9 &#177; 0.3 &#176;C) to 7 dpi (41.0 &#177; 0.5 &#176;C) and decreased by 8 dpi (39.8 &#177; 0 &#176;C). The maximum Tsk of ASF-infected pigs increased from 2 (35.0 &#176;C) to 3 dpi (38.5 &#176;C). The mean maximum Tsk observed from three regions on the skin (ear, inguinal, and neck) significantly increased from 2 to 3 dpi. This study presents a non-contact method for the early detection of ASF in infected pigs using thermal imaging at 3 days after ASF infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 2-year-old castrated male Korean domestic shorthair feline had megacolon and pelvic canal stenosis. The ratio of the maximal diameter of the colon to the L5 length and the pelvic canal diameter ratio were 1.6 and 0.45, respectively. Pelvic SDO was performed with a PMMA spacer, leading to pelvic canal enlargement (pelvic canal diameter ratio: 0.73). Two days after surgery, dysuria was identified immediately after removing the preoperatively placed urinary catheter. Complete blood counts and serum biochemical profiles were within the reference intervals, and a positive contrast retrograde urethrogram confirmed urethral obstruction at the level of the membranous-pelvic urethra region. Increased tension of the IM leading to a narrowed urethra was suspected as the cause of urethral obstruction. After IM release at the level of origin on the ischium, the patient had an uneventful recovery with spontaneous urination. Muscle release resulted in excellent functional restoration, with no intraoperative or postoperative complications reported during the 12-month long-term follow-up. Therefore, SDO with IM release could be a feasible therapeutic option for severe pelvic stenosis without complications, such as urethral obstruction, in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34679056</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Therapy Dog Welfare Revisited: A Review of the Literature.</Title>	<Abstract>During the past decade, the field of human-animal interaction(s) research has been characterized by a significant increase in scientific findings. These data have contributed to our current understanding of how humans may benefit from contact with animals. However, the animal experience of these interactions is still an under-researched area. This paper addresses the welfare of dogs who participate in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) to improve health in human recipients. This paper builds on previous work by Glenk (2017) and provides an updated review of the literature on therapy dog welfare published from 2017-2021. New advances in scientific methodology, such as the determination of salivary oxytocin, breath rate and tympanic membrane temperature, are analyzed regarding their value and limitations for research in AAIs. Moreover, welfare-related social and environmental factors (e.g., freedom of choice, exploration of novel environments, inequity aversion, individual development, working experience, relationship with handler and handler skills) that profoundly influence dog perception and well-being are reviewed and discussed. Accounting for the globally increasing interest and the number of dogs utilized in AAIs, safeguarding therapy dog well-being, and identifying situations, circumstances and protocols that may challenge animal welfare remains an emerging and crucial area of scientific effort.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Neurological examination revealed ventral flexion of the neck, a wide-based stance in the hindlimb, wide excursions of the head from side to side, tremor in all four limbs, hypermetria in all four limbs, proprioceptive deficits in all four limbs, reduced patellar reflex in both hindlimbs, and postural vertical nystagmus. Later, behavioral and cognitive dysfunction, ataxia, and visual deficits slowly progressed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical progressive atrophy of the whole brain and cervical spinal cord. Bilateral retinal degeneration was observed, and both flush and flicker electroretinograms were bilaterally non-recordable at the age of five years and eight months, and the dog was euthanized. Histopathologically, faint-to-moderate deposition of light-brown pigments was frequently observed in the cytoplasm of neurons throughout the cerebrum, cerebellum, and nuclei of the brainstem. The pigments were positive for Luxol fast blue, periodic acid-Schiff, and Sudan black B, and exhibited autofluorescence. Electron microscopic examination revealed the accumulation of membranous material deposition in the neuronal cytoplasm. Small foci of pigment-containing macrophages were frequently observed around the capillary vessels. Based on these clinical and pathological findings, the animal was diagnosed with adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In addition, the increasing popularity and utilisation of woody plants remain common in traditional medicine, which may be attributed to their inherent benefits. The current review was aimed at analysing ethnoveterinary surveys, biological activities, and secondary metabolites/phytochemical profiles of the woody plants of South Africa. Eligible literature (period: 2000 to 2020) were retrieved from different databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Sabinet, and Science Direct. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 ethnoveterinary surveys were eligible and were subjected to further analysis. We identified 104 woody plant species from 44 plant families that are used in the treatment of different diseases in animals, particularly cattle (70%) and goats (20%). The most mentioned (with six citations) woody plants were Terminalia sericea Burch. ex DC and Ziziphus mucronata Willd., which were followed by plants with five (Cussonia spicata Thunb., Pterocarpus angolensis DC and Vachellia karroo (Hayne) Banfi &amp; Galasso) or four (Acokanthera oppositifolia (Lam.) Codd, Cassia abbreviata Oliv., and Strychnos henningsii Gilg) individual mentions. The most dominant families were Fabaceae (19%), Apocynaceae (5.8%), Rubiaceae (5.8%), Anacardiaceae (4.8%), Combretaceae (4.8%), Euphorbiaceae (4.8%), Malvaceae (4.8%), Rhamnaceae (4.8%), and Celastraceae (3.8%). Bark (33%), leaves (29%), and roots (19%) were the plant parts dominantly used to prepare remedies for ethnoveterinary medicine. An estimated 20% of woody plants have been screened for antimicrobial, anthelmintic, antioxidant, and cytotoxicity effects. Phytochemical profiles established a rich pool of valuable secondary metabolites (phenolic, flavonoids and condensed tannins) that may be responsible for the exerted biological activities. Overall, the significant portion of woody plants lacking empirical evidence on their biological effects indicates a major knowledge gap that requires more research efforts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to facilitate the identification of mast cells (MCs) during immunohistochemical analysis of membrane and/or nuclear markers, we propose a new staining method that includes the association of IHC and toluidine blue as a counterstain. To achieve this goal, we tested c-kit, Ki67, and cannabinoid receptor 2 on several cases of cutaneous canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), cutaneous mastocytosis, and atopic dermatitis. The results obtained show how this double staining technique, although limited to non-cytoplasmic markers and of little use in poorly differentiated MCTs in which MC metachromasia is hard to see, can be used during the evaluation of nuclear and/or membranous immunohistochemical markers in all canine cutaneous disorders, especially if characterized by the presence of a low number of MCs. It can help to evaluate those MCTs in which neoplastic MCs must be clearly distinguished from inflammatory cells that can infiltrate the tumor itself, in facilitating the calculation of the Ki67 index. Moreover, it can be used to study the expression of new markers in both animal and human tissues containing MCs and in MC disorders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been reported that risperidone, an antipsychotic drug, effectively protects neuronal cell death from transient ischemia injury in gerbil brains. However, until now, studies on the effects of risperidone on spinal cord injury after asphyxial CA (ACA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are not sufficient. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of risperidone on hind limb motor deficits and neuronal damage/death in the lumbar part of the spinal cord following ACA in rats. Mortality, severe motor deficits in the hind limbs, and the damage/death (loss) of motor neurons located in the anterior horn were observed two days after ACA/CPR. These symptoms were significantly alleviated by risperidone (an atypical antipsychotic) treatment after ACA. In vehicle-treated rats, the immunoreactivities of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1&#946;), as pro-inflammatory cytokines, were increased, and the immunoreactivities of IL-4 and IL-13, as anti-inflammatory cytokines, were reduced with time after ACA/CPR. In contrast, in risperidone-treated rats, the immunoreactivity of the pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly decreased, and the anti-inflammatory cytokines were enhanced compared to vehicle-treated rats. In brief, risperidone treatment after ACA/CPR in rats significantly improved the survival rate and attenuated paralysis, the damage/death (loss) of motor neurons, and inflammation in the lumbar anterior horn. Thus, risperidone might be a therapeutic agent for paraplegia by attenuation of the damage/death (loss) of spinal motor neurons and neuroinflammation after ACA/CPR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both groups were transported from the southeast tropical region of Mexico to a feedlot in the northeast and were sampled on the same day. The complete blood count, blood chemistry, and cytokine gene expression were analyzed. Gene expression was analyzed using specific primers to amplify and quantify the cDNA reverse transcribed from the mRNA transcripts for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, interferon (IFN)-&#947;, and interleukin (IL)-2. Higher values for hematocrit (p = 0.029), hemoglobin (p = 0.002), eosinophils (0.029), albumin (p = 0.014), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.004), bilirubin (p = 0.003), cholesterol (p = 0.014), and cortisol (p = 0.051) were observed in the 0 DPA group than the 25 DPA group. In the electrophoresis of TNF-&#945; amplification products, two non-specific bands were observed in the 0 DPA group. These bands were sequenced, and BLAST analysis suggested that they corresponded to bovine lymphotoxin and have not been reported previously related to stress. The TNF-&#945; expression level was higher (p = 0.001) in the 25 DPA group than the 0 DPA group according to the semi-quantitative expression analysis. This may indicate a persistent inflammatory process that could be related to trauma and disease, which can negatively impact their subsequent health and growth performance. In conclusion, homeostatic disruption was apparent in the 0 DPA heifers, which showed higher cortisol and reductions in TNF-&#945; levels and stress-induced bovine lymphotoxin (SIBL) co-expression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We evaluated the impact of two dietary protein levels in sow late gestation diet and piglet nursery diet on piglet metabolism. Diets met or exceeded the crude protein and amino acid requirements. Sows received either 12% (Lower, L) or 17% (Higher, H) crude protein (CP) during the last five weeks of gestation, and piglets received 16.5% (L) or 21% (H) CP from weaning at age 3.5 weeks. This resulted in a 2 &#215; 2 factorial design with four sow/piglet diet treatment groups: HH and LL (match), HL and LH (mismatch). Piglet hepatic tissues were sampled and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by RNA sequencing. At age 4.5 weeks, 25 genes were downregulated and 22 genes were upregulated in the mismatch compared to match groups. Several genes involved in catabolic pathways were upregulated in the mismatch compared to match groups, as were genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. The results show a distinct interaction effect between maternal and nursery diets, implying that sow late gestation diet could be used to optimize piglet metabolism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They provide support for soft tissues and hematopoiesis and undergo continuous renewal throughout life. In addition, vitamin D is involved in regulating bone and calcium homeostasis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a &#946;-galactoside-binding protein that can regulate bone cell differentiation and function. Here, we aimed to study the regulatory effects of Gal-3 on vitamin-D-regulated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in chicken. Gal-3 expression in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from 18-day-old chicken embryos was inhibited or overexpressed. BMSCs were then co-cultured with bone marrow monocytes/macrophages (BMMs) with or without addition of 1&#945;,25(OH)2D3. The results showed that 1&#945;,25(OH)2D3 upregulated the expression of Gal-3 mRNA and receptor activator of nuclear-factor &#954;B ligand (RANKL) expression in BMSCs and promoted osteoclastogenesis, as shown by the upregulated expression of osteoclast (OC) markers (CtsK, CAII, MMP-9, and TRAP) and increased bone resorption, a method for measuring the bone resorption area in vitro. Knockdown of Gal-3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in BMSCs downregulated the expression of RANKL mRNA and attenuated the effects of 1&#945;,25(OH)2D3 on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Conversely, overexpression of Gal-3 in BMSCs enhanced the effects of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by increasing the expression of RANKL mRNA. These results demonstrated that Gal-3 mediates the differentiation and bone resorption of osteoclasts regulated by 1&#945;,25(OH)2D3.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Researchers took heed of this call to action by developing an innovative way to collect data to assess the physiological indicators of stress in equine participants. The collection of saliva is considered to be a minimally invasive method of data collection and is typically performed using a cotton swab; however, in equines, the introduction of a foreign object may induce stress; (2) Methods: Researchers used a modified bit to collect pooled saliva in an effort to further reduce stress during the saliva collection process. Additionally, the collection of pooled saliva, via the bit, increases the opportunity to consider additional analyses, such as oxytocin, which is more reliable in pooled saliva than site-specific saliva captured with a swab; (3) Results: A data analysis demonstrated that ample saliva was captured using the modified bit. Observational data supported that the horses demonstrated fewer physical stress signals to the bit than to the swab. Thus, the modified bit is a feasible and valid method for equine salivary sample collection; (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that the modified bit provides a viable method to collect equine saliva and supports national calls to prioritize animal welfare analysis, specifically for horses used within EAS. Future research should enhance methodological rigor, including in the process and timing, thereby contributing to the bit's validation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we report the development of a novel, RNA-based in situ hybridization technique (RNAscope) to detect PRRS virus (PRRSV) RNA in lung tissues of experimentally infected animals. The technique was applied to lung tissues of 20 piglets, which had been inoculated with a wild-type, highly pathogenic PRRSV-1 strain. To determine the RNAscope's applicability as a semi-quantitative method, we analysed the association between the proportion of the virus-infected cells measured with an image analysis software (QuPath) and the outcome of the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests performed in parallel. The results of the quantitative approach of these two molecular biological methods show significant association (pseudo R[2] = 0.3894, p = 0.004). This is the first time RNAscope assay has been implemented for the detection of PRRSV-1 in experimental animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study was conducted from 2019 to 2020 in five governorates situated in Northern Egypt. Serum samples from 450 asymptomatic dogs were serologically examined by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</Abstract><Abstract>Overall, the seroprevalence rate of CanL was 21.3% and the highest rates were observed in Cairo and Giza governorates. The univariable analysis revealed that the seropositivity of CanL was strongly related to the dogs' ages, length of hair, absence of veterinary care or application of insecticides, and the type of floor of their shelters. The risk factors that were found to be associated with CanL in exposed dogs were: age group 2-4 years old (OR = 12, 95% CI: 1.6-92.3); short hair (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6); absence of veterinary care (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.8); no application of insecticides (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.5-6.5) and their residence in a shelter with an earthen floor (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.7-2.9).</Abstract><Abstract>Based on the present results, CanL is present in Egyptian dogs and this increases the possibility of transmission by sand fly to humans with whom they have contact. Consequently, an efficient monitoring programme and effective control measures are important to reduce the risk of infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Calabria (southern Italy), many plants have been used in ethnoveterinary medicine for parasite control in small ruminants. Here, we present an in vivo evaluation of anthelmintic efficacy of three plant extracts. The first was based on bark and leaves of Salix caprea, the second and the third were based on the whole plant Artemisia campestris and whole fruit (seeds and peel) of Punica granatum, respectively. Anthelmintic efficacy was evaluated according to the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) performed with the FLOTAC technique. The results showed a significant anthelmintic effect of Punica granatum macerate (50%), a low effectiveness of the Artemisia campestris macerate (20%), and a complete ineffectiveness of Salix caprea macerate (0.1%). With these outcomes, we report a P. granatum-based remedy reducing 50% GIN egg output. This result was obtained without using any synthetic drug, paving the way for the employment of green veterinary pharmacology (GVP) as a complementary and sustainable method to reduce the use of chemicals and to counteract anthelmintic resistance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The condition of the respiratory system caused by the IB virus in chickens has many similarities with the pathology of the respiratory system caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The effectiveness of virucidal drugs (Argovit, Triviron, Ecocid, and lauric acid monoglyceride) was tested on chickens inoculated with a tenfold dose of a vaccine strain based on the attenuated virus H120 against IB of chickens. On the 6th day after inoculation, inflammatory changes in the intestines, lungs, and thymus were observed in the control group. The experimental groups were characterized by less pronounced inflammatory reactions and a lower proportion of thymus and lung probes containing genomic IB virus RNA. Since the virucidal activity of four orally administrated formulations was possible only in the intestine, the experimental data indirectly confirmed the hypothesis of the possibility of the predominant accumulation of coronaviruses in the intestine and subsequent lung damage due to the hematogenous redistribution of viral particles and IBV antigens. It was suggested that other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 can implement a similar mechanism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

BCL retention and tolerance were evaluated in 10 healthy canines via a single-masked, crossover study for 7 days. To compare in vitro bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, four Staphylococcus strains were incubated with the BCLs at 37 &#176;C for 2 or 24 h, and the bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) adhering to the BCLs were counted. Next, to compare in vivo bacterial adhesion, the CFUs of bacteria adhering to the BCLs worn by canines for 24 h were counted. Anionic lenses significantly retained and reduced in vitro bacterial adhesion than in the zwitterionic lenses. However, the amount of in vitro biofilm formation was more likely to be higher on anionic lenses than on zwitterionic lenses. In vivo bacterial adhesion was not significantly different between the two types of BCLs. Nevertheless, both BCLs were well-tolerated by the canines; thus, their short-term use in dogs can be recommended as safe.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34679070</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Are Anthelminthic Treatments of Captive Ruminants Necessary?</Title>	<Abstract>Anthelmintics are frequently administered to animals to limit fecal egg elimination, so that wild animals in captive breeding programs are treated to maintain a proper health condition. This is effective from a health management perspective, but on the other hand, it could prevent captive animals from developing an effective immunity against parasites that they might encounter when reintroduced into their original geographic areas. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of parasite infections in captive Cuvier's gazelles (Gazella cuvieri) not treated with anthelmintics for two years and to evaluate the factors related to their fecal egg shedding. Fifteen one-year-old males were enclosed together and captured monthly to collect feces directly from the rectum. Fecal egg counts were performed, and eggs were classified as strongylid-like, Nematodirus sp., or Trichuris sp. Fecal egg shedding for the three groups of parasites did not vary significantly over the duration of the study. Only precipitation affected the egg-shedding pattern of all parasites, while inbreeding was positively associated with the number of strongylid-like parasites. These findings suggest an equilibrium between hosts and parasites in absence of treatment during the study. The anthelmintic treatment as a systematic prophylaxis method in captive animals should be avoided and replaced by systematic coprological and clinical vigilance, as well as targeted treatment in the case of a significant rise of fecal egg counts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eleven client-owned dogs with acute thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusions were included in this retrospective case-series. Dogs were diagnosed with acute thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusions using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MED was performed with an integrated endoscopic system to the affected intervertebral disc. Surgery time, intra-operative complications, causes of conversion to microscopic surgery if necessary, post-operative complications, and neurological status on presentation at discharge, as well as any further evaluations in hospital, and long-term concerns via owner contact, were recorded. Post-operative CT images were obtained to compare the extent of laminectomy performed to the planned region of laminectomy. The fully endoscopic procedure was completed in eight dogs without major complications. Three cases were converted to an open surgery due to difficulty removing extruded disc material and controlling hemorrhage. The clinical outcome was good in all cases and equivalent to previously reported prognoses after open surgery. MED is an effective and safe alternative to conventional open procedures in dogs with acute thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we investigated possible new diagnostic/follow-up markers in IL dogs, namely, serum C-reactive protein, serum bacterial lipopolysaccharide, serum cleaved cytokeratin 18, serum citrulline, and zonulin (in both serum and feces). A fecal proteomic study looking for possible confirmation and/or new marker candidates was also performed. All markers in both substrates, with the exception of serum citrulline, significantly differed between diseased and control dogs. Fecal proteomics allowed the retrieval of three proteins in IL dogs (Fc fragment of IgG-binding protein; transthyretin; proproteinase E) that were not previously found in clinically healthy subjects. Although further studies are needed, C-reactive protein, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, cleaved cytokeratin 18, and zonulin (in both serum and feces) resulted as promising markers for canine IL; similarly, fecal proteomics represents a road worthy of being pursued in the search for candidate biomarkers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

NAC is applied in poultry with aflatoxin B1 intoxication as an antioxidant, but its pharmacokinetics are not known. The present study was conducted to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of orally administered NAC in broilers. It included 32 chickens, divided into four groups, treated with NAC at a dose rate of 100 mg/kg/day mixed with the feed: healthy broilers (n = 6); chickens infected with Mycoplasma gallisepticum (n = 10); healthy broilers (n = 6); and diseased chickens (n = 10) treated with NAC and doxycycline (via drinking water, 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)). Plasma concentrations were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry (MS)/MS. NAC was absorbed after oral administration in all four groups of chickens. In healthy chickens treated solely with NAC, maximum plasma concentrations of 2.26 &#177; 0.91 &#181;g mL[-1] were achieved at 2.47 &#177; 0.45 h after dosing. The value of absorption half-life was 1.04 &#177; 0.53 h. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that dose adjustment of NAC is not required in M. gallisepticum-infected broilers or when it is combined with doxycycline.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cat had been adopted at 3 months of age. Physical exam showed cyanosis, dyspnea and mild hypothermia. The "spot test" was supportive of methemoglobinemia. Co-oximetry blood gas analysis revealed severe methemoglobinemia (81.40%), severe hyperchloremia and mild hyponatremia. CBC, biochemistry and urinalysis were within normal limits, blood smear showed the presence of Heinz bodies. Treatment was instituted with oxygen therapy, methylene blue 1% solution, ascorbic acid, intravenous fluid therapy. The clinical course was favorable with rapid improvement of cyanosis and methemoglobinemia (4.2%). Acquired methemoglobinemia was hypothesized. Two weeks after discharge the cat was asymptomatic but mild methemoglobinemia (15.60%) and hyperchloremia were evident. Exposure to oxidants contained in drinking water was suspected so the owners were instructed to use bottled water only. One month later the cat was asymptomatic, and methemoglobinemia and chloremia were within normal limits. Even if a congenital form due to cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency cannot be ruled out, drinking water intoxication is the most likely cause of methemoglobinemia in this cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ovariohysterectomy was performed using the lateral flank approach to avoid complications that can occur with ventral celiotomy. Surgery was performed successfully despite unexpected rupture of the uterus which had occurred before the surgery. The lion recovered uneventfully and continued to do well at the 1 year follow up after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ovariohysterectomy with the lateral flank approach in a lion with pyometra. Our report suggests that ovariohysterectomy with the lateral flank approach could be considered as an alternative method for pyometra in wild big cats with risk of complications at the surgical site.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822619</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Bayesian Estimation of Diagnostic Accuracy of Three Diagnostic Tests for Bovine Tuberculosis in Egyptian Dairy Cattle Using Latent Class Models.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of the present study was to calculate the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the single cervical tuberculin test (SCT), rapid lateral flow test (RLFT), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection in Egyptian dairy cattle herds within a Bayesian framework. The true M. bovis infection within-herd prevalence was assessed as a secondary objective. Data on the test results of SCT, RLFT, and RT-PCR for the detection of M. bovis were available from 245 cows in eleven herds in six major governorates in Egypt. A Bayesian latent class model was built for the estimation of the characteristics of the three tests. Our findings showed that Se of SCT (0.93 (95% Posterior credible interval (PCI): 0.89-0.93)) was higher than that of RT-PCR (0.83 (95% PCI: 0.28-0.93)) but was similar to the Se of RLFT (0.93 (95% PCI: 0.31-0.99)). On the contrary, SCT showed the lowest Sp estimate (0.60 (95% PCI: 0.59-0.65)), whereas Sp estimates of RT-PCR (0.99 (95% PCI: 0.95-1.00)) and RLFT (0.99 (95% PCI: 0.95-1.00)) were comparable. The true prevalence of M. bovis ranged between 0.07 and 0.71. In conclusion, overall, RT-PCR and RLFT registered superior performance to SCT, making them good candidates for routine use in the Egyptian bovine tuberculosis control program.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822620</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Clinical and Correlated Responses among Steroid Hormones and Oxidant/Antioxidant Biomarkers in Pregnant, Non-Pregnant and Lactating CIDR-Pre-Synchronized Dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius).</Title>	<Abstract>Overproduction of free radicals is controlled by antioxidant defense mechanisms. These defense mechanisms are achieved by antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT). The current study aimed to assess the changes in steroid hormones, oxidant/antioxidants biomarkers, lipid profiles/liver functions indices, renal function biomarkers and minerals metabolism in non-pregnant, lactating or pregnant one-humped she-camels (Camelus dromedarius) pre-synchronized with controlled internal drug releasing. The study also focused on the correlational relationships between steroid hormones and the oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers, lipid profiles and liver functions indices, renal functions and mineral metabolism in these she-camels. The study was conducted on apparently healthy dromedary she-camels (n = 60) during breeding season. A sexually active camel-bull was introduced to she-camels pre-synchronized with CIDR. Fifty to sixty days after natural mating, she-camels were examined for pregnancy. She-camels were divided into three main groups according to both pregnancy and lactation as following: pregnant (PREG, n = 38) which was kept as control one, non-pregnant and lactating (LACT, n = 8), and non-pregnant and non-lactating she-camels (NPREG, n= 14). Steroid hormones, i.e., progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2) and cortisol, oxidant indictors, i.e., malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant biomarkers, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), CAT and reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid profiles indices, renal functions and related minerals were assessed. The present study confirmed the efficacy of using CIDR for synchronization in she-camels. Significant elevations in serum steroids hormones in PREG compare with LACT and NPREG. The highest concentrations of MDA as lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress indictors and lowest levels of antioxidant biomarkers except for SOD, i.e., TAC, CAT and GSH, were reported in PREG compared with LACT and NPREG. PREG showed the highest liver enzymes activities and lowest total protein values. Remarkable increases in serum concentrations of renal function parameters and phosphorous (P) were observed in PREG when compared with the other two groups. The investigated she-camels revealed significant correlation between steroid hormones and the oxidant biomarkers, antioxidant biomarkers, liver functions, renal functions and minerals metabolism parameters. P4 showed positive correlations with antioxidant biomarkers, i.e., TAC, CAT and GSH, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, whereas negative correlations were reported between P4 and renal functions biomarkers, i.e., blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and creatinine kinase (CK), and minerals metabolism parameters, i.e., P and magnesium (Mg), in CIDR pre-synchronized she-camels. In contrast, E2 and cortisol showed negative correlations with antioxidant biomarkers, i.e., TAC, CAT and GSH, lipid profiles/liver functions indices, i.e., AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and &#947;-glutamyl transferase (GGT), CK and Mg, however, positive correlations were demonstrated between E2 and cortisol, and MDA, Cr and P in investigated she-camels. In conclusion, the present study confirmed the efficacy of using CIDR for synchronization in she-camels. The highest MDA levels as indictors for oxidative stress and the lowest antioxidant levels, i.e., TAC, CAT and GSH, except for SOD in pregnant she-camels, were attributable to physiological oxidative stress as excellent compensatory responses observed in the PREG group to face such a physiologic stage. Moreover, lower P levels in non-pregnant she-camels would be contributed to failure of conception or early embryonic death. The investigated she-camels revealed significant correlations between steroid hormones and the oxidant indicators, antioxidant biomarkers, lipid profile indices and renal functions biomarkers that provided better understanding for physiological stress during pregnancy in camels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822621</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Immunofluorescent Localization of Plakoglobin Is Altered in Endomyocardial Biopsy Samples from Dogs with Clinically Relevant Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC).</Title>	<Abstract>Diagnosing the early stages of canine Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is complicated by day-to-day arrhythmia variability, and absence of reliable, transthoracic echocardiographic features. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic identification of transmural fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricle. Reduction of immunofluorescent signal for plakoglobin (PG) at the intercalated disc (ID) is reported in ARVC-affected humans and boxers. Our objective was to determine whether reduced immunofluorescent signal for PG in endomyocardial biopsy samples (EMBs) correspond with a histopathologic diagnosis of ARVC. Here, 49 dogs were evaluated: 43 with advanced cardiac disease and 6 non-clinical boxers with mild to moderate ventricular arrhythmia (VA) burden. EMBs were obtained from all dogs; samples were prepared with antibodies recognizing cadherin (PC) and PG and evaluated with confocal microscopy. Investigators were blinded to breed and clinical status. ARVC was histopathologically diagnosed in 8 out of 49 dogs. Of these, three out of eight had clinical signs consistent with ARVC (two boxers, one English bulldog) and reduced PG signal at ID; five out of eight were non-clinical boxers with moderate VA and no reduction in PG. A total of 41 out of 49 dogs were histopathologically diagnosed with non-ARVC cardiac disease; 1 out of 41 showed reduction of PG at ID, while 40 out of 41 had no PG reduction. These results suggest that EMB PG signal is reduced in dogs with advanced ARVC, but not in the occult phase of the disease. Additionally, presence of PG at ID supports a diagnosis of non-ARVC cardiac disease in dogs with clinical signs. These results may offer an additional test that helps differentiate advanced ARVC from other myocardial diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A selected group of 10 Charolais cows was treated in autumn 2020 with ABZ at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight. Another group of 10 cows remained untreated as a control. The faecal egg count reduction test was used to determine in vivo efficacy. The percentage reduction of eggs on day 14 after treatment ranged from 77 to 81.8%, depending on the formula used for calculation. The in vitro egg hatch test (EHT) was used as a second diagnostic method. F. hepatica eggs for the EHT were isolated from faecal samples. The test was performed in two versions differing in the length of incubation with ABZ (12 h and 15 d). The percentage of eggs with inhibited development at a concentration of 0.5 &#956;M in both versions of the EHT agreed with the in vivo results. Ovicidal activity at a concentration of 0.5 &#956;M in the 12-h version suggested a reduced efficacy of ABZ (65.40%). An EHT prepared using pooled faecal samples was a prospective method for the detection of efficacy and ABZ resistance in F. hepatica.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This descriptive study examined the impact of mobility dog partnership on kinematics of individuals in the normal young adult population. Sixteen participants were video recorded while walking in a straight line for 3.7 m (12 feet) under three different conditions (ambulating with no device, ambulating with a standard cane on the left side, and ambulating with a mobility dog on the left side). Differences between joint angles under each of the conditions were analyzed. Statistically significant differences were found in left elbow flexion when comparing ambulating with a cane versus ambulating with no device; left shoulder abduction when comparing ambulating with a cane versus ambulating with a mobility dog, ambulating with a mobility dog versus no device, and ambulating with a cane versus no device; and left hip extension when comparing ambulating with a mobility dog versus no device, and when ambulating with a mobility dog versus a cane. These findings suggest that providers should evaluate and monitor potential negative impacts of assistive devices such as mobility dogs on human kinematics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Six hundred, one day old unsexed quail were divided into four groups, the control group (G1) received plain drinking water, while G2, G3, and G4 were supplemented with LC and/or TE, respectively. The treated groups recorded a significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement in the final body weight, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, phagocytic activity %, phagocytic index, lymphocytes %, and plasma glutathione level compared to the G1. On the other hand, these supplementations significantly lower the mortality rate %, heterophil %, H/L ratio and plasma malondialdehyde level of the supplemented groups relative to G1. The supplemented groups recorded a non-significant increase in duodenal histomorphometric parameters (villous height, villous width, surface area, and crypt depth) relative to G1. Generally, LC and/or TE improve the values of economic profile (total returns, net profit, total return/total costs %, etc.) in treated groups compared to the control one. In conclusion, L-carnitine supplementation was more effective than TE or their combination with TE in the immunological, anti-oxidative, growth, and economic performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Serum samples and vaginal swabs from goats with different reproductive statuses were collected. Cows, cats, and a dog were investigated with the same sample matrix. The farmer's family was examined by serum samples. Ruminant sera were analyzed with two phase-specific enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs). Dominant immunoglobulin G (IgG) phase II levels reflected current infections in goats. The cows had high IgG phase I and II levels indicating ongoing infections. Feline, canine, and human sera tested positive by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Animal vaginal swabs were analyzed by qPCR to detect C. burnetii, and almost all tested positive. A new cattle-associated C. burnetii genotype C16 was identified by the Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA/VNTR) from ruminant samples. Additionally, a possible influence of 17&#223;-estradiol on C. burnetii antibody response was evaluated in goat sera. Goats in early/mid-pregnancy had significantly lower levels of phase-specific IgGs and 17&#223;-estradiol than goats in late pregnancy. We conclude that the cattle herd may have transmitted C. burnetii to the pregnant goat herd, resulting in a Q fever outbreak with one acute human case. The influence of placentation and maternal pregnancy hormones during pregnancy on the immune response is discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Marker vaccines are effective in controlling infectious diseases including IBR, because they allow the discrimination between the natural infection and the vaccination. Therefore, a triple gene deleted strain BoHV-1 gG-/tk-/gE- was developed and evaluated in vivo and in vitro as a marker vaccine. In cell culture, this triple mutant virus showed significantly slower growth kinetics and smaller plaques when compared to wild-type (wt) BoHV-1 and double mutant BoHV-1 gG-/tk- (p &lt; 0.01). On proteomic level, it revealed downregulation of some virulence related proteins including thymidine kinase, glycoproteins G, E, I, and K when compared to the wt. In vitro, the triple mutant virus showed a significantly lower and shorter viral shedding period (p &lt; 0.001) in calves compared to double mutant. Moreover, the immunized calves with triple mutant virus showed protection rates of 64.2% and 68.6% against wt BoHV-1 and wt BoHV-5 challenge, respectively, without reactivation of latency after dexamethasone injection. In conclusion, BoHV-1 gG-/tk-/gE- is a safer marker vaccine against IBR although its immunogenicity in calves was decreased when compared to double mutant virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822627</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Recognizing and Mitigating Canine Stress during Animal Assisted Interventions.</Title>	<Abstract>Animal-assisted Interventions (AAI) proliferated rapidly since clinicians and researchers first noted the positive effects animals have on people struggling with physical and mental health concerns. The intersection of AAI with the field of animal welfare evolved from considering animals' basic needs, such as freedom from pain, to recognition that animals experience nuanced emotions. Current conceptualizations of the various roles of companion animals as an adjunct to treatments for humans emphasize not only the animals' physical comfort and autonomy, but also their mental well-being and enjoyment of AAI activities. However, numerous challenges to effective monitoring of animals involved in AAI exist. This article focuses specifically on dogs, highlighting factors that may lead handlers and therapists to miss or ignore canine stress signals during human-animal interactions and offers strategies to recognize and ameliorate dogs' distress more consistently. The primary goals of this discussion are to summarize the current thinking on canine well-being and to highlight practical applications of animal welfare principles in real-world AAI settings. The paper highlights contextual factors (e.g., physical setting, patient demand), human influences (e.g., desire to help), and intervention characteristics (e.g., presence or absence of a dog-specific advocate) that may promote or inhibit humans' ability to advocate for therapy dogs during AAI activities. Deidentified examples of each of these factors are discussed, and recommendations are provided to mitigate factors that interfere with timely recognition and amelioration of canine distress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the risk of BLV transmission through natural suckling. Dams with BLV were classified into three groups (high, middle, low) based on the proviral loads (PVLs). PCR positivity of their colostrum and the correlations between the ratios of calves with BLV and types of feeding milk were analyzed. In dams with low PVLs, no colostrum or calves were confirmed to have BLV. In dams with middle and high PVLs, 17 out of 25 (68.0%) colostrum were PCR positive, and 10 out of 23 (43.4%) and 13 out of 29 (44.8%) calves with natural suckling and artificial rearing were infected with BLV, respectively. No difference was confirmed between the infection rates of natural-suckled and artificially reared calves. Thus, we concluded that the avoidance of natural suckling from dams with BLV and the introduction of artificial rearing were low priority countermeasures against BLV transmission.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822629</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Role of Pathology in the Diagnosis of Swine Respiratory Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>The definition "porcine respiratory disease complex" (PRDC) is used to indicate the current approach for presenting respiratory pathology in modern pig farming. PRDC includes pneumonias with variable pictures, mixed with both aerogenous and hematogenous forms with variable etiology, often multimicrobial, and influenced by environmental and management factors. The notion that many etiological agents of swine respiratory pathology are ubiquitous in the airways is commonly understood; however, their isolation or identification is not always associable with the current pathology. In this complex context, lung lesions registered at slaughterhouse or during necropsy, and supplemented by histological investigations, must be considered as powerful tools for assigning a prominent role to etiologic agents. In recent years, the goal of colocalizing causative agents with the lesions they produce has been frequently applied, and valid examples in routine diagnostics are those that indicate pulmonary involvement during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this purpose, DNA was isolated from 780 blood samples obtained from Greek Holstein cows, 86 from three local breeds of cattle, namely Brachyceros, Katerinis, and Sykias, and 14 from Greek buffalo. The desired region of exon 7 was amplified by PCR, resulting in 121 and 251 bp products in bovine and buffalo samples. The PCR product was digested with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on agarose gels. The restriction enzymes DdeI and TaqI were used. All of the blood samples had the amplified size. The results showed that 74.4% of the Greek Holstein cows had the A2A2 &#946;-casein genotype, the three native breads Vrachykeratiki had 57.7%, and the other two had 100% of the A2A2 &#946;-casein.

The samples were selected if pairs of serum and tongues were available from 2018 to 2020. Serum (pools of five) and exudate from tongues (one bag) were analyzed by PRRSV RT-PCR. The agreement between the serum sample procedure versus tongues exudate was assessed using a concordance test (Kappa statistic) at batch level. A total of 32 submissions, corresponding to 14 farms, had PRRSV diagnostic information for serum and tongues exudate. The overall agreement of batch classification as positive or negative, based on RT-PCR PRRSV results, between serum and tongue exudate of the 32 pairs was 76.9%. Cohen's Kappa was 0.55. The main discrepancy came from the presence of positive samples in tongues exudate and not in serum, suggesting that tongue exudate to monitor PRRSV seems to be more sensitive than serum. These results suggest that this sample procedure could be also used for PRRSV surveillance and monitoring.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

HH compliance in companion animal clinics has been reported to be poor. The present study compared an online application with the WHO evaluation form to assess the WHO five moments of HH in a Swiss companion animal clinic. In 202 hand swabs from 87 staff members, total viable count (TVC) before and after patient contact was evaluated and the swabs were tested for selected antimicrobial resistant microorganisms of public health importance. HH compliance (95% confidence interval) was 36.6% (33.8-39.5%) and was similar when assessed with the two evaluation tools. HH differed between hospital areas (p = 0.0035) and HH indications (p &lt; 0.0001). Gloves were worn in 22.0% (18.0-26.6%) of HH observations and were indicated in 37.2% (27.3-48.3%) of these observations. Mean TVC before patient contact was lower (0.52 log CFU/cm[2]) than after patient contact (1.02 log CFU/cm[2]) but was similar before patient contact on gloved and ungloved hands. Three hand swabs (1.5% (0.4-4.3%)) were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gloving should not be regarded as a substitute for HH.

It is characterized by its aggressive local disease as well as its high rate of lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis. OMM carries a poor prognosis, with most patients succumbing to the disease due to progression of the neoplasm. Histopathologically, OMM is characterized by significant nuclear atypia, a mitotic index of greater than 4/10 hpf, and evidence of vascular invasion or metastasis. Clinically, these lesions can become locally invasive, causing lysis of bones and severe inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue. With time, these lesions can spread to the regional lymph node and to the lungs and other organs. Prognosis can vary depending on the size of the primary tumor, regional node involvement, and distant metastatic disease; however, multiple studies report a relatively short median survival time ranging from less than 4 months to 8 months. Histologically well- differentiated melanocytic neoplasms (HWDMN) are a variant of OMM and sometimes referred to as canine oral melanocytic neoplasms of low malignant potential. Unlike OMM, patients with HWDMN have longer survival times. Histopathologically, HWDMNs have well-differentiated melanocytes with a low mitotic index of 3 or less per 10 hpf and minimal nuclear atypia. HWDMNs have better prognosis with a mean survival time of up to 34 months. This article is a comparative review of OMM and its less aggressive counterpart.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there are not reports on the individualized dosing of LEV for small animals. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a dose adjustment of LEV is needed in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient databases were searched, and 37 dogs with seizures or epilepsy were retrospectively included in this study. Based on pre-existing CKD, patients were divided into a CKD group (n = 20) and a non-CKD group (n = 17). We collected kidney panels before and after LEV treatment. Side-effects were monitored for 1 month after the start of LEV administration. In the CKD group, more dogs developed adverse effects (85%) than in the non-CKD group (52.94%). After LEV administration, an increase in blood urea nitrogen and/or serum creatinine was more often reported in the CKD group than it was in the non-CKD group. Our data indicate that in dogs with seizures or epilepsy with pre-existing CKD, an LEV dose-adjustment is needed. During LEV treatment, CKD patients should be monitored for side-effects and may require laboratory evaluation of renal function.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight circular wounds were analyzed in each dog. The experimental group was treated with HRW thrice daily, while the control group was provided with distilled water (DW). The wound tissues of dogs were examined histopathologically. The fibroblasts, inflammatory cell infiltration, the average number of new blood vessels, and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the skin homogenate of the wound was measured using the corresponding kits. The expressions of Nrf-2, HO-1, NQO-1, VEGF, and PDGF were measured using the real-time fluorescence quantitative method. We observed that HRW wounds showed an increased rate of wound healing, and a faster average healing time compared with DW. Histopathology showed that in the HRW group, the average thickness of the epidermis was significantly lower than the DW group. The average number of blood vessels in the HRW group was higher than the DW group. The MDA levels were higher in the DW group than in the HRW group, but the SOD levels were higher in the HRW group than in the DW group. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression of each gene was significantly different between the two groups. HRW treatment promoted skin wound healing in dogs, accelerated wound epithelization, reduced inflammatory reaction, stimulated the expression of cytokines related to wound healing, and shortened wound healing time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After a literature search, and using PRISMA guidelines principles, a total of 40 swine, 16 bovine and 31 poultry studies were collected concerning mcr-1 gene; five swine, three bovine and three poultry studies referred to mcr-2 gene; eight swine, one bovine, two poultry studies were about mcr-3 gene; six swine, one bovine and one poultry manuscript studied mcr-4 gene; five swine manuscripts studied mcr-5 gene; one swine manuscript was about mcr-6, mcr-7, mcr-8, mcr-9 genes and one poultry study about mcr-10 gene was found. Information about colistin resistance in bacteria derived from animals and animal product foods is still considered limited and that should be continually enhanced; most of the information about clinical isolates are relative to enteropathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. This review demonstrates the widespread dispersion of mcr genes to livestock animals, indicating the need to further increase measures to control this important threat for public health issue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The most effective approach so far for epidemic control is biosecurity, zoning, culling animals exposed, and other relevant measures, which highly demands the cooperation of farmers in epidemic areas. However, an uncooperative phenomenon among individual farmers facing an epidemic has been recorded for a long time and includes unwilling to report the epidemic and selling infected pork. It is important to unravel the determinants of farmers' coping behaviors during an animal epidemic outbreak and use corresponding strategies to reduce farmers' inappropriate behaviors. Taking African Swine Fever (ASF) crisis as an example, this study aimed to reveal the determinants and underlying mechanism of pig farmers' coping behaviors. We adopted qualitative interviews with 45 pig farmers across four endemically infected areas in Hunan provinces, and the data collected were subjected to a grounded theory analysis. Our results showed that emergency response, information sources, and information channels jointly affected pig farmers' epidemic risk perception and their perception of coping behaviors. Meanwhile, both the characteristics of the government and pig farmers moderated this affect. Consequently, by processing information through either a heuristic or an analytical path, pig farmers' behavioral intention was transformed into actual coping behaviors. Our study emphasizes the value of sufficient risk communication, proper compensation policies, and strong public trust in the government for improving the farmers' participation in the epidemic response. Theoretical and practical implications to animal epidemic prevention and control are provided.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we described the prevalence rate of EqPV-CSF and EqCoPV in 133 and 77 serum and fecal samples, respectively, using polymerase chain reaction. Further, we analyzed the potential risk factors for infection. We calculated the nucleotide and amino acid similarity and constructed phylogenetic trees. There was a moderate-to-high prevalence rate (EqPV-CSF: 3.8%; EqCoPV 9.8%) of each virus in serum; moreover, age, country of foaling, and clinical colic signs were significantly associated with the EqPVs infection. The newly identified EqPV-CSF/EqCoPV genomes had high nucleotide and amino acid identities with previously isolated strains in the USA. In phylogenetic analysis, they clustered and formed a new subgroup in the genus Copiparvovirus. To our knowledge, this is the first field epidemiologic study on EqPV-CSF and EqCoPV using both serum and fecal samples. Our findings demonstrate the risk factors for infection and could facilitate the development of disease prevention strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34822642</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Feline Polycystic Kidney Disease: An Update.</Title>	<Abstract>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a disease that affects felines and other mammals, such as humans. The common name is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and causes a progressive development of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney and sometimes in other organs as the liver and pancreas. The formation and growth of cysts progress slowly, causing deterioration of kidney tissue and a gradual decrease in kidney function, leading to irreversible kidney failure. Feline PKD or ADPKD in humans are hereditary pathologies of autosomal dominant transmission. ADPKD is one of the genetic diseases with the highest prevalence in humans. In cats, this disease also has a high prevalence, mainly in the Persian breed, being one of the most common feline genetic diseases. Imaging tests seem to be the most reliable method for diagnosis of the disease, although more genetic tests are being developed to detect the presence of the responsible mutation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about feline PKD to guide future research related to an adequate diagnosis and early detection of causal mutations. It can allow the establishment of selection programs to reduce or eliminate this pathology in feline breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of heat stress in superstimulated Thai-Holstein crossbreds under tropical climate conditions. Data included 75 records from 12 superovulated Thai-Holstein crossbreds between 2018 and 2020. Cows were superstimulated with conventional treatment. The mean temperature-humidity index (THI) was evaluated for three data collection periods: during the 9, 21 and 42-day periods before the insemination day to determine the period in which THI mostly affected superstimulation responses. The THI levels/thresholds were determined and interpreted together with the superovulatory response. A significantly negative correlation was obtained for the THI during the period 9 days before insemination. Negative effects on the number of large follicles and corpora lutea began at a THI of 72 and were apparently severe after a THI of 77, similar to the ovulation rate, fertilized ova and transferable embryos (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, more degenerated embryos were found with THI values (p &lt; 0.05). The superovulatory response in Thai-Holstein crossbreds under tropical climate conditions is highly affected by heat stress starting at a THI of 72 and becomes more severe at a THI higher than 77.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An observational cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey, translated into four languages and disseminated to veterinary affiliates and mailing lists in six countries of Western Continental Europe. Respondents were tasked to share their therapeutic approach to hypoadrenocorticism, whether they preferred DOCP or fludrocortisone and the specific practical use of DOCP. One-hundred and eighty-four responses were included. Of these, 79.9% indicated that they preferred prescribing DOCP over fludrocortisone as a first-line treatment for mineralocorticoid supplementation. A total of 154 respondents had used DOCP at least once. Eighty percent of those who reported their initial dosage prescribed 2.2 mg/kg. After starting DOCP, 68.2% of the respondents assess electrolytes 10 and 25 days after administration following manufacturer instructions. In stable dogs, electrolytes are monitored quarterly, monthly, semi-annually, and annually by 44.2%, 34.4%, 16.9%, and 4.6% of respondents respectively. When treatment adjustment is required, 53% prefer to reduce dosage while 47% increase the interval between doses. Overall, DOCP is the preferred mineralocorticoid supplementation among WEV. Reported variability underlies the need to investigate the best strategies for DOCP use and therapeutic adjustments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This virus is localized in the mitochondria in pigs with PMWS. Here, we identified, for the first time, a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) in the PCV2 capsid protein (Cap) at the N-terminus. PK-15 cells showed colocalization of the MLS-EGFP fusion protein with mitochondria. Since the PCV2 Cap also contained a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that mediated entry into the nucleus, we inferred that the subcellular localization of the PCV2 Cap is inherently complex and dependent on the viral life cycle. Furthermore, we also determined that deletion of the MLS attenuated Cap-induced apoptosis. More importantly, the MLS was essential for PCV2 replication, as absence of the MLS resulted in failure of virus rescue from cells infected with infectious clone DNA. In conclusion, the MLS of the PCV2 Cap plays critical roles in Cap-induced apoptosis, and MLS deletion of Cap is lethal for virus rescue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

IBV is the causative agent of multi-systemic infection in the respiratory, reproductive and renal systems, which is similar to the symptoms of various viral and bacterial diseases reported in chickens. The avian immune system manifests the ability to respond to subsequent exposure with an antigen by stimulating mucosal, humoral and cell-mediated immunity. However, the immune response against IBV presents a dilemma due to the similarities between the different serotypes that infect poultry. Currently, the live attenuated and killed vaccines are applied for the control of IBV infection; however, the continual emergence of IB variants with rapidly evolving genetic variants increases the risk of outbreaks in intensive poultry farms. This review aims to focus on IBV challenge-infection, route and delivery of vaccines and vaccine-induced immune responses to IBV. Various commercial vaccines currently have been developed against IBV protection for accurate evaluation depending on the local situation. This review also highlights and updates the limitations in controlling IBV infection in poultry with issues pertaining to antiviral therapy and good biosecurity practices, which may aid in establishing good biorisk management protocols for its control and which will, in turn, result in a reduction in economic losses attributed to IBV infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of orlistat on metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress parameters in high-fat diet (HFD) induced-MAFLD rats. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6/group), i.e., Normal control (N), HFD, HFD + orlistat (HFD + O) (10 mg/kg/day administered concomitantly for 12 weeks as a protective model), and obese+orlistat (OB + O) (10 mg/kg/day administered 6 weeks after induction of obesity as a therapeutic model) groups. After 12 weeks, the HFD group had significantly increased Lee obesity index, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels, liver total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) together with decreased serum high-density lipoprotein level. Additionally, the HFD group also showed increased Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus with high Keap1 expression and increased liver oxidative stress parameters. Orlistat significantly improved all these alterations in HFD rats. We demonstrated that orlistat might have protective and therapeutic effects against HFD-induced MAFLD rats by its activation on Nrf2 signaling pathway, which subsequently improved metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present retrospective study aims to evaluate the role of ultrasonography and endoscopy in the diagnosis of these conditions. Three hundred and three horses were included and divided into SEA, MEA and MEA + EIPH groups, on the basis of history, clinical examination and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) cytology; scores were assigned to lung ultrasonography, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH), tracheal mucus (TM) and tracheal bifurcation edema (TB). These scores were compared between groups, and their associations with age, BALf cytology, tracheal wash microbiology and between endoscopic and ultrasonographic scores were statistically analyzed. Ultrasonographic scores were higher in the SEA and MEA + EIPH groups and associated with increased BALf neutrophils and hemosiderophages. The PLH score was higher in younger horses affected by MEA and EIPH and associated with increased eosinophils and hemosiderophages. TM and TB scores were greater in older horses affected by SEA, associated with increased neutrophils and inversely correlated with hemosiderophages. Moreover, TM grade was negatively correlated with mast cells. Thoracic ultrasonography and airway endoscopy can provide useful information about the inflammatory status of upper and lower airways in the horse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since vaccines against highly contagious viruses last several days to induce protective immune responses, antiviral strategies for rapid control of outbreak situations are needed. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), an insect virus, has been demonstrated to be an effective vaccine vector for mammals. Besides the ability to display or transduce heterologous antigens, it also induces strong innate immune responses and provides IFN-mediated protection against lethal challenges with viruses like foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in mice. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of AcMNPV to induce IFN production and elicit antiviral activity in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Our results demonstrated that AcMNPV induced an IFN-&#945;-mediated antiviral activity in PBMCs in vitro. Moreover, the inoculation of AcMNPV in piglets led to the production of type I and II IFNs in sera from inoculated animals and antiviral activities against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and FMDV measured by in vitro assays. Finally, it was demonstrated that the pseudotyping of AcMNPV with VSV-G protein, but not the enrichment of the AcMNPV genome with specific immunostimulatory CpG motifs for the porcine TLR9, improved the ability to induce IFN-&#945; production in PBMCs in vitro. Together, these results suggest that AcMNPV is a promising tool for the induction of IFNs in antiviral strategies, with the potential to be biotechnologically improved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

More specifically, 4503 serious alert notifications on food were used to calculate the percent (%) share of various lag phases in an overall fashion (for all EU RASFF Member States collectively examined) as well as for the top-three Member States (in notification numbers), in each one of seven hazard categories. The same procedure was followed for 5236 serious border rejection notifications in each one of five hazard categories on food. The lag phases calculated revealed a state of nonharmonization (in lag phases percent shares) both overall and among the top-three Member States, and in the same MS in various hazard categories in serious alert but less pronounced in serious border rejection notifications. Thus, a "Performance Effectiveness Reporting (PER)-50/30" indicator (over 50% of notifications being notified to the RASFF within 30 days of sampling) was proposed for both types of serious notifications, and its application herein has revealed volatility in performance effectiveness reporting among the top-three EU RASFF Member States in the hazard categories. Actions to harmonize this inconsistency should be pursued in the context of safeguarding public health, aiming at the fastest possible risk management and risk communication of serious contamination incidents on food. Finally, a proposal of an "RASFF country profile" is hereby proposed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The effect of trace elements on the migration of bovine neutrophils is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of copper (Cu; 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/L), zinc (Zn; 1.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/L) and selenium (Se; 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L) on the migration of bovine neutrophils by using a Transwell assay. The results showed that Cu, Zn and Se promoted the number of neutrophils in the trans-mammary epithelium. With the increased concentration of Cu at 1.5 mg/L, the number of neutrophils in the trans-mammary epithelium was increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Zn (5.0 mg/L) and Se (0.1 mg/L) increased the migrated number of neutrophils (p &lt; 0.01) to an extremely significant degree. These findings provided a theoretical and experimental basis for mammary gland immunity in dairy cows. Thus, we suggest that adding moderate amounts of different trace elements can improve the immune function of dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The prevalence of EqPV-H in healthy horses has been reported in the United States, China, Germany, and Austria. The present study determined the prevalence of EqPV-H in the sera of clinically healthy horses in South Korea to identify the potential factors for infection and examine the genetic diversity of EqPV-H DNA sequences through comparison with foreign strains. Serum samples collected from 321 horses were tested for EqPV-H using non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-specific polymerase chain reaction. The associations of EqPV-H infection with sex, age, aspartate aminotransferase and &#947;-glutamyl transferase levels, and race performance were analyzed. Fourteen samples tested positive for EqPV-H (4.4%, 14/321), and EqPV-H infection was associated with sex (p = 0.006) and performance (p = 0.049). In both EqPV-H-positive and control horses, liver-specific biochemical analytes were within the normal ranges. Phylogenetic analyses based on the partial sequences of EqPV-H NS1 revealed that the Korean EqPV-H isolates shared approximately 98.7-100% similarity. Of these, 11 Korean isolates shared high similarity with strains from the United States, Germany, and China, and the remaining three strains were distinct in phylogenetic analyses. The present study describes the current molecular prevalence, potential risk factors, and genetic diversity of Korean EqPV-H.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the U.S., tetracycline antimicrobials are commonly used to treat and control anaplasmosis. Oxytetracycline, administered by injection, is indicated for treatment of clinical anaplasmosis in beef and dairy cattle and calves. Chlortetracycline, administered orally, is indicated for control of active anaplasmosis infection in beef and nonlactating dairy cattle. Tetracyclines have been demonstrated to be effective for treating active anaplasmosis, but their ability to eliminate A. marginale at currently approved therapeutic doses or dosing regimens remains unclear. In the absence of approved dosing regimens for A. marginale clearance, a study was conducted to determine the effect of approved oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline indications on A. marginale bacteremia. Fifteen animals with persistent anaplasmosis were enrolled and divided into three treatment groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received oral chlortetracycline (1.1 mg/kg bodyweight) administered via hand-fed medicated feed for 60 consecutive days. Group 2 (n = 6) received injectable oxytetracycline administered subcutaneously at 19.8 mg/kg bodyweight three times in 3-week intervals. Group 3 (n = 3) served as an untreated control. After 60 days, bacteremia failed to permanently decrease in response to treatment. This result indicates that clearance of A. marginale is unlikely to be reliably achieved using currently approved tetracycline-based regimens to manage anaplasmosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 192 broiler chicks were subject to three dietary treatments, including 0% CABR, 3% and 6% of dry matter. Body weight gains, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, survival rate, and production index (body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, survival rates, and productive index, respectively) were considered for growth performance evaluation. Villi height (&#181;m), crypt depth (&#181;m), and villi: crypt ratio were recorded for the villi histological measurement. The performance did not show a significant effect when compared with the control group during at ages ranging from 1 to 56 days. Villi histology indicate a significant effect on villi height (&#181;m), crypt depth (&#181;m), and villi: crypt of broiler chicks compared with the control group. Also, the use of 3% CABR caused a reduction microbial contamination in chicken fecal matter. In conclusion, supplementation of CABR had no negative effects on growth performance of Thai broiler chicken (KKU 1). Also, the addition of 3% CABR to the feed might help reduce fecal microbial contamination and affect the villi histology of Thai broiler chickens (KKU 1).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As with human mucosal melanoma, the mutational landscape is predominated by copy number aberrations and chromosomal structural variants, but differences in study cohorts and/or tumour heterogeneity can lead to discordant results regarding the nature of specific genes affected. This review discusses somatic molecular alterations in COM that result from single nucleotide variations, copy number changes, chromosomal rearrangements, and/or dysregulation of small non-coding RNAs. A cross-species comparison highlights notable recurrent aberrations, and functionally grouping dysregulated proteins reveals unifying biological pathways that may be critical for oncogenesis and metastasis. Finally, potential therapeutic strategies are considered to target these pathways in canine patients, and the benefits of collaboration between science, medical, and veterinary communities are emphasised.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to investigate the association between on-farm antimicrobial usage and the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of mastitis-causing S. aureus. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 57 S. aureus isolates derived from cows with either clinical or subclinical mastitis from 17 dairy herds in New Zealand. The genetic relatedness between isolates was examined using the core single nucleotide polymorphism alignment whilst AMR and virulence genes were identified in-silico. The association between gene presence-absence and sequence type (ST), antimicrobial susceptibility and dry cow therapy treatment was investigated using Scoary. Altogether, eight STs were identified with 61.4% (35/57) belonging to ST-1. Furthermore, 14 AMR-associated genes and 76 virulence-associated genes were identified, with little genetic diversity between isolates belonging to the same ST. Several genes including merR1 which is thought to play a role in ciprofloxacin-resistance were found to be significantly overrepresented in isolates sampled from herds using ampicillin/cloxacillin dry cow therapy. Overall, the presence of resistance genes remains low and current antimicrobial usage patterns do not appear to be driving AMR in S. aureus associated with bovine mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The failure of the predegenerated nerve graft as a possible therapeutic strategy to improve the locomotion of monkeys may be due to a number of factors set in motion by trauma, which could possibly prevent the qualities of regeneration. The exact reason for this ineffectiveness of predegenerated nerve segments and their underlying mechanism is not known.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941816</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum from Horse Gluteal Muscle Is Poised for Enhanced Calcium Transport.</Title>	<Abstract>We have analyzed the enzymatic activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca[2+]-transporting ATPase (SERCA) from the horse gluteal muscle. Horses are bred for peak athletic performance yet exhibit a high incidence of exertional rhabdomyolysis, with elevated levels of cytosolic Ca[2+] proposed as a correlative linkage. We recently reported an improved protocol for isolating SR vesicles from horse muscle; these horse SR vesicles contain an abundant level of SERCA and only trace-levels of sarcolipin (SLN), the inhibitory peptide subunit of SERCA in mammalian fast-twitch skeletal muscle. Here, we report that the in vitro Ca[2+] transport rate of horse SR vesicles is 2.3 &#177; 0.7-fold greater than rabbit SR vesicles, which express close to equimolar levels of SERCA and SLN. This suggests that horse myofibers exhibit an enhanced SR Ca[2+] transport rate and increased luminal Ca[2+] stores in vivo. Using the densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, we determined that horse SR vesicles express an abundant level of the luminal SR Ca[2+] storage protein calsequestrin (CASQ), with a CASQ-to-SERCA ratio about double that in rabbit SR vesicles. Thus, we propose that SR Ca[2+] cycling in horse myofibers is enhanced by a reduced SLN inhibition of SERCA and by an abundant expression of CASQ. Together, these results suggest that horse muscle contractility and susceptibility to exertional rhabdomyolysis are promoted by enhanced SR Ca[2+] uptake and luminal Ca[2+] storage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The virus was recently brought from South-East Africa to Georgia in 2007, and it has since expanded to Russia, Eastern Europe, China, and Southeast Asia, having a devastating impact on the global swine industry and economy. In this study, we report for the first time the molecular characterization of nine African swine fever virus (ASFV) isolates obtained from domestic pigs in Mure&#351; County, Romania. All nine Romanian samples clustered within p72 genotype II and showed 100% identity with all compared isolates from Georgia, Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. This is the first report of ASFV genotype II in the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941818</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Assessment of Changes in the Oral Microbiome That Occur in Dogs with Periodontal Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>The oral microbiome in dogs is a complex community. Under some circumstances, it contributes to periodontal disease, a prevalent inflammatory disease characterized by a complex interaction between oral microbes and the immune system. Porphyromonas and Tannerella spp. are usually dominant in this disease. How the oral microbiome community is altered in periodontal disease, especially sub-dominant microbial populations is unclear. Moreover, how microbiome functions are altered in this disease has not been studied. In this study, we compared the composition and the predicted functions of the microbiome of the cavity of healthy dogs to those with from periodontal disease. The microbiome of both groups clustered separately, indicating important differences. Periodontal disease resulted in a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and reductions in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Porphyromonas abundance increased 2.7 times in periodontal disease, accompanied by increases in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. It was predicted that aerobic respiratory processes are decreased in periodontal disease. Enrichment in fermentative processes and anaerobic glycolysis were suggestive of an anaerobic environment, also characterized by higher lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. This study contributes to a better understanding of how periodontal disease modifies the oral microbiome and makes a prediction of the metabolic pathways that contribute to the inflammatory process observed in periodontal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One of the recent implementations in the boar studs to improve efficiency has been semi-automatic semen collection systems, which do not allow to discard fractions of the ejaculate. The objective of this work was to evaluate the dilution method and vibrations (simulating delivery transport) effect on sperm quality (motility, viability, morphology, thermo-resistance test) according to the fraction of ejaculate collected. Two different fractions of the ejaculate were obtained [rich fraction (RF); total fractions (TF)] from six boars, and two dilution methods applied [pouring the extender over the semen (control; ES); pouring the semen over the extender (reverse; SE)]. The seminal doses (2000 &#215; 10[6] sperm/50 mL) were preserved for 5 days. The results showed that the fraction collected affects sperm quality (better total and progressive motility, and faster sperm in TF; p &lt; 0.05) regardless of the dilution method applied. However, these differences diminished after submitting the semen to the thermo-resistance test, with only differences in sperm viability being observed (p &lt; 0.05). When seminal doses were subjected to vibrations, the sperm viability was more affected in the TF than in the RF group (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, using the TF ejaculate leads to comparable results to the RF in sperm quality during storage regardless of the dilution method applied. However, the vibrations of seminal doses are more affected in doses prepared with TF than with RF, although more factors should be included to approach the real conditions during transport.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Humans and several animal species are considered as reservoirs of the disease. Among other animal species, dogs are the most important reservoirs in a domestic environment, maintaining the endemic focus of the parasite. The behavior of the disease progression and the clinical symptoms of the disease in the infected dog is mainly associated with depressed cellular immunity and strong humoral response. This study aimed to assess the role of Western blotting in the analysis of the idiotype expression of the two main immunoglobulins (IgG1 and IgG2) in dogs that are naturally infected with Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) and treated with N-methyl meglumine antimoniate. Interestingly, for the first time, our study identified several L. infantum antigen polypeptides (14, 31, 33, 49, 64, 66, 99, and 169 kDa) that more frequently stimulate an immune reaction in recovered dogs after treatment, whereas in the non-recovered group of dogs, four antigen polypeptides of L. infantum with molecular weights of 31, 49, 66, and 115 kDa with unfavorable prognosis were identified. Clearly, these interesting findings confirm the strong association between the detected immunodominant bands and the successful recovery in treated dogs that can be used for differentiating the treated dogs from the untreated dogs, as well as the markers of a favorable or unfavorable prognosis and, as a consequence, the prediction of the clinical outcome of the disease. Likewise, these data could be helpful in the implementation of novel vaccines from the detected antigens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sixteen crossbred steers (Charolais x American Brahman) at 375 &#177; 25 kg live weight were divided into four groups that received DY supplementation at 0, 5, 10, and 15 g/hd/d using a completely randomized block design. Basal diets were fed as a total mixed ration (roughage to concentrate ratio of 30:70). Results showed that supplementation with DY improved dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (p &lt; 0.05), but DM and crude protein (CP) were similar among treatments (p &gt; 0.05). Ruminal pH (&gt;6.0) of fattening steer remained stable (p &gt; 0.05), and pH was maintained at or above 6.0 with DY. The concentration of propionic acid (C3) increased (p &lt; 0.05) with 10 and 15 g/hd/d DY supplementation, while acetic acid (C2) and butyric acid (C4) decreased. Methane (CH4) production in the rumen decreased as DY increased (p &lt; 0.05). Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens populations increased (p &lt; 0.05), whereas protozoal and methanogen populations decreased with DY addition at 10 and 15 g/hd/d, while Ruminococcus albus did not change (p &gt; 0.05) among the treatments. Adding DY at 10 and 15 g/hd/d improved growth performance. Thus, the addition of DY to fattening steers with a high concentrate diet improved feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen ecology, and growth performance, while mitigating ruminal methane production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We studied 156 peritoneal fluid samples from cows presenting PFP after caesarean section. Bacteria were cultured in selective media and their antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion assay. Bacteria were isolated in the majority (129/156; 83%) of samples. The majority (82/129; 63%) of positive samples contained one dominant species, while two or more species were cultured in 47/129 (36%) samples. Trueperella pyogenes (T. Pyogenes) (107 strains) was the most identified species, followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli) (38 strains), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (6 strains), and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) (6 strains). Several other species were sporadically identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested in 59/185 strains, predominantly E. coli (38 strains) and P. mirabilis (6 strains). Antibiotic resistance, including resistance to molecules of critical importance, was commonly observed; strains were classified as weakly drug resistant (22/59; 37%), multidrug resistant (24/59; 41%), extensively drug resistant (12/59; 20%), or pan-drug resistant (1/59; 2%). In conclusion, extensive antibiotic resistance in the isolated germs might contribute to treatment failure. Ideally, antimicrobial therapy of PFP should be based upon bacterial culture and susceptibility testing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Herein, we describe the occurrence of PrV infection in a hunting dog that had been bitten by an infected wild boar in Sicily, reporting for the first time genetic and phylogenetic data on the virus strain isolated in a dog in this Italian region. The dog was referred for severe neurological signs, respiratory distress, and intense itch around the muzzle. Death occurred within 48 h to the onset of clinical signs. On gross examination, self-induced skin lesions to the head due to intense itching and diffuse cerebral congestion were observed, whereas mild, aspecific, nonsuppurative meningitis was histologically diagnosed. Diffuse PrV positivity in neurons of the brainstem was observed by immunohistochemistry. PrV DNA was isolated and amplified from olfactory bulbs by nested PCR, targeting the viral glycoprotein G gene, and the sequence obtained matched with sequences of PrV isolates from dogs and wild boar. Isolation of PrV in the dog herein analysed denotes the spread of the virus in wild boar populations in Sicily and provides a proof of direct interspecies transmission. Thus, there is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the epidemiology of the PrV infection in wildlife to provide tools to trace possible spill over into domestic pigs or other livestock.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Milk somatic cells count (SCC, cells/mL) comprises different white blood cells fractions and is worldwide used to monitor and genetically improve udder health. Nevertheless, only certain SCC fractions increase when an udder inflammation occurs. Considering that antibiotic use for preventive purposes will be forbidden in 2022, we compared two different dry therapy protocols, blanket (BDCT) and selective (SDCT), on different SCC fractions in healthy quarters milk. Multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and SCC, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and differential somatic cell count (DSCC) recorded after the experimental drying off were available. Significant differences were observed between the two protocols, with more favorable parameters in BDCT than SDCT cows. Results showed that moving from BDCT to SDCT is expected to significantly increase some SCC fractions, such as PMN, in healthy quarters. The baseline SCC level at the onset of lactation was greater in cows under SDCT than BDCT. Although not significant, clinical mastitis prevalence was numerically lower in BDCT (7.32%) than SDCT (8.62%). In this study we referred to a limited number of cows, but still findings will be useful to improve the knowledge on the impact of SDCT on milk SCC fractions in healthy quarters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941825</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic Effect and Growth Curve Parameter Estimation under Heat Stress in Slow-Growing Thai Native Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Heat stress is becoming a major problem because it limits growth in poultry production, especially in tropical areas. The development of genetic lines of Thai native chickens (TNC) which can tolerate the tropical climate with the least compromise on growth performance is therefore necessary. This research aims to analyze the appropriate growth curve function and to estimate the effect of heat stress on the genetic absolute growth rate (AGR) in TNC and Thai synthetic chickens (TSC). The data comprised 35,355 records for body weight from hatching to slaughtering weight of 7241 TNC and 10,220 records of 2022 TSC. The best-fitting growth curve was investigated from three nonlinear regression models (von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and logistic) and used to analyze the individual AGR. In addition, a repeatability test-day model on the temperature-humidity index (THI) function was used to estimate the genetic parameters for heat stress. The Gompertz function produced the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) and highest the pseudo-coefficient of determination (Pseudo-R[2]) in both chicken breeds. The growth rates in TSC were higher than TNC; the growth rates of males were greater than females, but the age at inflection point in females was lower than in males in both chicken breeds. The THI threshold started at 76. The heritability of the AGR was 0.23 and 0.18 in TNC and TSC, respectively. The additive variance and permanent environmental variance of the heat stress effect increased sharply after the THI of 76. The growth rate decreased more severely in TSC than TNC. In conclusion, the Gompertz function can be applied with the THI to evaluate genetic performance for heat tolerance and increase growth performance in slow-growing chicken.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is a need for novel insights to improve current rabies control strategies in these countries. Network analysis is commonly used to study the interactions between individuals or organizations and has been applied in preventive veterinary medicine. However, contact networks of domestic free-roaming dogs are mostly unexplored. The objective of this study was to explore the contact network of free-roaming dogs residing on a university campus. Three one-mode networks were created using co-appearances of dogs as edges. A two-mode network was created by associating the dog with the pre-defined area it was seen in. The average number of contacts a dog had was 6.74. The normalized degree for the weekend network was significantly higher compared to the weekday network. All one-mode networks displayed small-world network characteristics. Most dogs were observed in only one area. The average number of dogs which shared an area was 8.67. In this study, we demonstrated the potential of observational methods to create networks of contacts. The network information acquired can be further used in network modeling and designing targeted disease control programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, several studies have reported significant variation between breeds. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the VHS and to suggest a useful upper limit for normal heart size in Brittany Spaniels. The VHS was measured using a right lateral view in twenty-eight normal dogs and fifteen dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. The mean &#177; SD (standard deviation) VHS was 10.6 &#177; 0.2 vertebrae (v) in the normal dogs, which differs significantly from the mean VHS of 9.7 &#177; 0.5 v in Buchanan's original study with dogs of various breeds. The VHS in the dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease was 11.9 &#177; 1.1 v.

Accurate prediction of clinical outcome and survival following the treatment can support and expedite the process of comparing alternative treatments. We describe the methodology to dynamically determine remission probabilities for individual patients, as well as their prospects of progression-free survival (PFS). The proposed methodology utilizes the ex vivo drug sensitivity of cancer cells, their immunophenotyping results, and patient information, such as age and breed, in training machine learning (ML) models, as well as the Cox hazards model to predict the probability of clinical remission (CR) or relapse across time for a given patient. We applied the methodology using the three types of data obtained from 242 canine lymphoma patients treated by (L)-CHOP chemotherapy. The results demonstrate substantial enhancement in the predictive accuracy of the ML models by utilizing features from all the three types of data. They also highlight superior performance and utility in predicting survival compared to the conventional stratification method. We believe that the proposed methodology can contribute to improving and personalizing the care of cancer patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941829</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Addition of Reduced Glutathione (GSH) to Freezing Medium Reduces Intracellular ROS Levels in Donkey Sperm.</Title>	<Abstract>In donkeys, the use of frozen-thawed sperm for artificial insemination (AI) leads to low fertility rates. Furthermore, donkey sperm produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and post-AI inflammation induces the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which further generates many more ROS. These high ROS levels may induce lipid peroxidation in the sperm plasma membrane, thus affecting its integrity. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly found in the seminal plasma (SP), are responsible for maintaining the redox balance. However, this fluid is removed prior to cryopreservation, thereby exposing sperm cells to further oxidative stress. The exogenous addition of antioxidants to the freezing medium can reduce the detrimental effects caused by ROS generation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate how the addition of different reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations (control, 2 mM, 4 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, and 10 mM) to fresh sperm affect their cryotolerance. Total and progressive motility, kinematic parameters and motile sperm subpopulations were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different from the control in treatments containing 8 mM and 10 mM GSH, but not at lower concentrations. Plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and intracellular superoxide levels (O2[-]) were not affected (p &gt; 0.05) by any GSH concentration. Interestingly, however, the addition of 8 mM or 10 mM GSH reduced (p &lt; 0.05) the percentages of viable sperm with high overall ROS levels compared to the control. In conclusion, frozen-thawed donkey sperm are able to tolerate high GSH concentrations, which differs from what has been observed in other species. This antioxidant capacity suggests that ROS could be important during post-AI and that the impact of using exogenous antioxidants like GSH to improve the sperm resilience to freeze-thawing is limited in this species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After determination of leptospiral infection by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), urine from MAT-positive dogs were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (lipL32 rt-PCR) and then isolated by culture. In order to characterize obtained serovars, positive cultures were then subjected to 16S rRNA and secY sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). Results showed that seven dogs (4%; 95% CI: 0-55) had Leptospira DNAs in their urine and five strains were isolated from urine cultures. The three different sequence types (ST17, ST198 and ST24) belonging to Leptospira interrogans genomospecies identified by MLST analyses in this study, confirmed that the leptospiral infection was widespread in Sardinian dogs. We also reported the first characterization of a new Leptospira spp. isolated from urine of one dog living in the study area. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed that this genospecies was closely related to Leptospira hovindhougenii, an intermediate Leptospira spp. with unknown pathogenicity previously isolated from a rat in Denmark. Further studies are required to clarify whether healthy dogs that shed leptospires in their urine could represent a zoonotic risk for humans in this region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, chrysin-loaded polymeric micelles (CPs) were developed and investigated for the masculinizing effects, survival rate, growth indices, and toxicity on Siamese fighting fish. CPs were prepared using a poloxamer. The micelle system of CPs that were formed at a chrysin-to-polymer ratio of 1:2 was found to be the most suitable monodispersed system and exhibited a nanosized diameter (74.2 &#177; 1.6 nm) with a narrow size distribution (0.288 &#177; 0.012). In vivo studies were performed using Siamese fighting fish larvae as animal models. In the in vivo toxicity study, the fish larvae were immersed in aqueous systems containing CPs that had five different chrysin concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 ng/mL for 24, 48, and 72 h. Blank polymeric micelles and water were used as controls. The in vivo masculinization effect of CPs with different chrysin concentrations on the fish larvae was evaluated after 5 weeks of exposure. The results demonstrated that CPs with a chrysin concentration of 1000 ng/mL showed a masculinization effect of 94.59 &#177; 2.76% with a high fish larvae survival rate of 72.45 &#177; 5.09% and low toxicity. It was concluded that the developed CPs had a significant effect on the sex reversal of Siamese fighting fish larvae with a high survival rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The tumor cells exhibited heterogeneous protein expression, including a positive expression of vimentin, cytokeratin, RANKL, CRLR, SOX9, and collagen 2, and was diagnosed as extraskeletal osteosarcoma. Despite its malignancy, the dog showed no sign of recurrence or metastasis three months after the resection. Further analysis of the tumor cells revealed a high expression of proliferation- and metastasis-related biomarkers in the absence of angiogenesis-related biomarkers, suggesting that the lack of angiogenesis and the elevated tumor-associated fibrosis resulted in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment and prevented metastasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

E. coli was isolated in 70/160 samples (44%), while Staphylococcus spp. were isolated in 110/160 (69%) samples. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates from CA and ICU admission were similar for E. coli (1/12 (8%) versus 4/27 (15%), respectively) and Staphylococcus spp. (10/19 (53%) versus 26/50 (52%), respectively). MDR E. coli isolates increased significantly at hospital discharge (18/31; 58%; p = 0.008). Antimicrobial treatment administered during hospitalization was a risk factor for carriage of MDR E. coli (OR, 23.9; 95% CI: 1.18-484.19; p = 0.04) and MDR Staphylococcus spp. (OR, 19.5; 95% CI 1.30-292.76; p = 0.02), respectively. The odds ratio for MDR E. coli was 41.4 (95% CI 2.13-806.03; p = 0.01), if the administration of fluoroquinolones was evaluated. The mecA gene was detected in 19/24 (79%) coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. isolates resistant to oxacillin. High rates of MDR Staphylococcus spp. were reported. Hospitalization in the ICU and antimicrobial treatment were risk factors for colonization by MDR commensal bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941836</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Infrared Thermography Evaluation of Feet Temperature and Its Association with Claw Lengths and Anisodactylia in Purebred Sows of Three Greek Herds.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of the study was to investigate the associations of lower feet temperature with claw lengths measurements in purebred sows. In total 22, 19 and 45 multiparous sows in three herds A, B and C of PIC, DANBRED and TOPIGS genetic lines respectively participated in the study. Mean parity was 2.5, 2.3 and 3.0 for sows from herds A, B and C respectively. Measurements were made during the periparturient period. Infrared temperature distribution was measured in carpus/tarsus, upper-lower metacarpi/metatarsi and phalanges (IRT1, IRT2, IRT3 and IRT4 respectively). In addition, dorsal, diagonal, heel-sole and dew claw lengths of medial and lateral claw were measured and the difference in dorsal claw length between medial and lateral claw (anisodactylia) was calculated in all four feet. Differences between herds regarding IRT and claw length measurements were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with herds as a fixed factor. Correlations between IRT and claw length measurements in each foot including data from all herds were evaluated using the Pearson's correlation test. Maximum IRT1 to 4 in almost all rear feet, differed significantly between herds, being lower in sows of herd C than A and B (p &lt; 0.05). Claw lengths of all feet were lower in herd C than those of A and B (p &lt; 0.05). Anisodactylia, differed significantly only in rear feet between herds been higher in herd A than C and B (p &lt; 0.05). In all sows, claw lengths and rear feet anisodactylia were positively correlated with maximum IRT1 to IRT4 (p &lt; 0.05). According to the results, IRT temperature distribution of lower feet of purebred sows of different genetic lines were positive correlated with claw lengths measurements and anisodactylia. Collectively, measuring IRT temperature of lower feet of sows with mobile IRT device could be used as an additional tool towards monitoring feet and claw health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To detect E. canis-specific antibodies and investigate the E. canis TRP genotypes in cats, serum samples from 76 domestic cats reactive to crude E. canis antigens by the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) were analyzed by ELISA, using E. canis-specific peptides (i.e., TRP19 and TRP36 /BR/US/CR). Of these, 25 (32.9%) cats reacted to at least one TRP peptide, confirming their specific exposure to E. canis. Eighteen (23.7%) cats reacted to TRP19, 15 (19.8%) to BRTRP36, and 11 (14.5%) to USTRP36, but none of them reacted to CRTRP36. Eight (10.5%) cats reacted to TRP19 but not to any TRP36 genotype, demonstrating the possible existence of a new E. canis genotype infecting felines. Nevertheless, this study provides the first report of anti-E. canis-specific antibodies in domestic cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to detect the changes in APPs in plasma during the periparturient period of healthy dairy goats. Guanzhong dairy goats with no other symptoms (n = 15) were selected on the basis of their blood calcium (Ca) and &#946;-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration. The plasma was collected once a week for &#177;3 weeks delivery. The concentrations of the four APPs mentioned above were determined using goat-specific ELISA kits. The results showed the CRP level in plasma decreased from 3 weeks to 1 week antepartum and increased later until 1 week postpartum and then decreased to a similar level with antepartum between 1 and 3 weeks postpartum. The content of CP showed a decline in 3 weeks before parturition and an upward trend between 1 week antepartum and 3 weeks postpartum. The SAA concentration decreased from 3 weeks antepartum to 2 weeks postpartum and rebounded later. The level of HP decreased during 3 weeks before parturition and increased until 1 week postpartum, then reached a stable value. Clear variation range and rules of APPs contribute to perinatal health monitoring of dairy goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Canine anaplasmosis is an important worldwide disease, mainly caused by Anaplasma platys and A. phagocytophilum with zoonotic implications. A. platys chiefly infects platelets in canids, while A. phagocytophilum is the most common zoonotic pathogen infecting neutrophils of various vertebrate hosts. Diagnosis is based on the identification of clinical signs, the recognition of intracellular inclusions observed by microscopic observation of stained blood smear, and/or methods detecting antibodies or nucleic acids, although DNA sequencing is usually required to confirm the pathogenic strain. Serological cross-reactivity is the main problem in serodiagnosis. Prevalence varies from area to area depending on tick exposure. Tetracyclines are significant drugs for human and animal anaplasmosis. No universal vaccine is yet available that protects against diverse geographic strains. The control of canine anaplasmosis therefore relies on the detection of vectors/reservoirs, control of tick vectors, and prevention of iatrogenic/mechanical transmission. The control strategies for human anaplasmosis include reducing high-risk tick contact activities (such as gardening and hiking), careful blood transfusion, by passing immunosuppression, recognizing, and control of reservoirs/vectors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941840</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Clinical Guiding Role of the Distribution of Corneal Nerves in the Selection of Incision for Penetrating Corneal Surgery in Canines.</Title>	<Abstract>The cornea is one of the regions with the highest density of nerve terminals in the animal body and it bears such functions as nourishing the cornea and maintaining corneal sensation. In veterinary clinical practice, the corneoscleral limbus incision is frequently applied in cataract surgery, peripheral iridectomy, and other procedures for glaucoma. Inevitably, it would cause damage to the nerve roots that enter the cornea from the corneal limbus, thus inducing a series of complications. In this paper, the in vitro cornea (39 corneas from 23 canines, with ages ranging from 8 months old to 3 years old, including 12 male canines and 11 female canines) was divided into 6 zones, and the whole cornea was stained with gold chloride. After staining, corneal nerves formed neural networks at different levels of cornea. There was no significant difference in the number of nerve roots at the corneoscleral limbus between different zones (F = 1.983, p = 0.082), and the nerve roots at the corneoscleral limbus (mean value, 24.43; 95% CI, 23.43-25.42) were evenly distributed. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the number of corneal nerve roots between male and female canines (p = 0.143). There was also no significant difference in the number of corneal nerve roots between adult canines and puppies (p = 0.324). The results of the above analysis will provide a reasonable anatomical basis for selecting the incision location and orientation of penetrating surgery for the canine cornea in veterinary practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The histopathologic assessment of percent global glomerulosclerosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrosis was performed. Senescence and nitrosative stress were evaluated utilizing p16 and iNOS immunohistochemistry, respectively. Renal telomere length was evaluated using telomere fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry. CKD cats were found to have significantly increased p16 staining in both the renal cortex and corticomedullary junction compared to adult and senior cats. Senior cats had significantly increased p16 staining in the corticomedullary junction compared to adult cats. p16 staining in both the renal cortex and corticomedullary junction were found to be significantly correlated with percent global glomerulosclerosis, cortical inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrosis scores. p16 staining also correlated with age in non-CKD cats. Average telomere length was significantly decreased in CKD cats compared to adult and senior cats. CKD cats had significantly increased iNOS staining compared to adult cats. Our results demonstrate increased renal senescence, telomere shortening, and nitrosative stress in feline CKD, identifying these patients as potential candidates for senolytic therapy with translational potential.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A farm survey was conducted to provide a baseline assessment of poultry production (products generated, farm costs, and revenue), pharmaceutical use, and related challenges faced by farmers on 44 commercial poultry farms in Oyo and Kano states of Nigeria. Live spent layers, eggs, and used beddings were the most frequently sold products for revenue. Antibiotic products were widely used, the most reported were Doxygen, Tylosin, and Conflox. Overall, 40% of farms used feed additives (including toxin binders, minerals, and vitamins) and 12% used coccidiostats. Access to pharmaceutical products was a key challenge and appeared to disproportionally affect farmers in the northern part (Kano) of Nigeria. Other challenges included perceived antibiotic ineffectiveness, high cost of drugs, and long distances to pharmaceutical suppliers. Challenges related to vaccine use were unavailability, distance to the supplier, and health issues interfering with the vaccination schedule. Study findings highlight the need for improved access to veterinary pharmaceuticals, particularly in the northern states. Further investigations into the causes of antibiotic ineffectiveness and strategies for distribution of high-quality, effective pharmaceuticals are also necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of WNT6 on Hu sheep endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and uterine glands (UGs) in Hu sheep, with high prolificacy rates. In the present study, Hu sheep with different fecundity, over three consecutive pregnancies, were divided into two groups: high prolificacy rate group (HP, litter size = 3) and low prolificacy rate group (LP, litter size = 1). A comparative analysis of the endometrial morphology was performed by immunofluorescence. RNA-seq was used to analyze the gene's expression in endometrium of HP and LP Hu sheep, providing a candidate gene, which was investigated in EECs and organoid culture. Firstly, higher density of UGs was found in the HP Hu sheep groups (p &lt; 0.05). The RNA-seq data revealed the importance of the WNT signaling pathway and WNT6 gene in Hu sheep endometrium. Functionally, WNT6 could promote the cell cycle progression of EECs via WNT/&#946;-catenin signal and enhance UGs organogenesis. Taken together, WNT6 is a crucial regulator for sheep endometrial development; this finding may offer a new insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism of sheep prolificacy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study is to describe a case of cutaneous non epitheliotropic B-cell lymphoma (CNEBL) with plasmablastic differentiation vs. multiple cutaneous plasmacytosis (CP) in a dog, since the scarce bibliographic data on these topics. A 12-year-old male Beagle dog was presented for multiple, nodular, cutaneous, and subcutaneous, indolent masses disseminated on the whole body. Cytological, histological, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical examinations, as well as complete radiographic evaluation, echocardiography, and abdominal ultrasound were performed. Cytology, histopathology, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical examination, performed on the skin lesions, revealed a B-cell phenotype with plasmablastic differentiation. Nevertheless, a final diagnosis could not be achieved and it was categorized as a case of borderline CNEBL with plasmablastic differentiation versus CP. The dog was treated with a COP chemotherapeutic protocol. Total remission was obtained and relapse occurred 120 days later. To our knowledge, specific markers are actually unavailable to certainly differentiate CNEBL and CP in the dog and future studies are needed to improve knowledge on these pathologies in veterinary medicine, since prognosis and therapy are different.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Congenital heart diseases as a ventricular septal defect can facilitate bacterial endocarditis as a consequence of turbulent blood flow through the defect, causing damage to the endocardium. We describe a case of mural endocarditis associated with a ventricular septal defect in an eight-year-old female Holstein Friesian cow. The cow's history revealed that she had presented dysorexia and a sudden decrease of milk production in the last 10 days prior to the examination. On clinical examination, jugular pulses, tachycardia with irregular heart rate and tachypnea with harsh bronchovesicular sounds were evident. Electrocardiographic examination allowed the diagnosis of an atrial fibrillation with high ventricular response rate. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large vegetation originating from the endocardium between the tricuspid and pulmonic valves in the right ventricle outflow. On post-mortem examination, a small muscular septal defect under the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve and a mural vegetative endocarditis were found. An abscess in the chondro-costal junction of the third right rib and metastatic pneumonia were also observed. This case report describes a rare consequence of a small ventricular septal defect that had not been previously diagnosed in an adult cow.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941846</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Therapeutic Effect of Darkling Beetle (Zophobas morio) Hemolymph on Skin Thermal Injury in Mice Infected by Staphylococcus haemolyticus.</Title>	<Abstract>Staphylococci are the most common pathogens isolated from skin infections in livestock or companion animals. Antibiotic therapy is the best treatment for infections, but local or systemic use of antimicrobials increases the risk of bacterial resistance. Insects are rich in antimicrobial peptides, which can reduce bacterial resistance and can be used to treat bacterial infections after skin burns. We propose that the use of the darkling beetle (Z. morio) hemolymph to treat skin infections in mice by Staphylococcus haemolyticus is one of the alternatives. Z. morio hemolymph alleviated the increase in wound area temperature in mice with a skin infection, reduced the bacterial load of the wound, and accelerated the wound healing speed significantly. Pathological sections showed that Z. morio hemolymph can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration, and promote skin tissue repair. Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that the Z. morio hemolymph can significantly reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#946;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), and chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Our findings suggest that Z. morio antibacterial hemolymph can promote wound contraction, relieve local inflammatory responses and promote wound healing in mice infected with a heat injury, which has a positive therapeutic effect and enormous potential for skin thermal injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The tree yields an oleoresin which is extensively used in local traditional medicine mainly as an anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive agent. The aim of the present study was to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of this oleoresin obtained from a national forest in the central Amazon which presented an unusual chemical composition. The chemical composition of volatile compounds of oleoresin was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The acute toxicity assay was performed with a single dose of 2000 mg/kg. The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated by carrageenan-induced paw edema and air pouch assays using four different C. reticulata oleoresin concentrations (10, 100, and 400 mg/kg). The exudate was evaluated for nitrite concentration through the colorimetric method and for TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and PGE2 by ELISA. C. reticulata oleoresin collected in the Amazonian summer contained six major sesquiterpene compounds (&#946;-bisabolene, cis-eudesma-6,11-diene, trans-&#945;-bergamotene, &#946;-selinene, &#945;-selinene, and &#946;-elemene) and was nontoxic at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, showing low acute toxicity. Different from oleoresin obtained from other sites of the Brazilian Amazon, the major volatile compound found was &#946;-Bisabolene with 25.15%. This &#946;-Bisabolene-rich oleoresin reduced the formation of paw edema induced by carrageenan and reduced the global number of cells in the air pouch assay, as well as exudate volume and nitrite, TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and prostaglandin E2 levels (p &lt; 0.05). C. reticulata oleoresin with a high &#946;-Bisabolene concentration showed anti-inflammatory activity, reducing vascular permeability and consequently edema formation, and thus reducing cell migration and the production of inflammatory cytokine, confirming its traditional use by local Amazonian communities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we developed transient ischemia in the forebrain of the gerbil and found cognitive impairment using the Barnes maze test and passive avoidance test for spatial memory and learning memory, respectively. In addition, neuronal loss/death was detected in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the gerbil hippocampus after the ischemia by cresyl violet histochemistry, immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei and histofluorescence with Fluoro-Jade B. Furthermore, in the CA1 region following ischemia, myelin and vesicular synaptic density were significantly decreased using immunohistochemistry for myelin basic protein and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. In the gerbils, treatment with COG-up[&#174;] (a combined extract of Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. and Brassica oleracea Var.), which was rich in scutellarin and sinapic acid, after the ischemia, significantly improved ischemia-induced decline in memory function when compared with that shown in gerbils treated with vehicle after the ischemia. In the CA1 region of these gerbils, COG-up[&#174;] treatment significantly promoted the remyelination visualized using immunohistochemistry myelin basic protein, increased oligodendrocytes visualized using a receptor-interacting protein, and restored the density of glutamatergic synapses visualized using double immunofluorescence for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and microtubule-associated protein, although COG-up[&#174;] treatment did not protect pyramidal cells (principal neurons) located in the CA1 region form the ischemic insult. Considering the current findings, a gerbil model of ischemic stroke apparently showed cognitive impairment accompanied by ischemic injury in the hippocampus; also, COG-up[&#174;] can be employed for improving cognitive decline following ischemia-reperfusion injury in brains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or selenium (Se) in mineral salt block (MSB) supplementation on ruminal pH, rumen fermentation, milk yield and composition in Holstein Friesian crossbred dairy cows. Four crossbred dairy cows with an initial weight of 456 &#177; 6 kg in mid-lactation were assigned at random using a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design. The experiments were divided into four periods, each lasting 21 days. Each cow was fed a basal diet supplemented with a different type of mineral salt block: a control with no MSB supplementation, and MSB groups with MSB containing NaHCO3 (MSB-Na), MSB containing Se (MSB-Se), and conventional commercial MSB (MSB-Com). MSB-Na contained NaHCO3 (500 g/kg) to prevent acidosis, MSB-Se contained organic Se (15 mg/kg) as an antioxidant, and MSB-Com was a positive control mineral salt block. The results show that there was no significant difference in feed intake between treatments, but there was a significant difference in mineral salt intake between treatments (p &lt; 0.05). Supplementing mineral blocks had no effect on nutrient intake or apparent digestibility (p &gt; 0.05). Ruminal pH was not different between treatments at 0 and 1 h post-feeding, but at 2 and 4 h post-feeding, ruminal pH in cows fed MSB-Na and MSB-Se was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than it was in cows fed MSB-Com and the control. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA), acetic, propionic, butyric, and ammonia nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen were not influenced by mineral blocks supplementation. Milk yield, milk composition and energy-corrected milk (ECM) were not affected by supplementing mineral blocks. However, compared with the control, the somatic cell count (SCC) in the milk was reduced (p &lt; 0.05) by supplementation with the mineral salt block. Based on the results of the experiments, it was concluded that MSB-Na or MSB-Se supplementation improved ruminal pH while having no effect on feed intake, rumen fermentation, milk yield, or composition, though it did reduce SCC in milk. However, additional research should be conducted to investigate the effect of MSB on rumen ecology and milk production in dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is important to routinely survey these animals for helminth infections to allow effective management and control programs to be implemented. A cross-sectional helminth survey carried out in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, revealed the infection rate of gastrointestinal helminths in cattle (n = 157) and goats (n = 117) to be 35.7% and 88%, respectively, by microscopic fecal examination, and a 100% herd prevalence was observed in goats. Eggs of strongyle nematodes, Strongyloides spp., Trichuris spp., Capillaria spp., Paramphistomum spp., and Moniezia spp. were detected, with a relatively high rate of strongyle nematode infection in both cattle (28.7%) and goats (86.3%). Mixed infections were observed in 14.3% and 35.9% of egg-positive samples from cattle and goats, respectively. Risk factor analysis showed that dairy cattle were 5.1 times more likely to be infected with strongyles than meat cattle. In contrast, meat goats were 9.3 times more likely to be infected with strongyles than dairy goats. The inverse findings in cattle and goats are discussed. Female gender was associated with a higher risk of strongyle infection in goats. DNA sequencing and in-house semi-nested PCR with primers specific to a region in the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) were successfully used to identify strongyle genera in randomly selected egg-positive cattle (n = 24) and goat (n = 24) samples. Four strongyle genera, i.e., Cooperia spp., Haemonchus spp., Oesophagostomum spp., and Trichostrongylus spp. were identified by DNA sequencing. By semi-nested PCR, Cooperia spp. were detected as a major parasite of cattle (70.8%), whereas Haemonchus spp. were abundant in goats (100%). The majority of samples from cattle (58.3%) and goats (95.8%) were found to coinfect with at least two strongyle genera, suggesting that coinfection with multiple strongyle genera was more common than single infection in these animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To protect the cells from oxidative damage, the Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) degraded the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxygen (O2) and water. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of SOD1 silencing on intracellular ROS accumulation, cell viability, MMP, hormone synthesis (P4, E2), cell proliferation, and apoptosis in GCs under HS. The mechanistic role of SOD1 regulation in the heat-stressed GCs was explored. SOD1 gene was successfully silenced in GCs and confirmed at both transcriptional and translational levels. We found that silencing of SOD1 using siRNA under HS aggravated intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), altered transition of the cell cycle, and impaired synthesis of progesterone (P4) and estrogen (E2) in GCs. The associative apoptotic, steroidogenic, and cell cycle genes (BAX, Caspase-3, STAR, Cyp11A1, HSP70, PCNA, and CyclinB1) were used to confirm the results. These results identify a novel role of SOD1 in the modulation of bovine ovarian GC apoptosis, which provides a target for improving the fertility of heat-stressed dairy cows in summer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

No abnormalities were detected upon physical examination. Subsequently, the dog went for a walk under the direct supervision of one of the authors, became overexcited and, after approximately five minutes, bloody liquid, with a patchy distribution, appeared along the hair shafts of the face and neck. The affected skin was congested, partially blanching on diascopy and bloody liquid was oozing from the follicular openings. Urticaria, dermographism and hypertension were excluded, the complete blood count and coagulation profile were within the reference ranges and an analysis of the bloody exudate confirmed its blood components. The cutaneous bleeding of the dog followed a self-limited course, with no episodes during the last two years. Clinical and laboratory findings and the long-term evolution of this dog bear striking similarities to haematidrosis, a rare human disease of multifactorial aetiology and equivocal pathogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of Mutian X in cats with FIP must be explored, although the predictors of therapeutic success remain unknown. In the present study, we administered Mutian X to 141 pet cats with effusive FIP following initial veterinarian examinations. Of these, 116 cats survived but the remaining 25 died during treatment. Pre-treatment signalment, viral gene expression, and representative laboratory parameters for routine FIP diagnosis (i.e., hematocrit, albumin-to-globulin ratio, total bilirubin, serum amyloid-A, and &#945;1-acid glycoprotein) were statistically compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. The majority of these parameters, including hematocrit, albumin-to-globulin ratio, serum amyloid-A, &#945;1-acid glycoprotein, and viral gene expression, were comparable between the two groups. Interestingly, however, total bilirubin levels in the survivor group were significantly lower than those in the non-survivor group (p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, in almost all surviving cats with effusive FIP (96.6%, 28/29), the pre-treatment total bilirubin levels were below 0.5 mg/dL; however, the survival rate decreased drastically (14.3%, 1/7) when the pre-treatment total bilirubin levels exceeded 4.0 mg/dL. Thus, circulating total bilirubin levels may act as a prognostic risk factor for severe FIP and may serve as the predictor of the therapeutic efficacy of Mutian X against this fatal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34941856</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic Diversity and Population Structure for Resistance and Susceptibility to Mastitis in Braunvieh Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Mastitis is a disease that causes significant economic losses, since resistance to mastitis is a difficult trait to be improved due to its multifactorial occurrence. Therefore, our objective was to characterize a Mexican Braunvieh cattle population for genetic resistance and susceptibility to mastitis. We used 66 SNP markers for 45 candidate genes in 150 animals. The average heterozygosity was 0.445 &#177; 0.076, a value higher than those reported for some European breeds. The inbreeding coefficient was slightly negative for resistance to subclinical (-0.058 &#177; 0.055) and clinical (-0.034 &#177; 0.076) mastitis, possibly due to low selection for the immunological candidate genes that influence these traits. The genotypic profiles for the candidate loci per K-means group were obtained, as well as the group distribution through the graphics of the principal component analysis. The genotypic profiles showed high genetic diversity among groups. Resistance to clinical mastitis had the lowest presence of the heterozygous genotypes. Although the percentage of highly inbred animals (&gt;50%) is up to 13.3%, there are highly heterozygous groups in terms of the studied traits, a favorable indicator of the presence of genetic diversity. The results of this study constitute evidence of the genetic potential of the Mexican Braunvieh population to improve mastitis-related traits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As an alternative, traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) was used in this study for its lack of drug resistance and low toxicity. Huangqin-honghua-pugongying-jinyinhua extract (HHPJE), a novel TCVM, consists of the extracts of Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis), Honghua (Carthami Flos), Pugongying (Taraxacum) and Jinyinhua (Lonicerae Japonicae Flos), and was developed to treat bovine mastitis. In this study, we evaluated the toxicity, bacteriostatic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of HHPJE. Our results show that HHPJE did not show any acute oral toxicity and can be considered safe for oral administration. Additionally, HHPJE possessed a dose-dependent antibacterial effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. HHPJE (60, 30 and 15 g/kg) can reduce the abdominal pain by 44.83 &#177; 7.69%, 43.15 &#177; 9.50% and 26.14 &#177; 4.17%, respectively. The percentages of anti-inflammation inhibition (60, 30 and 15 g/kg) were 35.34 &#177; 2.17%, 22.29 &#177; 2.74% and 12.06 &#177; 3.61%, respectively. The inhibition rates (60, 30 and 15 g/kg) of antipyretic activity were 82.05%, 65.71% and 52.80%, respectively. The evaluation of pharmacodynamics and toxicity indicate that HHPJE possesses significant bacteriostatic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic potential, and also that it is safe for acute oral toxicity, which means it has potential value for treating bovine mastitis in future and alleviating clinical symptoms with no drug resistance or side effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The CAVM use in Swedish dogs is largely unknown, and the aim of this study was to explore this use. Electronic questionnaires were distributed to dog owners, small animal veterinary practitioners, and CAVM therapists. A total of 253 dog owners responded. Except for massage, stretching, and laser therapy, more than 75% of the respondents stated that they did not use CAVM for their dogs. Of the 216 responding veterinarians, 39% did not use CAVM. CAVM use was more common among respondents with &lt;10 years of work experience as compared to those with &gt;10 years of work experience (p &lt; 0.05). Almost half of the 124 responding CAVM therapists treated dogs; the most frequently used methods included massage, stretching, and acupressure. A majority of all respondents found the current Swedish regulation of CAVM insufficient. Although CAVM use in Swedish dogs appears to be uncommon, there is a need for scientific assessment of CAVM in dogs as regards safety and effectiveness for different indications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, scant research is available validating these claims. This study aimed to review the recent peer reviewed literature to better describe the body of knowledge surrounding the relationship between pet ownership and mental health. A literature search was conducted in May 2020 using two databases to identify articles that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. After title review, abstract review, and then full article review, 54 articles were included in the final analysis. Of the 54 studies, 18 were conducted in the general population, 15 were conducted in an older adult population, eight were conducted in children and adolescents, nine focused on people with chronic disease, and four examined a specific unique population. Forty-one of the studies were cross-sectional, 11 were prospective longitudinal cohorts, and two were other study designs. For each of the articles, the impact of pet ownership on the mental health of owners was divided into four categories: positive impact (n = 17), mixed impact (n = 19), no impact (n = 13), and negative impact (n = 5). Among the reviewed articles, there was much variation in population studied and study design, and these differences make direct comparison challenging. However, when focusing on the impact of pet ownership on mental health, the results were variable and not wholly supportive of the benefit of pets on mental health. Future research should use more consistent methods across broader populations and the development of a pet-ownership survey module for use in broad, population surveys would afford a better description of the true relationship of pet ownership and mental health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there is limited research on substantiating these assertions. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, evaluate, and summarize primary research on the relationship between cat and/or dog ownership and cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity to inform future research on pet ownership and chronic disease. How pet ownership was defined/measured, and identification of the chronic disease variables and health behaviors most often measured were emphasized. Two researchers independently searched PubMed and Web of Science, where One Health literature are mostly likely to be indexed, for peer-reviewed literature on pet ownership and CVD, T2D, and obesity. A review of 4541 titles and abstracts for relevance resulted in 34 manuscripts eligible for full-text review. Two researchers assessed each eligible manuscript and extracted data only from those that met the inclusion criteria (n = 14). Ten studies on CVD, four studies on obesity, and zero studies on T2D met the study criteria. The CVD and obesity variables varied and were not well described. The relationship between pet ownership and CVD and obesity varied (positive, negative, mixed effects, and no effect). Generalizability lacked across all studies: most studies were with Non-Hispanic White populations. Other areas of weakness were quality of study outcomes and instrument validity. Operationalization of pet ownership varied (from no verification to confirmed pet registration). Integration of the evidence-based influence of the human-animal connection through pet ownership on CVD and obesity may make prevention, mitigation, and treatment strategies more robust.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Migratory avian species, which cover long distance by their flight, may deeply influence the ticks' distribution worldwide; in particular, they can introduce in a given geographic area new tick species and related tick-borne pathogens. Studies about the detection of tick-borne agents in birds are not numerous, whereas more attention has been turned to the presence of these microorganisms in ticks carried by birds. The present review focused on the role of avian populations in the epidemiology of rickettsioses and babesioses, which represent two severe problems for the health of humans and other mammals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We isolated 890 E. coli and tested for O-serogroups, virulence genes, haemolysis, and multilocus sequence typing. The predominant virotypes were STb:EAST1:AIDA-I, F18b:Stx2e:AIDA-I, F18:STa:STb:Stx2e, and eae:Paa in enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), ETEC/STEC, and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), respectively. Regarding serogroups, O139, O149, O141, and O121 were mostly detected in F18:Stx2e:AIDA-I, F4:LT:STb:EAST1, F18:STa:STb, and F18:Stx2e:EAST1, respectively. There was a significant change in the frequency of the O141:F18ac:STa:STb (an increase from 1.6% to 10.1%) and O139:F18ab:Stx2e:AIDA-I (a decrease from 13.0% to 5.3%) virotypes in ETEC and STEC, respectively, from 2015 to 2019. The O141:F18ac:STa:STb virotype was mostly detected in the central area and was spreading to the southern area. The odds ratios between haemolysis and virotypes were 11.0, 6.25, and 8.57 in F18:STa:STb, F18:Stx2e:AIDA-I, and F4:LT:STb:EAST1, respectively. Our findings provide insights regarding the recent prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in South Korea and could be used for the development of vaccines for E. coli responsible for PWD and ED in post-weaning piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Types of Ethical Challenging Situations Depicted in Vignettes Published in the Veterinary Literature from 1990 to 2020.</Title>	<Abstract>Veterinary team members encounter a wide range of ethically challenging situations (ECS) in their work. Inability to resolve ECS in accordance with their values may negatively impact the wellbeing of veterinary team members. We sought to determine the types of ECS described in published ethical vignettes in the veterinary literature. We performed a strategic literature search, followed by a thematic analysis of vignettes published in the veterinary literature from 1990-2020. We identified 567 published vignettes in 544 publications. In the majority of vignettes, the protagonist was a veterinarian (61.6%) and the most common categories of animal involved were dogs (28.0%), livestock in general (10.8%), and cattle (10.6%). The primary type of ECS was coded for each scenario, generating 29 themes. These findings extend knowledge about types of ECS that may be encountered by veterinary team members. These themes can help to inform curricula and better prepare veterinary team members to navigate ECS. They may also highlight factors that contribute to ECS that can be addressed on a broad scale, such as through regulation, continuing professional development, or stakeholder education. Knowing that others may experience similar ECS may help veterinary team members feel part of a moral community.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examination, masses were found in several regions including the lung, right kidney, and peritoneum. Additionally, an extradural mass at the region of T13-L1 was identified, which is assumed to related to the chief complaint, progressive hind limb paresis. With the consent of the owner, a dorsal laminectomy was performed to remove the mass and surrounding tissues for the palliation of the hind limb paresis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical examination revealed the mass to be consistent with an undifferentiated (high-grade) pleomorphic sarcoma. The patient presented with recurrence of the hind limb paresis, respiratory discomfort, and urinary incontinence. The owner declined treatment and the dog was euthanized. Systemic metastasis was confirmed on postmortem microscopic examination. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing multiple undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with extradural involvement developing into the vertebral canal through the intervertebral space, resulting in spinal damage, in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) plays an important role in this process, but it is not fully characterized in E. multilocularis yet. The results of genome-wide analysis showed that the Echinococcus species contained four fba genes (FBA1-4), all of which had the domain of FBA I and multiple conserved active sites. EmFBA1 was mainly located in the germinal layer and the posterior of the protoscolex. The enzyme activity of EmFBA1 was 67.42 U/mg with Km and Vmax of 1.75 mM and 0.5 mmol/min, respectively. EmFBA1 was only susceptible to Fe[3+] but not to the other four ions (Na[+], Ca[2+], K[+], Mg[2+]), and its enzyme activity was remarkably lost in the presence of 0.5 mM Fe[3+]. The current study reveals the biochemical characters of EmFBA1 and is informative for further investigation of its role in the glycolysis in E. multilocularis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The bird was captured and submitted to the Southeastern Raptor Center of the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine for evaluation. On presentation, the bird was thin with a body condition score of approximately 1.5 out of 5. The bird died during the examination and was submitted for necropsy. At the necropsy, there was a severe loss of muscle mass over the body, and the keel was prominent. The liver and spleen were moderately enlarged with pale tan to red foci randomly scattered throughout the parenchyma. A histopathologic observation revealed multifocal to coalescing areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with intralesional protozoans in the liver, spleen, lungs, kidney, sciatic nerve, esophagus, cerebrum, heart, and proventriculus. Immunohistochemistry using anti-Toxoplasma gondii-specific antibodies showed a strong positive labeling of the parasite. Semi-nested PCR, specific for the B1 gene of T. gondii, successfully identified T. gondii. This is the first confirmed case of T. gondii infection in an osprey.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we found that the oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and Salmonella infection induced colitis. In the process, the expression levels of M cell differentiation-related genes were synchronized with the kinetics of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, MyD88[-/-] mice exhibited significantly lower expression levels of M cell differentiation-related genes. However, DSS induced colitis in MyD88[-/-] mice but failed to promote the transcription of M cell differentiation related genes. Furthermore, the receptor activator of the Nuclear Factor-&#954;B ligand (RANKL) upregulated the transcription of M cell differentiation related genes in murine intestinal organoids prepared from both WT and MyD88[-/-] mice. Meanwhile, fewer changes in M cell differentiation related genes were found in MyD88[-/-] mice as compared to WT mice. Hence, we concluded that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an essential molecule for colitis- and RANKL-related differentiation of M cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A nanohydroxyapatite-based hydrogel (HAP hydrogel) was developed to diminish the limitations of hydroxyapatite for post-extraction socket preservation (PSP). However, the effect of the HAP hydrogel in dogs has still not been widely investigated. Moreover, there are few studies on PSP in dogs suffering from clinical periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the HAP hydrogel for PSP in dogs with periodontitis. In five dogs with periodontitis, the first molar (309 and 409) of each hemimandible was extracted. Consequently, all the ten sockets were filled with HAP-hydrogel. Intraoral radiography was performed on the day of operation and 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post operation. The Kruskal-Wallis test and paired t-test were adopted for alveolar bone regeneration analysis. The results demonstrated that the radiographic grading, bone height measurement, and bone regeneration analysis were positively significant at all follow-up times compared to the day of operation. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy imaging after immersion showed a homogeneous distribution of apatite formation on the hydrogel surface. Our investigation suggested that the HAP hydrogel effectively enhances socket regeneration in dogs with periodontitis and can be applied as a bone substitute for PSP in veterinary dentistry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Understanding the role of allergen dose, frequency and duration of exposure in triggering infections requires a model. Most models elicit acute inflammation and do not mimic real-life disease. Here we describe the effects of allergen exposures on development of infections in a model of chronic CAD. Diagnosis of pyoderma was based on clinical signs and consistent cytology. Study 1 evaluated the role of duration of exposure keeping the daily dose constant (25 mg/day). The one-week protocol involved three exposures, 3 days in a row. The one-month protocol involved twice-weekly challenges for 4 weeks. The three-month protocol involved twice-weekly challenges for 12 weeks. Study 2 evaluated different daily doses while keeping constant the total weekly dose (25 mg) and duration (3 weeks). Low-dose used 5 mg/day for 5 days, each week. High-dose used 12.5 mg/day twice-weekly. In Study 1, the longer the exposure, the more dogs developed pyoderma (6/9 in the three-month study, 2/9 in the one-month and 0 in the one-week). In Study 2, low-dose daily exposure caused more infections (5/8) than high-dose infrequent exposure (0/8). It is concluded that low-grade, daily exposure for a long time is most relevant for development of staphylococcal infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of strain elastography, the most accessible modality in clinical practice, to discriminate between different histological types of malignant mammary neoplasms in the canine species, which can provide complementary information in real time to the diagnosis and thus help in the choice of surgical technique. A total of 34 females with 56 mammary carcinomas were selected and classified into three histological groups according to their aggressiveness. The histological and elastographic characteristics of these malignant tumors were analyzed and compared to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of strain elastography. Visual score presented a sensitivity of 88.0%, specificity of 58.1%, and accuracy of 71.43% in distinguishing the most aggressive group of carcinomas. The strain ratio had a sensitivity of 84.0%, specificity of 61.1%, and accuracy of 69.64%. On the other hand, intratumoral strain ratio obtained a sensitivity of 71.40% and specificity of 61.90% when intratumoral fibrosis was taken as reference, with an accuracy of 66.07%. Similarly, peritumoral strain ratio was also positively related to fibrosis in the periphery of lesions (p &#8804; 0.001), with a sensitivity of 93.80%, specificity of 77.50% and an accuracy of 92.87%. In conclusion, accuracy of this elastographic modality can be a useful method to differentiate more aggressive histological types. Therefore, it represents an additional diagnostic technique useful in the daily clinic thanks to the short time required for the examination, which allows real-time visualization and immediate interpretation of the results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Honey represents a natural source of exogenous DNA, which allows for the detection of different honey bee pathogens and parasites. In the present study, we extracted DNA from 20 honey samples from different regions in Bulgaria and tested for the presence of DNA of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, as well as Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Only Nosema ceranae was detected, showing up in 30% of all samples, which confirms the widespread prevalence of this pathogen. All positive samples were found in plain regions of the country, while this pathogen was not detected in mountainous parts. None of the samples gave positive amplifications for the Nosema apis and Varroa mite. The obtained results from this study confirm previous observations that eDNA contained in honey is a potent source for effective biomonitoring of actual diseases in the honey bee.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Target genes associated with hoof disease were obtained from the GeneCards database. Compound-target, compound-target-pathway-disease visualization networks, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by Cytoscape. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed in R language. Molecular docking analysis was done using AutoDockTools. The visual network analysis showed that four active compounds, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, allocryptopine and protopine, were associated with the 10 target genes/proteins (SRC, MAPK3, MTOR, ESR1, PIK3CA, BCL2L1, JAK2, GSK3B, MAPK1, and AR) obtained from the screen. The enrichment analysis indicated that the cAMP, PI3K-Akt, and ErbB signaling pathways may be key signaling pathways in network pharmacology. The molecular docking results showed that sanguinarine, chelerythrine, allocryptopine, and protopine bound well to MAPK3 and JAK2. A comprehensive bioinformatics-based network topology strategy and molecular docking study has elucidated the multi-component synergistic mechanism of action of M. cordata in the treatment of bovine hoof disease, offering the possibility of developing M. cordata as a new source of drugs for hoof disease treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, a total number of 124 farms were sampled; Salmonella isolates were identified by the alternative technique VIDAS Easy Salmonella. The susceptibility of Salmonella isolates was assessed against 21 antimicrobials using the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar using antimicrobial discs. Some antimicrobial resistance genes were identified using PCR. The prevalence rate of Salmonella infection, in the sampled farms, was estimated at 19.9% (64/322). Moreover, a total number of 13 different serotypes were identified. High rate of resistance was identified against nalidixic acid (82.85%), amoxicillin (81.25%), streptomycin (75%), and ciprofloxacin (75%). Alarming level of resistance to ertapenem (12.5%) was noticed. A total of 87.5% (56/64) of isolated strains were recognized as MDR. Three MDR strains were extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBL)-producers and three MDR strains were cephalosporinase-producers. The blaCTX-M gene was amplified in all the three ESBL strains. The qnrB gene was not amplified in fluoroquinolones-resistant strains. The tetA and tetB genes were amplified in 5% (2/40) and 2.5% (1/40) of tetracycline-resistant strains, respectively. The dfrA1 gene was amplified in five of the 20 trimethoprim-resistant strains. The mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, and mcr-5 genes were not amplified in any of the phenotypically colistin-resistant strains. In terms of integrase genes int1 and int2, only gene class 2 was amplified in 11% (7/64) of analyzed strains. Risk factors, such as the poor level of cleaning and disinfection, the lack of antimicrobial treatment at the start of the breeding, and a crawl space duration lower than 15 days, were associated with high Salmonella infection in birds. These data should be considered when preparing salmonellosis control programs in Tunisian broiler flocks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ponies, Standardbreds and Andalusian horses were adapted to consuming either a control fibre-based diet (n = 9), a hypercaloric cereal-rich diet (n = 12) or a hypercaloric fat-rich diet (n = 12) over 20 weeks. Total faecal collection was performed over 24 h to determine apparent total tract digestibility of gross energy, dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), starch, crude protein and crude fat. There was no effect of breed on apparent digestibility for any of the nutrients studied (all p &gt; 0.05). However, there was a significant effect of diet, with animals consuming the cereal-rich or fat-rich diets demonstrating higher digestibility of gross energy, DM, NDF and crude protein compared with those consuming the control diet (all p &lt; 0.05). Animals adapted to the cereal-rich diet demonstrated higher digestibility of starch (p &lt; 0.001) and animals adapted to the fat-rich diet demonstrated higher digestibility of fat (p &lt; 0.001). This study found that horses and ponies had similar nutrient digestibility when adapted to the same diets and management conditions. Limitations included the relatively small number of animals from each breed per diet group and the short period of total faecal collection. The tendency towards increased adiposity in ponies and Andalusian-type horse breeds is more likely to reflect differences in metabolism, rather than differences in feed digestibility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study is to report the feasibility and outcome of tibial plateau leveling techniques (TPLT) to treat dogs with persistent lameness, suspected to be secondary to persistent stifle instability, following (TTAT). Medical records of dogs presented for persistent lameness after TTAT were reviewed. Preoperative data included orthopedic examination, lameness score and radiographs. Inclusion criteria included performance of a surgery to address persistent lameness and suspected instability. Short-term follow up data included orthopedic examination and radiographs of the stifle. Long-term follow up was based on postoperative Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs (LOAD) questionnaire. Seven dogs were included in the study. Mean subjective preoperative lameness score was 3 &#177; 1.53. Mean preoperative patellar ligament angle relative to the tibial plateau (PLA[TP]) was 94&#176; and mean tibial plateau angle (TPA) was 28&#176;. Six dogs had tibial plateau leveling osteotomy and one had modified cranial closing wedge ostectomy. Mean postoperative PLA[TP] was 79&#176; and mean TPA was 5&#176;. Mean subjective lameness score at follow up was 0.57 &#177; 0.49. Minor complications were present in 2 dogs and major complication in 1 dog. Mean LOAD questionnaire score was 6.6/52. TPLT can be performed after TTAT and may improve clinical function and stability in these cases in which persistent instability is suspected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35051101</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Effective Veterinary Clinical Teaching in a Variety of Teaching Settings.</Title>	<Abstract>This review explores different modalities for clinical teaching of veterinary learners globally. Effective clinical teaching aims to prepare graduates for a successful career in clinical practice. Unfortunately, there is scant literature concerning clinical teaching in veterinary medicine. Our intent for this review is to stimulate and/or facilitate discussion and/or research in this important area. We discuss the different forms that veterinary clinical teaching can take, depending on their setting, which can be university-based clinical activities, work-based in commercial clinical practices, or in a traditional academic setting with little to no real-time exposure to clients and patients. We suggest that each of these modalities has a place in clinical teaching of veterinary learners at any point in the curriculum but that a mix of these approaches will likely provide an improved experience for the learner. Further, we discuss strategies to improve clinical teaching in these different settings. Potential strategies related to the teaching skills of clinical instructors could include training in delivery of clinical teaching in a variety of learning settings, and instructors' official recognition, including opportunities for career progression. Potential strategies to improve clinical teaching in different teaching settings would vary with the learning settings. For example, in traditional academic settings, case-based learning with incorporation of simulation models is one proposed strategy. The involvement of learners in 'teach-others' is a strategy for both traditional academic and clinical settings. Finally, clearly addressing Day One competencies is required in any clinical teaching setting.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight client-owned dogs diagnosed with multi-level cervical intervertebral disc protrusions using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this retrospective case series. Microendoscopic dorsal laminectomies (MEL) were performed with an integrated endoscopic system to the cranial and caudal vertebrae of the affected intervertebral joints. Pre- and post-operative neurological status, operation time, intra-operative complications, and postoperative complications were reviewed. Post-operative CT images were obtained to measure the dimensions of laminectomy and compared to those of planned laminectomy. Full endoscopic procedures were feasible in 7 dogs (87.5%) and the laminectomy dimensions were in agreement with pre-operative planning. In all dogs, major intra- and postoperative complications did not occur. Conversion to open surgery was required in one case. Short-term postoperative clinical deterioration was found in two dogs. Long-term clinical outcomes were good and comparable to those reported in previous studies of open dorsal laminectomies. MEL is a promising minimally invasive approach to multi-level cervical dorsal laminectomy for intervertebral disc protrusions. This technique may improve postoperative discomfort compared to the open approach. Further studies are needed to directly compare outcomes between these two approaches.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The original host of the nematode parasite is the Eurasian red deer (Cervus elaphus), although other cervids and small ruminants may also be affected. The two wapitis imported from Canada were kept in an enclosure with the Slovenian red deer herd. After developing debilitating neurological signs, the wapitis were euthanized and examined for possible causes. A histopathological examination of the brain of the first wapiti revealed severe diffuse perivascular meningoencephalitis with chronic vasculitis, and some cross-sections of nematodes were found in the leptomeninges. A necropsy of the second wapiti revealed severe pachymeningitis and leptomeningitis, where several adult nematode parasites were found. E. cervi was confirmed by molecular methods. The prevalence of E. cervi in the European red deer population is high, but no study has been conducted to assess its prevalence in Slovenia. This was the first confirmation of E. cervi in Slovenia and the first infection with this parasite described in Europe in a wapiti. Elaphostrongylus cervi should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in Europe for all ruminants grazing on pastures frequented by red deer and showing neurological clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 24 growing black kids (initial body weight (BW) = 16.4 &#177; 0.49 kg) were allocated to one of three diets at random. Lupin was included in the diet at a rate of 0 (control; CON), 100 (LUP100), or 200 g/kg (LUP200) of total dry matter (DM). The trial lasted for 91 days divided into 7 and 84 days to be used for adaptation and data collection, respectively. Feed intake was evaluated daily throughout the study. At the commencement and the end of the study, each kid's body weight was measured to determine its average daily gain (ADG). On day 70, 5 kids were chosen at random from each group to investigate nutrient in vivo digestibility and N balance. At the end of the study, all of the kids were slaughtered to examine carcass features. Nutrient intakes (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and ether extract) were higher (p &#8804; 0.01) in LUP-containing diets than in the CON diet. The average daily gain was greater (p &#8804; 0.03) in diets containing lupin grains than in the CON diet. Cost of gain ($US/kg growth) was lower (p = 0.004) in kids fed diets containing lupin than the CON diet. Dry matter and CP digestibility rates were greater (p &#8804; 0.03) in lupin diets. Retained N was higher (p = 0.04) in lupin-containing diets than in the CON diet. Cold carcass weight was higher (p &lt; 0.05) for kids consuming the LUP100 diet than the CON diet. In lupin diets, carcass cut weights were higher (p &lt; 0.05). Results of the current study indicate that feeding black kids diets containing lupin grains at 100 or 200 g/kg DM basis is cost effective and would increase profitability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The important genera that are pathogenic in animals include Trichophyton and Microsporum. Microsporum canis is an important species because it can cause zoonosis and is commonly found in domestic animals. Cats, which live very close to humans, may expose humans to this pathogen. This research focused on the epidemiology of M. canis found in cats. Hair samples were collected via the Mackenzie technique from cats with and without skin lesions, preliminarily examined with 10% KOH preparation, and cultured for fungal identification. Samples were confirmed with molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. Samples were collected from 138 cats located in 93 households, 43 from cats with skin lesions (31.16%) and 95 from cats without skin lesions (68.84%). Eighteen cats with lesions (13.04%) and ten cats without lesions (7.2%) were found to carry M. canis. In eleven of the eighteen cats both with skin lesions and positive for M. canis (61.11%), the pathogen was found both at the site of the lesion and at other sites in the body. Because the pathogen can be found in the hair of cats with and without skin lesions, owners, keepers, veterinarians, and others who come into contact with these animals are at risk of infection if they are not aware or do not take precautions after contact with them.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we isolated a Brucella strain (CD3) from a subclinically infected pet dog in Sichuan Province, Southwestern China. Classical biotyping methods and molecular biological tests (BCSP31 and BcSS PCR) proved that the strain belonged to B. canis. Furthermore, B. canis CD3 and another two B. canis strains (WJ5 and YA4), which were all isolated from pet dogs in Sichuan, were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Our results showed that the three B. canis strains were identified as the same sequence type (ST21). The present study is the first to report B. canis strain from a subclinically infected pet dog in China, indicating a potential threat to public health posed by subclinical infections in pet dogs. We suggest that screening for B. canis should be incorporated into routine medical examination of pet dogs and other companion animals in areas with a history of animal or human brucellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to resistance phenomena to synthetic acaricides being a constraint in affected farms, the search for plant derivatives as acaricides has increased dramatically in recent years. In this work, essential oils obtained from two Ecuadorian plants, Ambrosia peruviana and Lepechinia mutica (EOAp, EOLm), traditionally used as insecticides in indigenous communities, were studied on larvae and engorged females at the parasitic stages of R. microplus. Larvae and females were treated with five (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 1%) and six concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2 and 4%), respectively, of each EOsAp/Lm. A 98-99% larval mortality was achieved with 0.5% of both EOsAp/Lm. EOAp inhibited oviposition and egg hatching up to 82% and 80%, respectively, and had an overall efficacy of 93.12%. Efficacy of EOLm was 72.84%, due to the low influence of EOLm on reproductive parameters. By steam distillation and GC-MS analysis, &#947;-Curcumene was identified as the main constituent (52.02%) in the EOAp and Shyobunol (10.80%) in EOLm. The results suggest that major components of both essential oils should be further studied as promissory acaricides against R. microplus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Certainly, it is irreplaceable for the treatment of parasitic pathologies in both human and veterinary medicine, and the latter represents the major field of its application. It has been called the "drug for the world's poor" because of its role as a saviour for those living on the margins of society, in underdeveloped areas afflicted by devastating and debilitating diseases, such as Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic filariasis. It showed huge, unexpected potential as an antibacterial (Chlamydia trachomatis and mycobacteria), and it has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. The research line described here is placed right in the middle of the investigation on the impact of this drug as an antimicrobial and an immunomodulator. Being a drug widely employed for mass administration, it is mandatory to broaden the knowledge of its possible interaction with bacterial growth and its generation of antimicrobial resistance. Equally, it is important to understand the impact of these drugs on the immune systems of animal species, e.g., horses and dogs, in which this drug is often used. More importantly, could immunomodulation and antibacterial activity promote both bacterial growth and the occurrence of resistance mechanisms?</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Their suitability for skin barrier studies is unknown. Measurement of transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) evaluates epithelial permeability. We compared TEER and tight junction (TJ) expression in CPEKs and normal keratinocytes (NK) harvested from biopsies of normal dogs. CPEKs and NK were grown until confluence (D0) and for 13 additional days. Slides were fixed on D0 and stained with ZO-1 and claudin-1 antibodies. Five images/antibody were taken, randomized and evaluated blindly by three investigators for intensity, staining location, granularity, and continuousness. Cell size and variability were evaluated. TEER increased overtime to 2000 Ohms/cm in NK, while remained around 100-150 Ohms/cm in CPEK. ANOVA showed significant effect of time (p &lt; 0.0001), group (p &lt; 0.0001) and group x time interaction (p &lt; 0.0001) for TEER. Size of CPEKs was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) smaller and less variable (p = 0.0078) than NK. Intensity of claudin-1 staining was greater in CPEKs (p &lt; 0.0001) while granularity was less in CPEKs (p = 0.0012). For ZO-1, cytoplasmic staining was greater in CPEK (p &lt; 0.0001) while membrane continuousness of staining was greater in NK (p = 0.0002). We conclude that CPEKs grown in monolayer are not representative of NK for permeability studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CL is generally characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and histological features that may overlap with epitheliotropic lymphoma. Therefore, its neoplastic or reactive nature is still debated. Here, we describe clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and clonality features of a retrospective case series of 19 cats and 10 dogs with lesions histologically compatible with CL. In both species, alopecia, erythema, and scales were the most frequent clinical signs. Histologically, a dermal infiltrate of small to medium-sized lymphocytes, occasionally extending to the subcutis, was always identified. Conversely, when present, epitheliotropism was generally mild. In cats, the infiltrate was consistently CD3+; in dogs, a mixture of CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes was observed only in 4 cases. The infiltrate was polyclonal in all cats, while BCR and TCR clonal rearrangements were identified in dogs. Overall, cats had a long-term survival (median overall survival = 1080 days) regardless of the treatment received, while dogs showed a shorter and variable clinical course, with no evident associations with clinicopathological features. In conclusion, our results support a reactive nature of the disease in cats, associated with prolonged survival; despite a similar histological picture, canine CL is associated with a more heterogeneous lymphocytic infiltrate, clonality results, and response to treatment, implying a more challenging discrimination between CL and CEL in this species. A complete diagnostic workup and detailed follow-up information on a higher number of cases is warrant for dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infectious coryza has major economic effects due to decreased egg production in growing birds and slowed growth in broilers. In this study, we isolated and identified 40 strains of A. paragallinarum from chickens that showed typical clinical signs of coryza in part of China from 2019 to 2020. Using a hemagglutination-inhibition test, 11 isolates were identified as serovar A, 10 isolates were identified as serovar B, and 19 isolates were identified as serovar C. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests showed that high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were encountered for compounds sulfamethoxine sodium and oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Especially, of the 40 A. paragallinarum isolates, 30% had an MIC value of compound sulfamethoxine sodium of 64 &#956;g/mL, 10% of 128 &#956;g/mL, and 15% of 256 &#956;g/mL. For oxytetracycline hydrochloride, 85% of isolates showed MIC values of 64 &#956;g/mL or more. Excitingly, the MIC values of &#946;-lactamase (amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ceftiofur) were low, with 77.5%, 70%, and 92.5% of isolates having an MIC value of &#8804;1 &#956;g/mL, respectively.

Mild palpation induced pain and rigid corpora cavernosa with flaccid glans were observed during physical examination. Ultrasonography of the penis did not detect significant blood flow in the penile cavernosal artery. The drawing of aspirate blood from cavernosal bodies for gas analysis was impossible because of the anatomically small penis size of cats. Conservative management, including topical steroid ointment, lidocaine gel, gabapentin, and diazepam, was prescribed for supportive management. The clinical signs resolved, and ultrasonographic examination of the penis revealed no abnormalities. The cat remains clinically well without recurrence during the 6 months after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-ischemic priapism in a cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Time-lapse radiographic and ultrasound examinations were performed before and after a single intramuscular dose of 5 mg kg[-1] butorphanol, 10 mg kg[-1] morphine, or 10 mg kg[-1] tramadol. Pyloric and duodenal contraction counts by ultrasonography and radiographic repletion scores for the stomach and caecum were analysed using a mixed linear model. No significant effect was noted on ultrasound examinations of pyloric and duodenal contractions after administration of an opioid treatment. Morphine had a significant effect on the stomach and the caecum repletion scores, whereas butorphanol had a significant effect only on the caecum repletion score. Tramadol had no significant effect on the stomach or caecum repletion scores. The present findings suggest that a single dose of 5 mg kg[-1] butorphanol or 10 mg kg[-1] morphine temporarily slows gastrointestinal transit in healthy rabbits, preventing physiological progression of the alimentary bolus without the induction of ileus. In contrast, a single dose of 10 mg kg[-1] tramadol has no such effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis syndrome is a disease that affects older horses and significantly reduces their quality of life. The only effective treatment for this condition is extraction of the incisors. The described case compares the recovery process of the alveolar area after extraction of incisors during the course of EOTRH syndrome without and with the use of a chamber, in horses with the same clinical picture of the disease, of the same age, and living in the same conditions.

Glioma-bearing canine patients may serve as promising preclinical models for human therapies, including complementary medicine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of mistletoe extract (Viscum album) alone and in combination with mebendazole in an in vitro model of canine high-grade astrocytoma using the cell line SDT-3G. SDT-3G cells were exposed to a range of concentrations of mistletoe extract alone to obtain an IC50. In separate experiments, cells were exposed to mebendazole at a previously determined IC50 (0.03 &#181;M) alone or in conjunction with varying concentrations of mistletoe extract to determine the additive effects. The IC50 for mistletoe alone was 5.644 &#177; 0.09 SD &#956;g/mL. The addition of mistletoe at 5 &#956;g/mL to mebendazole at 0.03 &#181;M led to increased cell death compared to what would be expected for each drug separately. The cytotoxicity of mistletoe in vitro and its additive effect with mebendazole support future expanded in vitro and in vivo studies in dogs and supply early evidence that this may be a useful adjunct therapeutic agent for use in glioma-bearing dogs. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published report of Viscum album extract in canine glioma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this review, we investigate the acute (i.e., immediate), short-, and long-term implications of piglet processing on behavioral, physiological, clinical, and performance parameters, and how welfare impairments depend on performance instead of sham procedure, alternative techniques, or the age of the piglets. Welfare indicators that have been used to determine the least distressing procedures and knowledge gaps with regard to the procedures are identified and discussed. Tail docking and especially piglet castration have been the most researched topics, whereas marking for identification has been rarely addressed. Few or no studies have investigated the effects of teeth resection and tail docking on piglets of different age groups. Additionally, results are often found to be inconsistent, highlighting the need for additional research to determine the optimal age for processing. Studies comparing different processing techniques have produced contradictory results, but ear notching, teeth clipping, hot cautery tail docking, and tearing during castration have been determined to result in increased pain. Generally, a shorter procedure duration can reduce stress, with operator training having a distinct impact on piglet welfare during processing. As such, these topics should be further investigated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be used as a main or adjuvant treatment for inflammation, leading to the main aim of this study, which was to verify the applicability of HBOT as a safe and tolerable tool in SIRS-positive dogs. (2) Methods: This prospective cohort study included 49 dogs who showed two or more parameters of SIRS, divided into the Traumatic Study Group (n = 32) and the Non-Traumatic Study Group (n = 17). All dogs were submitted to HBOT for 60-90 min sessions, with 2.4-2.8 ATA. (3) Results: This study revealed that 73.5% (36/49) of dogs showed improvement, and the minimum number of HBOT sessions was two, with a mean of 12.73. The number of days between diagnosis and the beginning of HBOT showed statistical significance (p = 0.031) relative to the clinical outcome. No dogs showed any major side effects. (4) Conclusions: We concluded that HBOT may be safe and tolerable for SIRS-positive dogs, and that it should be applied as early as possible.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This etiology has also been reported for non-epithelial cutaneous tumors in other species. To date, no cases of auricular non-epithelial cutaneous neoplasms erased in a contest of actinic keratosis in cats have been reported. The aim of this study was to describe feline auricular non-epithelial cutaneous neoplasms associated with typical UV-induced cutaneous lesions and solar elastosis. The study was conducted on five feline cases diagnosed with auricular non-epithelial cutaneous tumors (two fibrosarcomas, one mixosarcoma, one epithelioid melanoma and one hemangiosarcoma), selected from the Tumor Registry of the Department of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Pisa (1998-2018). Ten and six feline auricular biopsies of normal skin and skin with actinic keratosis, respectively, were used as controls. Orcein stain was used to investigate solar elastosis. Histological changes related to chronic solar irradiation were documented in the skin adjacent to the neoplastic lesions in the five cats. Considering the anatomical localization and the results of histopathology, this study suggests that non-epithelial cutaneous neoplasms may have a UV-induced etiopathogenesis in the feline species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on sensitivity and specificity calculated for each of the RIM tests, the utility of RIM tests was compared. Seventy faecal samples originating from shelter cats housed in quarantine were examined. Out of 70 samples analyzed by real-time PCR, 44 (62.9%) were positive. Significantly more cats (p &lt; 0.05) tested positive than negative. Neither age nor sex of the cats played a significant role (p &gt; 0.05) in the shedding status of the virus. The sensitivity of the RIM tests was found to be at low (&lt;35%; RIM tests A and C) to satisfactory level (&gt;50%, RIM test B). The number of virus particles determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis did not significantly correlate with the results detected by any of the RIM tests (p &gt; 0.05). The results of this study indicate that the use of rapid antigen RIM tests in routine screening of FCoV shedding status in shelter cats is limited due to the occurrence of a high number of false negative results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202290</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Nonpharmacological Treatment Strategies for the Management of Canine Chronic Inflammatory Enteropathy-A Narrative Review.</Title>	<Abstract>Chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) refers to a heterogeneous group of idiopathic diseases of the dog characterised by persistent gastrointestinal (GI) clinical signs. If conventional dietary treatment alone would be unsuccessful, management of CIE is traditionally attained by the use of pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs. While being rather effective, however, these drugs are endowed with side effects, which may impact negatively on the animal's quality of life. Therefore, novel, safe and effective therapies for CIE are highly sought after. As gut microbiota imbalances are often associated with GI disorders, a compelling rationale exists for the use of nonpharmacological methods of microbial manipulation in CIE, such as faecal microbiota transplantation and administration of pre-, pro-, syn- and postbiotics. In addition to providing direct health benefits to the host via a gentle modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition and function, these treatments may also possess immunomodulatory and epithelial barrier-enhancing actions. Likewise, intestinal barrier integrity, along with mucosal inflammation, are deemed to be two chief therapeutic targets of mesenchymal stem cells and selected vegetable-derived bioactive compounds. Although pioneering studies have revealed encouraging findings regarding the use of novel treatment agents in CIE, a larger body of research is needed to address fully their mode of action, efficacy and safety.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202291</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Methodology and Neuromarkers for Cetaceans' Brains.</Title>	<Abstract>Cetacean brain sampling may be an arduous task due to the difficulty of collecting and histologically preparing such rare and large specimens. Thus, one of the main challenges of working with cetaceans' brains is to establish a valid methodology for an optimal manipulation and fixation of the brain tissue, which allows the samples to be viable for neuroanatomical and neuropathological studies. With this in view, we validated a methodology in order to preserve the quality of such large brains (neuroanatomy/neuropathology) and at the same time to obtain fresh brain samples for toxicological, virological, and microbiological analysis (neuropathology). A fixation protocol adapted to brains, of equal or even three times the size of human brains, was studied and tested. Finally, we investigated the usefulness of a panel of 20 antibodies (neuromarkers) associated with the normal structure and function of the brain, pathogens, age-related, and/or functional variations. The sampling protocol and some of the 20 neuromarkers have been thought to explore neurodegenerative diseases in these long-lived animals. To conclude, many of the typical measures used to evaluate neuropathological changes do not tell us if meaningful cellular changes have occurred. Having a wide panel of antibodies and histochemical techniques available allows for delving into the specific behavior of the neuronal population of the brain nuclei and to get a "fingerprint" of their real status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202292</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A Proposed Guideline for Performance of Emergency Surgical Airways in Small Animals: Analysis of Five Unsuccessfully Managed Cannot Intubate, Cannot Oxygenate Cases.</Title>	<Abstract>Objective-To describe three dogs and two cats diagnosed with a cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate (CICO) condition, and discuss the appropriateness and timing of emergency front-of-neck airway access (eFONA). The authors aim to increase awareness of CICO events and effective management strategies, which may result in faster airway access and improve patient outcomes. Case series summary-Three dogs and two cats could not be easily intubated resulting in the inability to deliver oxygen and contributing to their death. Emergency front-of-neck airway access was attempted in three cases, it could not be performed in one when indicated, and it was not considered in managing another. Conclusions-This is the first report of small animals suffering CICO emergencies and tracheostomy attempts without a concurrently secured airway. Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate events and eFONA attempts were managed sub-optimally in all cases, which likely contributed to the poor outcomes. Rapid diagnosis of CICO and early eFONA using appropriate techniques has the potential to improve the management of difficult airways in small animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from 200 randomly selected dairy cattle herds from Setif province of Algeria were analyzed by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results highlighted that 37% (95% CI: 30.31-43.69%) and 9% (95% CI: 5.03-12.96%) of BTM samples contained Coxiella burnetii antibodies and DNA, respectively. Based on Cohen's kappa coefficient, a very low agreement between the ELISA and PCR results was found (k = 0.0849) (95% CI: 0.00-0.189). For a second experiment, 186 whole blood samples of cows from farms with reproduction disorders were analyzed by molecular tools to detect C. burnetii. This study revealed an overall prevalence of 6.98% (95% CI: 3.32-10.65%). All positive samples determined by conventional PCR were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Eleven samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values lower than 35 were selected for genotyping by the multispacer sequence typing (MST) method. The MST12 genotype in BTM samples, the MST32 genotype and a new MST genotype (partial profile) in whole blood samples were identified. Obtained results have allowed us to better understand the epidemiology of bovine coxiellosis in the region of Setif.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The first race was held in 1818 in Belgium and since then, Belgium has led the world in pigeon breeding. Unfortunately, as in other sports, doping has become a major issue and doping controls have been implemented. This review provides information about pigeon racing, rules from the Royal Federation Colombophile of Belgium, and laws applicable in Belgium as doping control issues cannot be understood without including them as part of pigeon racing. The main pharmacological data concerning corticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anabolic steroids, pain relievers and narcotic analgesics, bronchodilators and &#946;-agonists, drugs acting on the central nervous system and other performance-enhancing drugs, in addition to methods relevant to doping in pigeons are presented.

The aim of this review is to evaluate applications and the development of urogenital laparoscopy from 2001 to 2021. (2) Methods: A scoping review of literature was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews on three databases (NCBI-PubMed, Web of Science-Thompson Reuters, and SciVerse Scopus). (3) Results: A total of 452 papers were identified. After duplicate removal and title screening, 181 papers underwent abstract screening. Of these, 160 + 10 papers (cited by others) were assessed for eligibility according to the PICOs. A total of 132 papers were considered eligible. Most of the research was focused on ovaries and testes, followed by urinary bladder and general articles about laparoscopy in horses. We identified 43 original studies (33%, RCT, NoRCT, and experimental trials), 39 case series/retrospective studies (29%), 37 case reports (28%), and 13 reviews (10%, narrative or systematic).

The effects of EOs with black pepper oil (BPO) or radish seed oil (RSO) on performance and the expression of digestive enzymes, lipogenesis, immunity, and autophagy-related genes in broiler chickens were explored. Six dietary treatments for 300 one-day-old chicks were allocated as follows: controls were fed a basal diet, one group was fed an EO-supplemented diet (1.5 g/kg diet of parsley, mint, and carrot seed oils (1:1:1)), and other groups received Eos + BPO0.25, Eos + BPO0.5, Eos + RSO0.25, and Eos + RSO0.5 treatments, with a basal diet containing EOs plus BPO or RSO at the level of 0.25 or 0.5 g/kg, respectively. Supplementation with 0.5 g/kg of EOs plus BPO or RSO resulted in the most improved maximum BWG and FCR in broiler chickens. The lactobacilli population was increased in Eos + BPO0.5, followed by EOs + RSO0.5, unlike in the control. The highest expression of the CCK and PNLIP genes was identified in the Eos + BPO group. The FAS and ACC genes were upregulated, while the IgA and IL-10 genes were downregulated, with EOs plus RSO or BPO. The group that received Eos + BPO0.5, followed by Eos + RSO0.5, displayed patterns of higher expression for atg5, atg7, and atg12, with lower expression of mTOR. In summary, a new combination of EOs with 0.5 g/kg BPO had potential growth-promoting and immune-boosting effects in broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

ND is predominantly caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. The objective of this study was to give an overview of different pathogens involved in ND in Germany. In 2017, a total number of 555 litters from 205 German pig farms with clinical ND were sampled with pooled fecal samples. All samples were analyzed regarding bacterial pathogens by culture and viral pathogens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Isolated strains of Clostridium (C.) perfringens, Escherichia (E.) coli, and C. difficile were further characterized by molecular techniques (e.g., PCR). There were 200 litters (36%), out of 555 sampled litters of 205 farms, which were positive for at least one, while most of them were positive for two or more pathogens. Toxin-producing C. perfringens type A could be detected in 122 farms (59.2%), C. difficile in 116 (56.1%), pathogenic E. coli in 79 (38.6%), and Rotavirus type A in 72 (35%). Among E. coli isolates, enterotoxigenic (8.8%) (F4 fimbriae positive (60.0%)) and necrotoxigenic E. coli (5.3%) were the most frequently detected pathotypes. In conclusion, in most of the farms with porcine ND it turned out to be a disease mainly caused by multiple pathogens, predominantly C. perfringens type A, pathogenic E. coli, and Rotavirus type A. Nevertheless, C. difficile and necrotoxigenic E. coli might be emerging pathogens in ND.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, the World Health Organization has proposed a classification of antimicrobials with respect to their importance for human medicine and advised some restriction of their use in veterinary medicine. In Belgium, this regulation has been implemented by a Royal Decree (RD) in 2016, which prohibits carbapenem use and enforces strict restrictions on the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (3 GC and 4 GC) for food-producing animals. Acquired resistance to &#946;-lactam antibiotics is most frequently mediated by the production of &#946;-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria. This study follows the resistance to &#946;-lactam antibiotics in Escherichia coli isolated from young diarrheic or septicaemic calves in Belgium over seven calving seasons in order to measure the impact of the RD. Phenotypic resistance to eight &#946;-lactams was assessed by disk diffusion assay and isolates were assigned to four resistance profiles: narrow-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (NSBL); extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBL); cephalosporinases (AmpC); and cephalosporinase-like, NSBL with cefoxitin resistance (AmpC-like). No carbapenemase-mediated resistance was detected. Different resistance rates were observed for each profile over the calving seasons. Following the RD, the number of susceptibility tests has increased, the resistance rate to 3 GC/4 GC has markedly decreased, while the observed resistance profiles have changed, with an increase in NSBL profiles in particular.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202299</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Feline Uveal Melanoma Review: Our Current Understanding and Recent Research Advances.</Title>	<Abstract>Melanocytic neoplasia is the most common form of ocular tumour in cats, accounting for 67% of cases in an analysis of 2614 cases of primary ocular neoplasia. Feline diffuse iris melanoma (FDIM) is by far the most common form of ocular melanocytic neoplasia, with limbal melanomas and atypical melanoma (melanoma affecting the choroid or ciliary body) infrequently recognised. Early lesions begin as flat areas of pigmentation of the iris, known as iris melanosis. This melanosis is a precursor lesion that can become FDIM when pigmented cells infiltrate the anterior iris stroma, commonly alongside a transition in cell morphology. The differentiation between FDIM and benign iris melanosis is only recognisable though histologic examination, with no in vivo means of identifying the malignant transformation. The behaviour of FDIM is variable and difficult to predict. Some FDIM lesions have a more benign progression and can slowly grow or remain static for years without affecting the ocular or systemic health of the individual, whilst other tumours behave aggressively, invading the ocular structures and significantly affecting the life expectancy of cats through metastatic disease. This makes management and timely enucleation of these cases challenging in practice. This article aims to review our current knowledge of FDIM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A seven-year-old intact Akita inu male dog presented with a red penile neoformation. It was further referred for a specialist andrological examination. During the visit, ultrasonography of genital apparatus and cytology of the penile lesion were performed. A suspected neoformation of vascular origin was observed on ultrasonography. Cytology was inconclusive as composition of the sample revealed blood elements only. The neoformation was surgically removed and the excised sample was submitted for the histological examination, which revealed an anomalous varicose dilatation of the venous vascular structures. In human medicine, varicose veins are part of the spectrum of chronic venous disease and include spider telangiectasia, reticular veins, and true varicosities. Reports of penile localization of varicose veins is rare in human medicine and, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been reported in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202301</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>In Vitro Neuroprotective Effect of the Bovine Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Mediated by Downregulation of IL-1&#946;, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 Expression.</Title>	<Abstract>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from human umbilical blood cord stem cells (HUBSC) are now being extensively utilized. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have the same ability as HUBSC as an option for autologous therapy. In addition, cell therapy using HUVECs may produce protective signals for cerebral vessels and promote neuronal survival after hypoxic-ischemic damage. HUVECs have the same anatomical and physiological structure as bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVECs). In this study, we aim to determine the ability of BUVEC-CM to reduce inflammation and apoptosis on in vitro neurodegeneration models (PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines). BUVEC-CM obtained from the third and fourth passages were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), while the other part was used as a treatment for in vitro model neurodegeneration. The PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines were cultured and grouped into seven different treatments, including untreated cells. As the treatment group, cells were given TMT 10 &#181;M in the presence of different doses of CM (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%); as a control comparison of recent therapy, donepezil was used. In addition, cells with the administration of TMT 10 &#181;M were run as a positive control. Cell viability assay (CCK-8) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to identify the viability and expression of interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), caspase-3, and caspase-9 for both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed that BUVEC-CM could significantly reduce IL-1&#946; expression and downregulate caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as when compared to the donepezil group. Taken together, these results indicate that BUVEC-CM can be used as a potential candidate for neuroprotective agents by reducing the activity of IL-1&#946; and the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells induced by TMT. However, further research still needs to be conducted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The clinical and biomolecular findings of the infection due to Cytauxzoon sp. and concomitant coinfections are described in three cats in central Italy. Three domestic cats were referred for different clinical conditions (impact trauma, lameness, and weight loss and lethargy). They presented different hematobiochemical profiles. Only two cats were anemic, but in all three cats, endo erythrocyte inclusions suggestive of piroplasmids were found at blood smear evaluation. EDTA blood samples were submitted to rapid ELISA test for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and to biomolecular investigations for Piroplasmida (Babesia spp., Theileria spp., Cytauxzoon spp.) and Mycoplasma spp. All three cats were positive for Cytauxzoon sp. (European Cytauxzoon species) and two cases were also coinfected by Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis and FIV. This report suggests that cytauxzoonosis should be included among differential diagnoses in subjects with possibility of contact with ticks and with presence of coinfections by tick-borne parasites, including in non-endemic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study is to describe and assess the efficacy of the methods implemented at the University of Le&#243;n (Spain) to adapt to lockdowns in the context of the Cytology and Histology (CH) course for veterinary medicine undergraduate students. To evaluate the success of lockdown-adapted methodologies, we used inferential statistical analysis to compare the academic outcomes of two cohorts: 2018-2019 (traditional face-to-face-presential-learning and evaluation) and 2019-2020 (some face-to-face and some online lockdown-adapted learning and online lockdown-adapted evaluation). This analysis considered scores in both theoretical and practical exams and students' final subject score. We also evaluated the number of logs onto the Moodle platform throughout the 2019-2020 period, as well as performing a student satisfaction survey in both courses. The use of explanatory pre-recorded lectures, continuous online self-assessment tests, and virtual microscopy (VM) may have produced significant improvements in the acquisition of histology competencies among students in the lockdown cohort. However, we need to implement further strategies to improve the assessment of students' true level of knowledge acquisition. According to the student feedback, VM is a well-accepted resource that is perceived as a flexible and enjoyable tool to use. However, while students found that the resource enhances their ability to learn about microscopic structures, they felt that it should not completely replace optical microscopy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fourteen horses were anaesthetised for elective procedures (anaesthetised group) and 10 horses were enrolled for standing blood pressure manipulation (standing group). In both groups, IBP and NIBP-corrected to heart level were measured every 3 min using the Bionet BM7Vet. The overall mean difference (bias), standard deviation and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated for paired IBP and NIBP systolic (SAP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DAP) blood pressure measurements. In anaesthetised horses, the NIBP cuff was placed at either the proximal tail base or the metacarpus. Invasive MAP was used to retrospectively characterise measurements into hypotensive (&#8804;70 mm Hg), normotensive (71-110 mm Hg) or hypertensive (&#8805;111 mm Hg) subgroups. In standing horses, the NIBP cuff was placed at the tail base only and invasive MAP was manipulated to achieve hypertension (&#8805;126 mm Hg) and hypotension (&#8804;90 mm Hg) using phenylephrine and acepromazine, respectively. When measuring NIBP at the tail in anaesthetised horses, the Bionet BM7Vet failed on 8/185 occasions and overestimated SAP, MAP and DAP during hypotension and normotension. The biases (lower, upper LOA) for MAP were -11.4 (-33.3, 10.5) and -6.0 (-25.8, 13.8) mm Hg, respectively. Hypertension could not be evaluated. When measuring NIBP at the metacarpus in anaesthetised horses, the Bionet BM7Vet failed on 24/65 occasions and underestimated SAP, MAP and DAP when all ABP subgroups were combined. The bias (lower, upper LOA) for pooled MAP was 3.6 (-44.3, 51.6) mm Hg. When measuring NIBP at the tail in standing horses, the Bionet BM7Vet failed on 64/268 occasions and underestimated SAP, MAP and DAP during hypotension, normotension and hypertension. The biases (lower, upper LOA) for MAP were 16.3 (-10.5, 43.1), 16.6 (-19.5, 52.7) and 30.0 (-8.1, 68.0) mm Hg, respectively. Monitoring NIBP on the Bionet BM7Vet in anaesthetised horses overestimated ABP at the tail and underestimated ABP at the metacarpus. The device inaccurately detected hypotension and should be used cautiously. In standing horses, the Bionet BM7Vet underestimated ABP at the tail, especially during pharmacologically induced hypertension.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been a component of Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine for many generations and is officially recognized in recorded history for treating equine disease in the Zhou Dynasty, circa 1050 BC. Drawing from a range of searchable databases, we present the use of veterinary acupuncture related to theriogenology. We touch on human-based medicine only as an introduction to current uses within veterinary medical acupuncture. This review is confined to the use of acupuncture encompassing dry needle, electroacupuncture, aquapuncture, and the few reports of laserpuncture. Starting with acupuncture's influence on the master organs of reproduction, the hypothalamus and the pituitary glands, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, we then review reports specific to the gonads-ovaries and testicles-and then its influences on the uterus. From there, we review reports on the influence of acupuncture on pain associated with reproductive surgery, and finally, on the use of acupuncture for maternal lactation. Based on published reports, we conclude that acupuncture has been shown to be effective in many situations as a treatment for infertility and/or reproductive tract disfunction, resulting in improvements in both female and male patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to control the disease a combination treatment of immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors was initiated. The mass showed a marked and sustained reduction in size, whilst preserving quality of life for the patient, with a survival at the time of writing of 15 months since diagnosis. This experience suggests that combination therapy for oral malignant melanoma using immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be successful in some patients and warrants further investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In North America, Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease and is caused by transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) from Ixodes spp. ticks to a diverse group of vertebrate hosts. Small mammal reservoir hosts are primarily responsible for maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l. across the United States. Nevertheless, birds can also be parasitized by ticks and are capable of infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. but their role in B. burgdorferi s.l. transmission dynamics is understudied. Birds could be important in both the maintenance and spread of B. burgdorferi s.l. and ticks because of their high mobility and shared habitat with important mammalian reservoir hosts. This study aims to better understand the role of avian hosts in tick-borne zoonotic disease transmission cycles in the western United States. We surveyed birds, mammals, and ticks at nine sites in northern California for B. burgdorferi s.l. infection and collected data on other metrics of host community composition such as abundance and diversity of birds, small mammals, lizards, predators, and ticks. We found 22.8% of birds infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and that the likelihood of avian B. burgdorferi s.l. infection was significantly associated with local host community composition and pathogen prevalence in California. Additionally, we found an average tick burden of 0.22 ticks per bird across all species. Predator and lizard abundances were significant predictors of avian tick infestation. These results indicate that birds are relevant hosts in the local B. burgdorferi s.l. transmission cycle in the western United States and quantifying their role in the spread and maintenance of Lyme disease requires further research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to detect mutant genes in digital melanoma. Paraffin-embedded samples from 86 canine digital melanomas were examined for the BRAF V595E variant by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), and for exon 11 mutations in c-kit. Furthermore, exons 2 and 3 of KRAS and NRAS were analysed by Sanger sequencing. Copy number variations (CNV) of KITLG in genomic DNA were analysed from nine dogs. The BRAF V595E variant was absent and in c-kit, a single nucleotide polymorphism was found in 16/70 tumours (23%). The number of copies of KITLG varied between 4 and 6. KRAS exon 2 codons 12 and 13 were mutated in 22/86 (25.6%) of the melanomas examined. Other mutually exclusive RAS mutations were found within the hotspot loci, i.e., KRAS exon 3 codon 61: 2/55 (3.6%); NRAS exon 2 codons 12 and 13: 2/83 (2.4%); and NRAS exon 3 codon 61: 9/86 (10.5%). However, no correlation could be established between histological malignancy criteria, survival times and the presence of RAS mutations. In summary, canine digital melanoma differs from molecular genetic data of canine oral melanoma and human melanoma, especially regarding the proportion of RAS mutations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Serum samples from 365 camels were examined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) test. (3) Results: Overall, the seroprevalence of anaplasmosis among camels was 18.6%. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, and it was discovered that tick infestation, application of acaricides, grooming practice and body condition were potential risk factors for Anaplasma spp. infection (odds ratio &gt; 1) in dromedary camels. In contrast, the locality in which the camels lived and their age were not significant effects with regard to the occurrence of anaplasmosis. (4) Conclusions: The current findings suggest that improvement of protective measures to limit the effects of the identified risk factors can help to reduce the spread of anaplasmosis among camels in Egypt.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202311</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>In Situ Hybridization of Feline Leukemia Virus in a Case of Osteochondromatosis.</Title>	<Abstract>Osteochondromatosis, also known as multiple cartilaginous exostosis, polyostotic osteochondroma, and multiple osteochondromas, comprises one-fifth of all primary bone tumors in cats, with no breed or sex predisposition or hereditary pattern. Unlike in dogs, horses, and humans, it is predominantly seen in young cats (2-4 years old), after the maturation of the skeleton. Although the pathogenesis of osteochondromatosis is not fully understood, it is considered to be related to infection by feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or other retroviruses, such as the feline sarcoma virus. However, the presence of viral particles within tumor lesions has only been demonstrated by electron microscopy. The malignant transformation of osteochondromas, most typically to osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, has also been attributed to the viral infection. Here we report the case of osteochondromatosis in a 3.5-year-old male domestic European shorthair cat with concurrent FeLV infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Viral RNA was visualized in representative tissues (spleen, mesenteric lymph node, liver, kidney, lung, brain) and in the osteochondromas with RNAscope in situ hybridization, which supports that FeLV infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteochondromatosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202312</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Translational Role of Animal Models for Estrogen-Related Functional Bladder Outlet Obstruction and Prostatic Inflammation.</Title>	<Abstract>The prevalence of LUTS and prostatic diseases increases with age both in humans and companion animals, suggesting that a common underlying cause of these conditions may be age-associated alterations in the balance of sex hormones. The symptoms are present with different and variable micturition dysfunctions and can be assigned to different clinical conditions including bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). LUTS may also be linked to chronic non-bacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), but the relationship between these conditions is unknown. This review summarizes the preclinical data that supports a role for excessive estrogen action in the development of obstructive voiding and nonbacterial prostatic inflammation. Preclinical studies that are emphasized in this review have unequivocally indicated that estrogens can induce functional and structural changes resembling those seen in human diseases. Recognizing excessive estrogen action as a possible hormonal basis for the effects observed at multiple sites in the LUT may inspire the development of innovative treatment options for human and animal patients with LUTS associated with functional BOO and CP/CPPS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202313</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Bovine Natural Antibody Relationships to Specific Antibodies and Fasciola hepatica Burdens after Experimental Infection and Vaccination with Glutathione S-Transferase.</Title>	<Abstract>Fasciola hepatica is the causative agent of fasciolosis, a significant parasitic disease occurring worldwide. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still no vaccine to control liver fluke infections in livestock. Recently, it has been suggested that natural antibodies (NAbs) can amplify specific antibodies (SpAb) and have a direct killing effect, but it is unknown if this phenomenon occurs during parasitic helminth infection or targeted vaccination. NAbs are antibodies produced by the innate immune system, capable of binding antigens without prior exposure. This study explores the role of bovine NAbs, using the exogenous glycoprotein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), in response to F. hepatica infection and SpAb production after infection and vaccination. The cattle's NAbs were differently influenced by parasite infection and vaccination, with an increase in KLH-binding IgG and IgM levels after infection and reduced KLH-binding IgM levels following vaccination. Underlying NAbs reacting to KLH showed no correlations to the final fluke burdens after experimental infection or vaccination. However, NAbs reacting to whole-worm extract (WWE) prior to infection were positively correlated to increased fluke burdens within the infected bovine host. Furthermore, after infection, the specific IgG reacting to WWE was positively reflected by the underlying NAb IgG response. Following subcutaneous vaccination with F. hepatica native glutathione S-transferase (GST), there was a non-significant 33% reduction in fluke burden. Vaccinated animals with higher underlying NAbs had a higher induction of vaccine-induced SpAbs, with trends observed between KLH-binding IgM and anti-GST IgG and IgM. Our findings provide a platform to allow further investigation to determine if NAb levels could mirror fluke-SpAb production for exploitation in a combined selective breeding and vaccination program. Additionally, this work suggests that liver fluke could possibly evade the host's immune system by utilising surface-bound IgM NAbs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of PS. This retrospective study evaluated the utility of clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in the prediction of PS severity. Data regarding heart murmur and ECG analysis were gathered. Ninety-seven dogs with PS were included. A murmur grade &#8805;IV/VI was predictive of severe PS (area under curve (AUC) = 0.71; sensitivity (Se) = 95%; specificity (Sp) = 33%; p = 0.003). In lead II, P wave amplitude &gt;0.35 mV (AUC = 0.67; Se = 31%; Sp = 100%; p = 0.038), Q wave &lt; 0.15 mV (AUC = 0.70; Se = 70%; Sp = 59%; p = 0.0015), R wave &lt; 0.87 mV (AUC = 0.66; Se = 67%; Sp = 69%; p = 0.006), and S wave &gt; 0.37 mV (AUC = 0.80; Se = 72%; Sp = 85%; p &lt; 0.0001) were predictive of severe PS. The extent of right deviation of the mean electrical axis of the QRS complex was correlated with the pulmonary pressure gradient (r = 0.648; p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, a systolic murmur with intensity &#8805;IV/VI, a P wave amplitude &gt;0.35 mV, low amplitude of Q and R waves, deep S waves in lead II, and right axis deviation of the QRS complex in a young dog are predictive of severe PS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Snakes play an important role in sparganosis transmission because they are the most common second intermediate hosts for Spirometra parasites. However, the population genetics of Spirometra isolates from snakes is currently not well studied in China. The present study was performed to explore the molecular characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of Spirometra tapeworms from different species of snakes in Hunan Province. This study obtained 49 Spirometra isolates from 15 geographical areas in Hunan Province, Central China. Subsequently, the 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments were amplified from the isolated parasites, and their sequences were analyzed to assess their genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm. The results showed that sequence variations among these isolates were 0-2.3% and 0-0.1% for 18S and 28S rDNA, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all Spirometra isolates from Hunan Province were clustered into the same branch with Spirometra erinaceieuropaei isolated from other areas (China, Vietnam, Australia). Moreover, the phylogenetic trees revealed that Spirometra is closely related to Adenocephalus, Pyramicocephalus, Ligula, Dibothriocephalus, Schistocephalus, and Diphyllobothrium. The Spirometra isolates of different hosts/regions in Hunan Province are not host segregated or geographically isolated, and support for the taxonomic status of Spirometra tapeworms in China has been added. These results provide reference values for future accurate identification and taxonomic status of Spirometra tapeworms in China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

BNP has a significant role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system and body fluid. The concentration of this hormone and of the biologically inactive amino-terminal-prohormone in the blood plasma is a helpful diagnostic tool for detecting cardiovascular diseases in human medicine and can be used as a prognostic marker for the risk of mortality, whilst such a tool does not exist for avian medicine. To date, the amino acid sequence of BNP is not known for many of the species commonly presented in avian consultation. In this study, the amino acid sequence of BNP and the prepropeptide was described for 12 parrot species as well as 3 raptor and 3 owl species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after RNA isolation from the heart. The results showed a high similarity between the amino acid sequences in the mature peptide region of the BNP. The prepropeptide showed several differences between the examined species, some of them shared by closely related species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the availability of urethral stents is limited by their high cost and the need for special equipment. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the construction and placement of an inexpensive temporary urethral stent and to report on its outcome in managing dogs with naturally occurring urethral disease. Temporary stents were placed in the urethra of 17 dogs with malignant and nonmalignant urethral pathologies. The most common indication for temporary stent placement was urethral obstruction. In this population, urethral patency was restored in all dogs. The most frequently reported complication was urinary incontinence. To manage this complication, dogs were diapered. Temporary urethral stents served as a durable and inexpensive alternative to expanding metallic stents. Because temporary stents were constructed from readily available materials and inserted without special equipment, practitioners capable of catheterizing the urethra can insert them on demand.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Surveillance and early warning systems effectively predict the emergence and re-emergence of arboviral disease. This paper presents the interim results of five years monitoring the exposure of sentinel na&#239;ve heifers and Culicoides biting midges (Diptera; Ceratopogonidae) to bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), Simbu serogroup viruses, bluetongue viruses (BTV), and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV). The data were collected from 11 dairy farms situated within eight different geographical regions in Israel. The results indicate that cattle in Israel are affected by all four viruses from the early summer onward. The investigated viruses exhibit unique site-specific profiles in both ruminants and vectors. The potential of several vectors to transmit these viruses and lack of cross-protection to re-infection with multiple serotypes (BTV and EHDV) or species (Simbu serogroup viruses) highlights some likely mechanisms that may play a role in these viruses' maintenance cycle and possible endemization in our region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202319</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Determining Heat Stress Effects of Multiple Genetic Traits in Tropical Dairy Cattle Using Single-Step Genomic BLUP.</Title>	<Abstract>Heat stress is becoming a significant problem in dairy farming, especially in tropical countries, making accurate genetic selection for heat tolerance a priority. This study investigated the effect of heat stress manifestation on genetics for milk yield, milk quality, and dairy health traits with and without genomic information using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) and BLUP in Thai-Holstein crossbred cows. The dataset contained 104,150 test-day records from the first lactation of 15,380 Thai-Holstein crossbred cows. A multiple-trait random regression test-day model on a temperature-humidity index (THI) function was used to estimate the genetic parameters and genetic values. Heat stress started at a THI of 76, and the heritability estimates ranged from moderate to low. The genetic correlation between those traits and heat stress in both BLUP methods was negative. The accuracy of genomic predictions in the ssGBLUP method was higher than the BLUP method. In conclusion, heat stress negatively impacted milk production, increased the somatic cell score, and disrupted the energy balance. Therefore, in dairy cattle genetic improvement programs, heat tolerance is an important trait. The new genetic evaluation method (ssGBLUP) should replace the traditional method (BLUP) for more accurate genetic selection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data were extracted and analyzed descriptively in terms of the frequency of bacterial species, susceptibility to antimicrobials and multidrug resistance.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 73 isolates were identified from 30 donkeys, of which 92% of the isolates were Gram-negative bacteria. Mixed cultures were found in 90% of the donkeys. The most common isolates were Escherichiacoli (31.5%) and Acinetobacter spp. (21.9%). Susceptibility testing revealed that amikacin (98%), cefoxitin (95%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (78%) and gentamicin (74%) were the most efficient agents for donkeys. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was found in 20% of all bacterial isolates, of which all Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates showed a multidrug resistance profile. Main limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which means a bias of selection may exist. The antimicrobial resistance and MDR of agents without break points were not calculated, which means the relative results may be underestimated in our study.</Abstract><Abstract>Severe infections were detected in donkeys with endometritis. Antimicrobial resistance and MDR bacteria are not rare in our study. This study demonstrated that bacteria identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are highly recommended before the treatment of uterine infections in donkeys. Further studies, including the epidemiological investigation of bacterial endometritis of donkeys, should be conducted to provide a better understanding of this critical problem.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202321</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>One Hundred Years of Coat Colour Influences on Genetic Diversity in the Process of Development of a Composite Horse Breed.</Title>	<Abstract>Genetic diversity and demographic parameters were computed to evaluate the historic effects of coat colour segregation in the process of configuration of the Hispano-Arabian horse (H&#225;). Pedigree records from 207,100 individuals born between 1884 and 2019 were used. Although coat colour is not a determinant for the admission of Hispano-Arabian individuals as apt for breeding, it may provide a representative visual insight into the gene contribution of Spanish Purebred horses (PRE), given many of the dilution genes described in H&#225; are not present in the Arabian Purebred breed (PR&#225;). The lack of consideration of coat colour inheritance patterns by the entities in charge of individual registration and the dodging behaviour of breeders towards the historic banning policies, may have acted as a buffer for diversity loss (lower than 8%). Inbreeding levels ranged from 1.81% in smokey cream horses to 8.80 for white horses. Contextually, crossbred breeding may increase the likelihood for double dilute combinations to occur as denoted by the increased number of H&#225; horses displaying Pearl coats (53 H&#225; against 3 PRE and 0 PR&#225;). Bans against certain coat colours and patterns may have prevented an appropriate registration of genealogical information from the 4th generation onwards for decades. This may have brought about the elongation of generation intervals. Breeder tastes may have returned to the formerly officially-recognised coat colours (Grey and Bay) and Chestnut/Sorrel. However, coat colour conditioning effects must be evaluated timely for relatively short specific periods, as these may describe cyclic patterns already described in owners' and breeders' tastes over the centuries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

EM is important for maintaining healthy ears because this process removes cerumen and debris. Therefore, increasing the rate of EM or TM regeneration could be very important for healthy ear maintenance and function. Stem cells or their conditioned media have been used in medical therapy in humans to increase the rate and efficacy of EM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of canine stem cell conditioned media to accelerate EM in canine TMs. Canine adipose tissue derived-mesenchymal stem cell conditioned media (cAD-MSCCM), and several cytokines related to keratinocyte growth or migration within the media were quantified using ELISA. Ink drops were placed on the TMs of four normal beagles. Then, cAD-MSCCM was applied weekly, a total of three times to the TMs of one ear, and nothing was applied to the other eye. The results showed a higher TM EM rate in the treatment group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). No adverse events were recorded. These results suggest that the weekly application of cAD-MSCCM accelerates the TM EM rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite many treatments suggested in the literature, only few studies reported comparative outcomes in the short and long term. The aim of this study is to report and compare short- and long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of dogs treated for medial compartment disease (MCD) by distal dynamic ulnar ostectomy (DUO), bi-oblique dynamic proximal ulnar osteotomy (BODPUO) and conservative management (CM). From 2016 to 2018, all medium to large dogs, aged between 5 and 12 months, affected by uni/bilateral MCD and treated by DUO, BODPUO or CM, were enrolled in this study and followed up for 24 months. Orthopedic and radiographic examinations were performed at T0, T2, T12 and T24 months after treatment. Lameness score, elbow arthralgia, elbow range of motion (ROM), osteoarthritis (OA) score and percentage of ulnar subtrochlear sclerosis (%STS) were evaluated at each time point. According to the treatment performed, dogs were divided into three groups: DUO, BODPUO and CM. Forty-five elbows from twenty-six dogs, treated with DUO (n = 17), BODPUO (n = 17) or CM (n = 11), were prospectively enrolled in the study. The patients enrolled in the CM group were older and showed more severe radiographic signs of OA, compared to those enrolled in the other two groups. Lameness and arthralgia scores (p &lt; 10[-4]) were significantly decreased in patients that underwent surgical treatment and increased in patients managed conservatively (lameness p &lt; 10[-4], arthralgia p = 0.3068), at T12 and T24. OA score (p &lt; 0.0040) and ROM (DUO, CM p &lt; 10[-4]; BODPUO p = 0.0740) worsened in every study group, but %STS decreased in DUO (p = 0.0108), increased in the CM group (p = 0.0025) and remained unchanged in the BODPUO group (p = 0.2740). This study supports the clinical efficacy of DUO and BODPUO in reducing lameness, arthralgia and progression of %STS. Early diagnosis and surgical attention in patients affected by MCD can improve the short- and long-term outcome and reduce the progression of secondary changes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Inspired by the One Health vision, Vet-OncoNet uses business intelligence tools to optimize the process of capturing, treating, and reporting animal cancer data to a national level in three interfaces: ACR (animal cancer registry, pathology-based), COR (clinical oncology registry, vet practice-based) and RFR (risk factor registry, owner-based). The first results show that skin and mammary gland are by far the most affected systems. Mast cell tumors and complex adenoma of the mammary gland are the most frequent histologic type in dogs, while in cats they are squamous cell carcinomas, tubular adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland and lymphomas. Regarding COR, it provides valuable information on the landscape of veterinary oncology practices, therapeutics options, outcomes and owners' drivers' adherence towards therapies, which range from 30% up to 80% upon vet practices. Furthermore, being aware of the role of animals within the family and as possible sentinels of environmental risks to cancer in humans, the network built an interface (Pet-OncoNet) dedicated to owners and a database (RFR) that receives information regarding pets and owners' daily habits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(2) Methods: The antibacterial effect of the total flavonoid against MRSA (ATCC43300) extracted from the Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. (A. pilosa Ledeb) was evaluated by the microdilution method. The oxidative stresses in MRSA were evaluated by the levels of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress-related genes. The DNA oxidative damage was tested by the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and DNA gel electrophoresis. The differentially expressed proteins were determined by the method of SDS-PAGE and NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, while the mRNAs of differential proteins were determined by Real-Time PCR. The changes of ultra-structures in MRSA were observed by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). (3) Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the total flavonoid against MRSA was recorded as 62.5 &#956;g/mL. After treatment with the total flavonoid, the levels of intracellular H2O2 and ROS were increased and the gene expressions against oxidative stress (SodA, katA, TrxB) were decreased (p &lt; 0.01), while the gene expression for oxidative stress (PerR) was increased (p &lt; 0.01). The level of intracellular 8-OHdG in MRSA was increased (p &lt; 0.01) and the DNA was damaged. The results of TEM also showed that the total flavonoid could destroy the ultra-structures in the bacteria. (4) Conclusions: The total flavonoid extracted from the A. pilosa Ledeb can induce the oxidative stress that disturbed the energy metabolism and protein synthesis in MRSA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This means that the ruminal condition of free-living and free-feeding wildlife remains practically unstudied. Urea nitrogen salvaging, a process by which urea is passed into the rumen, to both provide a valuable source of nitrogen for bacterial growth and to buffer the potentially harmful acidic effects of bacterial short chain fatty acids, has remained unexplored in wild ruminants, such as deer. UT-B2 transporters are the key proteins reported to facilitate the transepithelial ruminal urea transport. In this study, we investigate the expression, abundance and localisation of urea transporters in the rumen of a semi-wild fallow deer (Dama dama) population. Physical measurements confirmed that males had larger rumen than females, while adults had longer papillae than juveniles. Initial RT-PCR experiments confirmed the expression of UT-B2, while immunolocalisation studies revealed that strong UT-B staining was present in the stratum basale of deer rumen. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that a 50 kDa UT-B2 protein was significantly more abundant in adult females compared to adult males. This study confirms the presence of UT-B2 urea transporters in deer rumen and suggests that sex-related differences occur, bringing new insight into our understanding of rumen physiology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>35202328</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Stray Dogs and Public Health: Population Estimation in Punjab, India.</Title>	<Abstract>The overpopulation of stray dogs is a serious public health and animal welfare concern in India. Neglected zoonotic diseases such as rabies and echinococcosis are transmitted at the stray-dog human interface, particularly in low to middle-income countries. The current study was designed to estimate the stray dog populations in Punjab to enhance the implementation of animal birth and disease (for example, rabies vaccination) control programs. This is the first systematic estimation of the stray dog population using a recommended method (mark-re-sight) in Punjab, India. The study was conducted from August 2016 to November 2017 in selected villages or wards in Punjab. For the rural areas, 22 sub-districts in each district were randomly selected, then one village from each of the 22 selected sub-districts was selected (by convenience sampling). For urban areas, 3 towns (less than 100,000 human population) and 2 large cities (more than or equal to 100,000 human population) were randomly selected, followed by convenience selection of two wards from each of the 5 selected towns/cities. To estimate the dog population size, we used a modified mark-re-sight procedure and analysed counts using two methods; the Lincoln-Petersen formula with Chapman's correction, and an application of Good-Turing theory (SuperDuplicates method; estimated per km[2] and per 1000 adult humans and were compared between localities (villages vs. towns), dog sex (male vs. female) and age group (young vs. adult) using linear mixed models with district as a random effect. The predicted mean (95% CI) count of the dogs per village or ward were extrapolated to estimate the number of stray dogs in Punjab based on (a) the number of villages and wards in the state; (b) the adult human population of the state and (c) the built-up area of the state. Median stray dog populations per village and per ward using the Lincoln-Petersen formula with Chapman's correction were estimated to be 33 and 65 dogs, respectively. Higher estimates of 61 per village and 112 per ward are reported using the SuperDuplicates method. The number of males was significantly higher than the number of females and the number of adult dogs was about three times the number of young dogs. Based on different methods, estimates of the mean stray dog population in the state of Punjab ranged from 519,000 to 1,569,000. The current study revealed that there are a substantial number of stray dogs and a high number reside in rural (versus urban) areas in Punjab. The estimated stray dog numbers pose a potential public health hazard in Punjab. This impact requires assessment. The estimated stray dog numbers will help develop a dog population and rabies control program in which information about the logistics required as well as costs of implementing such programmes in Punjab can be incorporated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-four primiparous Saanen goats were supplemented with 0, 1, 2, and 4 g/d (per goat) of BBR in control (CON), BBR1, BBR2, and BBR4 groups (n = 6 per group), respectively, from 21 days before expected kidding to 21 days after parturition. Blood sampling was carried out at -21, -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to delivery. Colostrum was collected within the first and second milking (d 1 of lactation), and milk was harvested weekly after kidding. Both BBR2 and BBR4 increased dry matter intake (DMI) (p &#8804; 0.05) and energy balance (EB) as well as colostrum and milk production. Both BBR2 and BBR4 decreased (p &#8804; 0.05) plasma levels of cholesterol, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin, while elevating the plasma albumin and paraoxonase (p &#8804; 0.05), which may indicate that BBR mitigates inflammation during the transition period. BBR reduced (p &#8804; 0.05) malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased (p &#8804; 0.05) total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) in blood, colostrum, and milk. Concentrations of de novo fatty acid in colostrum and milk were increased (p &#8804; 0.05) with both BBR2 and BBR4. Free fatty acid (FFA) concentration in colostrum and milk fat were lower (p &#8804; 0.05) in BBR2 and BBR4 compared to CON. The concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in colostrum and milk fat increased (p &#8804; 0.05) with BBR2 and BBR4, while unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs) decreased (p &#8804; 0.05) in milk. In summary, supplementation with at least 2 g/d BBR may enhance the EB and antioxidant status of dairy goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35202330</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Adiponectin Influences FGF2 in the Developing Porcine Corpus Luteum.</Title>	<Abstract>Luteal angiogenesis is regulated by pro-angiogenic hormones including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), which are regulated by the adipokine leptin during development. Another adipokine, adiponectin, exhibits an inverse relationship with leptin and has been identified in the CL. Therefore, it is hypothesized that adiponectin will influence pro-angiogenic hormones in the developing porcine CL. Crossbred sows were randomly allocated to one of two days of the estrous cycle, day 5 (D5; n = 4) or day 7 (D7; n = 5) for CL collection. Tissue was processed for immunohistochemical localization of adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), gene expression of FGF2, Ang1, leptin, AdipoR2, and cell culture for adiponectin treatment. The expression of AdipoR2 tended (p = 0.09) to be higher in D7 lutea and was more prevalently localized to the cell surface of large and small luteal cells than in D5 tissue. Adiponectin influenced (p &#8804; 0.05) FGF2, leptin, and AdipoR2 gene expression relative to the dose and day (D5 or D7). Collectively, the evidence supports the supposition that adiponectin influences angiogenic factors in the developing CL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, for the most commonly used anticoagulants, EDTA and heparin, varying effects on blood components have been reported in different species. As little is known about the impact of anticoagulants on the immunological evaluation of camel leukocytes, the present study analyzed the leukogram, the immunophenotype, and the cell vitality of camel leukocytes separated from blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA or lithium heparin. Using flow cytometry and staining with monoclonal antibodies to several cell surface markers, the composition and immunophenotype of camel leukocytes separated from blood anticoagulated with EDTA or heparin were analyzed. In comparison to EDTA-anticoagulated blood, using lithium heparin as an anticoagulant resulted in reduced numbers of total leukocytes and reduced numbers of neutrophils, which led to a reduced neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. The analysis of cell necrosis and apoptosis after the staining of leukocytes with the DNA-sensitive dye propidium iodide and the mitochondrial membrane potential probe JC1 revealed a higher fraction of necrotic neutrophils and higher fractions of apoptotic neutrophils and monocytes in heparin blood than in EDTA blood. In addition, monocytes from heparin blood showed higher expression levels of the cell surface markers CD14, CD163, and MHCII when compared to cells from EDTA blood. Similarly, in heparin blood, CD44 and CD172a were expressed higher on neutrophils, while CD11a was expressed higher on lymphocytes in comparison to cells from EDTA blood. The results of the current study indicate the importance of considering the type of anticoagulant when investigating the composition, vitality, and immunophenotype of camel leukocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Staphylococcus spp., opportunistic pathogens present in the skin and mucosa of mammals, have had their importance recognized in human and veterinary medicine. The objectives of this study were to identify Staphylococcus spp. present in isolates from the nostrils of healthy humans, dogs and cats as well as to determine their phenotype of resistance to methicillin. Strain identification was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using a disk diffusion assay for 12 antibiotics. Sixty humans (veterinary and technicians), sixty dogs and sixty cats were sampled; of them, 61.6%, 56.6% and 46.6%, respectively, carried Staphylococcus spp. in their nostrils, and only two people carried two different species of Staphylococcus in the only anatomical site sampled. A methicillin-resistant phenotype was present in 48.7% of the humans, 26.5% of the dogs and 57.1% of the cats, and sampled. These results demonstrate the presence of Staphylococcus spp. strains resistant to methicillin in personnel who work in contact with animals, as well as in dogs and cats that entered the same hospital or veterinary clinic, which alerts us to the potential transfer of these strains to or between people, dogs and/or cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, little epidemiological data of PRRSV and PCV2 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were available. This pilot study aimed to provide baseline information of the prevalences of PPRSV and PCV2 in the HKSAR. A complex survey was conducted from 3 February 2020 to 11 March 2021 on 29 of the 40 pig farms in the HKSAR, with five pigs each from seven age groups (representing key production stages) tested using a real-time PCR. Evidence of presence of PRRSV European strain (PRRSV-1), PRRSV North American strain (PRRSV-2) and PCV2 was confirmed on 48%, 86% and 79% of farms, with overall prevalences of 7.6% (95% CI: 4.8-10.3%), 12.2% (95% CI: 9.6-14.7%) and 20.3% (95% CI: 14.3-26.2%) in the HKSAR pig population based on pooling results from all pigs across all farms. PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 were more prevalent in younger pigs, with the highest prevalences of 32.1% (95% CI: 20.8-45.0%) and 51.5% (95% CI: 38.9-64.0%) for 8-week-old pigs. In contrast, the distribution of PCV2 prevalence across age groups appeared to be more symmetrical, with higher prevalences reported in pigs from 12 weeks old to 24 weeks old but lower prevalences in younger pigs and sows. The results of this study demonstrate that PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2 and PCV2 are widely spread across pig farms in the HKSAR, which indicates that the current farm management and control protocols should be improved. We recommend the implementation of on-farm intervention strategies combined with ongoing surveillance to reduce these viruses, and their consequences, in the HKSAR pig population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite its veterinary importance, no previous studies investigated the occurrence of this virus in Egypt. In the present work, a total number of one hundred forty (N = 140) conjunctival and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic cats during veterinary clinic visits located in two Egyptian provinces. Virus isolation was performed in the Chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of 12-days-old SPF eggs. Interestingly, the embryos showed stunting growth and abnormal feathering and infected CAMs showed edematous thickening and cloudiness with characteristic white opaque pock lesions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the thymidine kinase gene (TK) was successful in 16/140 (11.4%) of the suspected cases. Two of the amplified genes were sequenced and the TK gene sequences of the FHV-1 isolates were highly similar to other reference strains in the GenBank database. Given the above information, the present study represents the first report of feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) in domestic cats in Egypt. Further studies on the causes of upper respiratory tract infections in cats as well as vaccine efficacy are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial roles in human breast tumor initiation and progression, but the role of lncRNAs in canine mammary tumors is unclear. We analyzed the expression profiles of canine mammary tumors and their adjacent non-neoplastic tissue to explore abnormally expressed lncRNAs. LncRNA expression was detected by qRT-PCR. After overexpression of lnc40589 and knockdown of lnc34977 in CMT cells, CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays were used to assess the proliferation, migration and invasive ability of canine mammary tumor cells. We also established a mammary tumor-bearing nude mouse model. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were closely related to the mammary tumor. lnc40589 was significantly upregulated and lnc34977 was significantly downregulated in CMTs. In addition, lnc40589 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while lnc34977 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, lnc34977 promotes the development of mammary tumors in animals. Taken together, our study results reveal the lncRNA expression profiles in CMTs and indicate that lnc34977 promotes the development of CMT both in cell culture and in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This work reports, for the first time in Sicily (South Italy), an outbreak of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona that occurred in cattle farms within the Nebrodi Park and was mainly characterized by full-term abortion. Blood and urine samples were collected at different time points from animals of six different farms (Farms A-F) sharing the same grazing area. Research of antibodies against pathogenic Leptospira species in serum samples was carried out via Micro Agglutination Test (MAT). Urine samples were subjected to pathogen isolation and molecular analyses via TaqMan Real Time-PCR. Genotyping of Leptospira species was obtained by Multi-locus sequence typing. MAT detected antibodies against Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona in serum samples of all the farms. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. DNA and culture isolation was obtained from urine samples. Genotyping confirmed the excretion of L. interrogans serogroup Pomona. This study describes clinical manifestations, diagnostic implications and epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak in cattle due to L. interrogans Pomona in a protected multi-host area, where domestic and wild animals share the same habitat, suggesting a role of wild species in transmission and persistence of Pomona serogroup among cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-five cats with International Renal Interest Society Stage 1-4 CKD and 16 healthy mature adult and senior client-owned cats were included in this prospective cross-sectional study. Sera were analyzed for 25 AA concentrations using an ion exchange chromatography AA analyzer with post column ninhydrin derivatization. Voided fecal samples were analyzed for 22 AA concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. CKD cats had lower serum concentrations of phenylalanine (mean difference &#177; standard error of the mean: 12.7 &#177; 4.3 &#181;M; p = 0.03), threonine (29.6 &#177; 9.2 &#181;M; p = 0.03), tryptophan (18.4 &#177; 5.4 &#181;M; p = 0.005), serine (29.8 &#177; 12.6 &#181;M; p = 0.03), and tyrosine (11.6 &#177; 3.8 &#181;M; p = 0.01) and higher serum concentrations of aspartic acid (4.7 &#177; 2.0 &#181;M; p = 0.01), &#946;-alanine (3.4 &#177; 1.2 &#181;M; p = 0.01), citrulline (5.7 &#177; 1.6 &#181;M; p = 0.01), and taurine (109.9 &#177; 29.6 &#181;M; p = 0.01) when compared to healthy cats. Fecal AA concentrations did not differ between healthy cats and CKD cats. 3-Methylhistidine-to-creatinine did not differ between healthy cats with and without muscle loss.

<Rec><Common><PMID>35202338</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Rodent-Human Interface: Behavioral Risk Factors and Leptospirosis in a Province in the Central Region of Thailand.</Title>	<Abstract>This sequential explanatory mixed-method study consisted of analytical, cross-sectional, and qualitative studies. The research was conducted in the Khao Nor and Khao Kaew areas of the Banphot Pisai districts of Nakhon Sawan Province in 2019. Here, we examined the rodent contact characteristics of villagers in these areas and determined the potential characteristics/risk factors associated with rodents using a semi-structured questionnaire, key informant interview (KII), and focus group discussion (FGD). Results of the quantitative study (N1 = 372) characterized participants that contacted rodents per gender, age, occupation, knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP), including their cultural contexts, and beliefs. Ninety participants (24.2%) reported contact with rodents, and the reasons for their direct physical rodent contact were hunting (35, 9.4%), killing (41, 11.0%), preparing rodents as food (33, 8.9%), consuming cooked meats (12, 3.2%), feeding food (4, 1.1%), cleaning feces (17, 4.6%), and cleaning carcasses (33, 8.9%). Moreover, logistic regression results showed that males encountering rodents were statistically significant (Adjusted OR = 3.137, 95% CI 1.914-5.139, p &lt; 0.001). Low monthly household income (&lt;THB 15,000 or &lt;USD 450) was also negatively statistically significant with encountering rodents (Adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.99, p = 0.04). Additionally, the villagers had a low level of knowledge toward zoonotic diseases and inappropriate attitudes and practices toward contacting rodents and zoonotic diseases. Thirty-five qualitative study participants (N2) participated in the KIIs and FGDs. Various rodent contact activities were also reported among the qualitative research participants, such as hunting, consumption, and selling them to their friends and neighbors. However, these rodents also destroyed their belongings, crops, and plants. Some participants also reported that rodents accounted for leptospirosis transmission. As a result, communication intervention should be planned to provide appropriate knowledge and attitude to the villagers, especially among those who have close contact with rodents in the understudied area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 3-year age Chios ram had an abnormally enlarged scrotal area, was excluded from reproductive duties, and was euthanized with the owners' permission. The main pathological finding was the presence of bilateral multinodular spermatic cord enlargement with laminated vascular thrombi. Histopathological examination revealed commonly mineralized thrombi within the lumen of veins of the pampiniform plexus, inflammation and testicular degeneration. The epididymides were transported to the laboratory and each cauda region was sliced and washed (8 mL water for injection/epididymis), and the epididymal sperm samples were collected. Sperm motility variables (CASA), viability (eosin-nigrosine), morphology (SpermBlue[&#174;]), and DNA integrity (Acridine Orange Test, AOT) were assessed. The total and progressive motility were low in semen samples of both sides (30.00% and 1.00% vs. 42.60% and 2.50% for left and right epididymis, respectively). Low viability values were observed for both sides (26.00% vs. 23.00% for left and right epididymis, respectively), while sperm morphological abnormalities were within normal limits. No sperm with DNA damage were detected. The results of this case report indicate that varicocele is associated with testis dysfunction and degradation of ram semen quality, mainly affecting motility and kinematics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Canids are the main definitive host for this parasite and the presence of dogs in the farm is an important factor for the Neospora caninum infection in bovines. Since, in the province of Lecce, located in the Apulia region of Southern Italy, there are no studies showing the presence of the infection in farm animals, the objective was to perform a serological evaluation for anti-N. caninum antibodiesin serum from 706 dairy cattle and 21 farm dogs located in 40 farms uniformlydistributed over the territory.The presence of N. caninum infection was confirmed in 90.0% (36/40) of the 40 farms examined. The results obtained on all serum samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID Screen[&#174;]Neospora caninum competition ELISA kit) for anti-N. caninum antibodies showed a seropositivity rate of 21.1% (149/706) among dairy cows, with a statistically significant higher percentage of positive subjects in the animals over two years old and a positivity rate of 42.9% (9/21) in tested dogs. The obtained data confirmed the presence of neosporosis even in the Lecce area, where it could therefore represent an important cause of abortion and economic losses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Presently, acupuncture is widely used as an alternative treatment which was shown to bring about positive effects in the treatment of human respiratory diseases. The present study demonstrated the effect of acupuncture on tracheal collapse dogs. We hypothesized that acupuncture can help dogs suffering from tracheal collapse by improving various parameters including heart rate variability, serum biomarkers for oxidative stress, exercise performance, and quality of life. Twenty client-owned dogs from small breeds with tracheal collapse disease were enrolled. The study was divided into two 5-week periods. During the first period, the dogs received normal veterinary care but received no acupuncture treatment (NAC). After completing that period, all forms of treatment were withheld for one week before the beginning of the second period. In the second period, all dogs restarted normal veterinary care and underwent acupuncture treatment (AC) once a week for five consecutive weeks. Blood was collected at the beginning and end of each of the two periods for malondialdehyde (MDA) level measurement. Heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded at the 1st, 3rd and 5th weeks of both periods. Exercise tests were performed at the beginning and end of AC period and questionnaire interviews with the owners were accomplished at the end of each period. The results showed that acupuncture can alleviate clinical signs of tracheal collapse, reduce MDA level, and improve sympathovagal balance. We suggest that acupuncture treatment could be used as an adjunct treatment for canine tracheal collapse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This disorder causes impairment in daily function and significant distress. A potential animal model for this disorder is the inbred C57BL/6J mouse which displays clinical signs and behavioral characteristics similar to those described for people affected by this disorder. Because alcohol-preferring P rats also display similar clinical signs and behavioral characteristics, it was hypothesized that this selectively bred stock could be an additional animal model. In this study, 112 female P rats were recorded on digital media for 15 min after being sprayed with a mist of water and assessed for grooming patterns-oral, manual, and scratching. Significant elevations in scratching and oral grooming behavior were predictive of the future development of skin lesions. These findings suggest that P rats may be an additional model to study TTM, with the advantage of increased genetic variation (i.e., non-inbred) which mirrors the human population. The use of this model may help to identify preventative and therapeutic interventions for humans and other animals with similar body-focused repetitive disorders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pig units (n = 31) were surveyed on needle reuse and injection practices, and these findings informed subsequent laboratory-based experiments on needle puncture force into piglet cadaver tissues. A 21 G 5/8" needle was reported as the most used needle type (67.7%), with 80.6% reporting needle reuse; 38.7% changed the needle between litters or earlier if damaged, 16.1% every three litters and 22.5% when it felt blunt or damaged, after each injection session or when changing the bottle of iron solution. There was a significant difference in puncture force between the 1st and 36th use (p &lt; 0.05), and between the 1st and 100th use (p = 0.0015), but not between the 1st and 12th or 36th use (p &gt; 0.999 and p = 0.8313, respectively). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging showed appreciable damage to the needle tip after 12 uses. The repeat use of needles in piglet cadavers increased the force of needle puncture compared to first-time use. When extrapolated to live animals, the use of blunt needles has the potential to cause pain and distress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since there are no molecular Cryptosporidium spp. infection data in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from Spain, our aim was to gather information about this parasite in wild European rabbits from Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain). A total of 100 faecal samples were collected from rabbits from eight municipalities of Tenerife. Microscopic analysis showed that 4.0% of the samples presented structures compatible with Cryptosporidium oocyst. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragments was carried out, and sequencing confirmed the identity of C. cuniculus in one sample (1.0%). The sample was successfully subtyped using nested PCR analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene as the subtype VbA26R3. This study confirms the presence of C. cuniculus in wild rabbits from Tenerife, providing new information on the occurrence of this zoonotic parasite. Further studies are required to better understand the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rabbits in Spain and their possible public health repercussions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro potential of 11 essential oils (EOs) and one binary combination of isolated EO compounds, as well as the in vivo anthelmintic efficacy of two EO formulations. Four GIN genera were identified in the coproculture examination: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia and Chabertia. The in vitro egg hatch test (EHT) was performed at six different concentrations (50, 12.5, 3.125, 0.781, 0.195 and 0.049 mg/mL) for each EO, whereas in the in vivo faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), each EO sample was diluted in sunflower oil and orally administrated at a dose of 100 mg/kg to the different group of animals. In the EHT, the EOs of Origanum vulgare, Foeniculum vulgare, Satureja montana, Satureja hortensis and two types of Thymus vulgaris were the most effective. The dominant compounds of these EOs were carvacrol, thymol, anethol, p-cymene and &#947;-terpinene, indicating their importance for the anthelmintic activity. In the FECRT, both T. vulgaris EO type 1 and linalool:estragole combination show an anthelmintic potential with a mean effect on FECR of approximately 25%. The results suggest the possible role of tested EOs as anthelmintic agents in sheep farms, although further in vivo tests are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential proteins throughout EMN stages from faecal proteomic outlining using functional analysis. Faecal samples were collected from the rectum of 25 grey horses divided into three groups; normal group without EMN (n = 10), mild EMN (n = 6) and severe EMN (n = 9). Based on the results, 5910 annotated proteins out of 8509 total proteins were assessed from proteomic profiling. We observed differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the normal group and the EMN group, and 109 significant proteins were obtained, of which 28 and 81 were involved in metabolic and non-metabolic functions, respectively. We found 10 proteins that play a key role in lipid metabolism, affecting the tumour microenvironment and, consequently, melanoma progression. Interestingly, FOSL1 (FOS like 1, AP-1 transcription factor subunit) was considered as a potential highly expressed protein in a mild EMN group involved in melanocytes cell and related melanoma. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGKB), TGc domain-containing protein (Tgm2), structural maintenance of chromosomes 4 (SMC4) and mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 2 (MAML2) were related to lipid metabolism, facilitating melanoma development in the severe-EMN group. In conclusion, these potential proteins can be used as candidate biomarkers for the monitoring of early EMN, the development of EMN, further prevention and treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One promising alternative to the use of chemicals is entomopathogenic organisms that are environmentally friendly and are capable of stopping the expression of resistance once it has evolved. In the recent past, the scientific community has carried out several experiments addressing the use of microbiological control agents. In particular, experimental studies using entomopathogenic fungi have had more success in honey bee research. With their adherence properties and their ability to digest the cuticle and overcome the host defense mechanism, they could be a suitable ingredient in bioacaricides. Several promising fungi have been identified in the search for effective means to control pest populations. The data obtained from the different experiments are interesting and often favorable to their use, but there are also conflicting results.

The tumor developed in the right humeral diaphysis, one of the sites of polyostotic osteomyelitis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of polyostotic osteomyelitis caused by Serratia liquefaciens in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324825</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Isotretinoin Treatment for Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis in a Golden Retriever.</Title>	<Abstract>Ichthyoses are hereditary cornification disorders that manifest with abnormal differentiation and desquamation of keratinocytes in a form of generalized dry and scaly skin. In golden retriever dogs, autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) has been associated with mutations in the PNPLA 1 gene. In human medicine, isotretinoin is frequently used to treat ARCIs. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and histological effects of isotretinoin on ARCI in a golden retriever dog with confirmed mutation in the PNPLA 1 gene. Clinical examination, blood analysis and histopathological examinations were conducted before and after 90 days of isotretinoin therapy. The clinical and histopathological findings indicate that treatment with oral isotretinoin was effective in improving ichthyosis without any side-effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nowadays, antibiotics are mainly used to prevent and control poultry colibacillosis, but the situation of drug resistance is serious. 5&#8242;-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (Pfs) is involved in methylation reactions, polyamine synthesis, vitamin synthesis, and quorum sensing (QS) pathways. In this study, compared with the APEC wild-type strain DE17, the pfs deletion strain DE17&#916;pfs was more susceptible to &#946;-lactam antibiotics (amoxicillin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime) by drug sensitivity test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the MIC of the DE17&#916;pfs was half that of the DE17. Quorum sensing signal molecule AI-2 is involved in antibiotic resistance. In the case of pfs inactivation, the DE17&#916;pfs cannot synthesize AI-2, so it is necessary to add AI-2 to study whether it affects APEC resistance. When the exogenous AI-2 was added, the MIC of all APEC did not change. Transcriptome sequencing indicated that the transcription levels of a lot of outer membrane protein genes and metabolic genes had changed due to the deletion of pfs. Moreover, the transcription levels of the efflux pump gene tolC and penicillin binding protein (fstI and mrcA) were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05), while the transcription levels of the porin protein genes (ompF, ompC, and ompD) were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, it was also found that the outer membrane permeability of the DE17&#916;pfs was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). The results indicated that pfs does not affect APEC strain DE17 resistance to &#946;-lactam antibiotics through AI-2, but pfs affects the sensitivity of APEC to &#946;-lactam antibiotics by affecting antibiotic-related genes. This study can provide a reference for screening new drug targets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In those animals affected by E. coli driven LPS-mediated infections, fertility problems occur in part due to disrupted follicular and luteal functionality. However, the molecular mechanisms by which LPS induces inflammation, and specifically, the role of LPS in the disruption of capillary morphogenesis and endothelial barrier function remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that LPS may lead to alterations in luteal angiogenesis and vascular function by inducing inflammatory reactions in endothelial cells. Accordingly, OLENDO cells were treated with LPS followed by evaluation of the expression of selected representative proinflammatory cytokines: NF-kB, IL6, IL8, TNF&#945;, and ICAM 1. While TNF&#945; was not affected by treatment with LPS, transcripts of NF-kB, IL6, and IL8 were affected in a dosage-dependent manner. Additionally, the activity of TLR2 and TLR4 was blocked, resulting in suppression of the LPS-induced expression of ICAM 1, NF-kB, IL6, and IL8. Inhibition of the PKA or MAPK/ERK pathways suppressed the LPS-stimulated expression of NF-kB, IL6, and IL8, whereas blocking the PKC pathway had the opposite effect. Furthermore, LPS-induced phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 was inhibited when the TLR4 or MAPK/ERK pathways were blocked. Finally, LPS seems to induce inflammatory processes in OLENDO cells via TLR2 and TLR4, utilizing different signaling pathways.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the crosstalk between this virus and its host cells in related signaling pathways remains poorly understood. In this study, the expression profiles of 84 genes involved in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) signaling pathway were probed in PCV2b-infected primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by using an RT[2] profiler PCR array system. The protein expression levels of cytokines involved in the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway were determined with a RayBiotech fluorescent Quantibody[&#174;] porcine cytokine array system. Results showed that 48, 30, and 42 genes were differentially expressed at 1, 24, and 48 h after infection, respectively. A large number of genes analyzed by a co-expression network and implicated in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis were differentially expressed in PCV2b-infected PAMs. Among these genes, TGF-&#946;, interleukin-10, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPB), growth arrest, and DNA-damage-inducible 45 beta (GADD45B), and BCL2 were upregulated. By contrast, SMAD family member 1 (smad1) and smad3 were downregulated. These results suggested that the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway was repressed in PAMs at the early onset of PCV2 infection. The inhibited apoptosis was indicated by the upregulated C/EBPB, GADD45B, and BCL2, and by the downregulated smad1 and smad3, which possibly increased the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions and caused a persistent infection. Our study may provide insights into the underlying antiviral functional changes in the immune system of PCV2-infected pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cervids, along with wild boars and lagomorphs, are the main wild hosts of HEV in Europe and constitute a documented source of infection for humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of HEV in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) living in Tuscany, Central Italy. Liver samples from 48 roe deer and 60 fallow deer were collected from carcasses during the hunting seasons. Following the results obtained from molecular and histopathologic studies, 5/48 (10.4%) roe deer and 1/60 (1.7%) fallow deer liver samples were positive for the presence of HEV RNA. All PCR-positive livers were also IHC-positive for viral antigen presence, associated with degenerative and inflammatory lesions with predominantly CD3+ cellular infiltrates. This study represents the first identification in Italy of HEV RNA in roe and fallow deer and the first study in literature describing liver alterations associated with HEV infection in cervids. These results demonstrate that HEV is present in wild cervid populations in Italy and confirm the potential zoonotic role of these species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The antibody response was measured before vaccination by serum samples with two C. burnetii phase-specific ELISAs to characterize the disease status. Shedding was determined by vaginal swabs during three kidding seasons and monthly bulk tank milk (BTM) samples. Dust swabs from one windowsill of each barn and from the milking parlors were collected monthly to evaluate the indoor exposure. These samples were analyzed by qPCR. The phase-specific serology revealed an acute Q fever infection in herd A, whereas herds B and C had an ongoing and past infection, respectively. In all three herds, vaginal shedders were present during three kidding seasons. In total, 50%, 69%, and 15% of all collected BTM samples were C. burnetii positive in herds A, B, and C, respectively. Barn dust contained C. burnetii DNA in 71%, 45%, and 50% of examined swabs collected from farms A, B, and C, respectively. The largest number of C. burnetii positive samples was obtained from the milking parlor (A: 91%, B: 72%, C: 73%), indicating a high risk for humans to acquire Q fever during milking activity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Conventional analytical approaches for mycotoxin identification include thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography (GC). Rapid methods for mycotoxin analysis are also becoming increasingly relevant. One of the most common rapid methods for determining these compounds is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The current study aimed to compare three available ELISA kits for the detection and quantification of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in spiked feed samples at known quantities. All three ELISA kits were validated and showed good performance with high recovery rates and LOD and LOQ values lower than the MRL. The developed HPLC-FL method was validated for all the compounds determining the accuracy, precision, linearity, decision limit, and detection capability with fairly good results. Unknown feed samples (corn, silage, pellet, barley, wheat, soya, and sunflower) were also tested using the best ELISA kit and HPLC, and the results were compared. Both ELISA and HPLC were proven to be suitable methods for mycotoxin analysis. The analytical technique should be determined primarily by the availability and number of samples.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was designed to evaluate the impact of dietary cereal type (wheat-based (WB) vs. maize-based (MB) diets), crude protein level (normal (NP) vs. lowered (LP)), and sodium (n-)butyrate (1.5 g/kg diet) supplementation (vs. no butyrate) on the responsiveness of hepatic glucagon receptor (GCGR), insulin receptor beta (IR&#946;) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the phase of intensive growth of chickens. Liver samples of Ross 308 broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were collected on day 21 for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Hepatic GCGR and mTOR gene expressions were up-regulated by WB and LP diet. GCGR and IR&#946; protein level decreased in groups with butyrate supplementation; however, the quantity of IR&#946; and mTOR protein increased in WB groups. Based on these data, the applied dietary strategies may be useful tools to modulate hepatic insulin and glucagon signaling of chickens in the period of intensive growth. The obtained results might contribute to the better understanding of glycemic control of birds and increase the opportunity of ameliorating insulin sensitivity, hence, improving the production parameters and the welfare of broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess lesions of the carotid artery in Indonesian cynomolgus monkeys exposed to an IPB-1 atherogenic diet. A total of 20 adult male cynomolgus monkeys received the local IPB-1 diet for two years. Blood lipid profiles, morphology, and carotid ultrasound of monkeys were measured. Nine of them were euthanized to confirm atherosclerotic lesions. Common carotid arteries (CCA) and carotid bifurcation (BIF) samples were collected and stained using Verhoef-van Giessen and CD68 immunohistochemistry. The results reveal the presence of severe atherosclerosis plaques in six out of nine animals (66.7%) corresponding to intermediately and hyper-responsive groups. The hyper-responsive group displayed the highest response in the developing intimal area (IA) at the CCA (0.821 mm[2]), whereas the hyporesponsive group had the smallest IA (0.045 mm[2]) (p = 0.0001). At the BIF, the hyporesponsive group showed the smallest IA (p = 0.001), but there was no difference between the intermediately and hyper-responsive groups (p = 0.312). The macrophage marker CD68 was also expressed on the cartotid of the intermediately and hyper-responsive groups. These results indicate that severe atherosclerotic lesions with high infiltration of macrophages were formed in the carotid arteries of intermediately and hyper-responsive Indonesian cynomolgus monkeys fed with the local atherogenic diet IPB-1 over two years, thus confirming atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324834</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Xenotransfusion of Blood from Dog to Cat: Should Canine Blood Be Our First Choice for Feline Transfusion in Emergency Situations?</Title>	<Abstract>Despite the ability to determine feline blood types, the transfusion of canine blood to cats is still practiced in some countries. Xenotransfusion is effective-even if its effects only last for a few days-and is not associated with serious adverse effects. It avoids the need for blood typing, and most importantly, it avoids the transmission of intraspecific infectious agents, notably the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Transfusion with canine blood is easier, quicker and less costly than transfusion with feline blood; it is less disagreeable for the donor. In the light of these arguments, when feline blood collected according to current guidelines is not available, in particular when the donor is not confirmed to be negative for the FeLV provirus, the authors consider it to be judicious to use canine blood for feline transfusion in emergency situations; this practice is preferable to inaction and to the inoculation of an infectious agent. Allotransfusion remains preferable in non-emergency situations as a treatment of chronic compensated anaemiae or if an appropriate donor (negative for FeLV provirus) is available. However, 2-4 days after a xenotransfusion, if a clinical alteration and a significant decrease in haematocrit are observed, a transfusion with cat's blood confirmed to be negative for FeLV provirus should be performed. Xenotransfusion should never be used twice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bladder cancer in companion animals shows a complex and still poorly understood biopathology, and this lack of knowledge has limited therapeutic progress over the years. Even so, important advances concerning the identification of tumour markers with clinical applications at the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic levels have recently been made, for example, the identification of pathological BRAF mutations. Those advances are now facilitating the introduction of targeted therapies. The present review will address such advances, focusing on small animal oncology and providing the reader with an update on this field. When appropriate, comparisons will be drawn with bladder cancer in human patients, as well as with experimental models of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of Campylobacter and the antimicrobial resistance in layer hens and on eggshells. Thus, 366 cloacal swabs and 86 eggshell smear samples were collected from five layer hen farms in the North-East of Tunisia. The occurrence of Campylobacter infection, and the antimicrobial resistance rates and patterns, were analyzed. The occurrence rates of Campylobacter infection in laying hens and eggshells were 42.3% and 25.6%, respectively, with a predominance of C. jejuni (68.4%, 81.9%), followed by C. coli (31.6%, 18.2%). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed high resistance rates against macrolides, tetracycline, quinolones, &#946;-lactams, and chloramphenicol, with percentages ranging from 35.5% to 100%. All isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) and five resistance patterns were observed. These results emphasized the risk to consumer health and the need to establish a surveillance strategy to control and prevent the emergence and the spread of resistant strains of Campylobacter in poultry and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We investigated the inhibitory effects of AgNPs on biofilm formation ability of the isolates and the genetic relatedness of the isolates from various sources determined using RAPD-PCR. Fifty isolates were identified using PCR, and all the isolates were of type A. The cpe and cpb2 genes were detected in 12% and 56% of the isolates, respectively. The effect of AgNPs on biofilm production of six representative isolates indicated that at the highest concentration of AgNPs (100 &#181;g/mL), the inhibition percentages were 80.8-82.8%. The RAPD-PCR patterns of the 50 C. perfringens isolates from various sources revealed 33 profiles and four clusters, and the discriminatory power of RAPD-PCR was high. Multidrug-resistant C. perfringens isolates are predominant in the study area. The inhibition of biofilm formation by C. perfringens isolates was dose-dependent, and RAPD-PCR is a promising method for studying the genetic relatedness between the isolates from various sources. This is the first report of AgNPs' anti-biofilm activity against C. perfringens from chickens, pigeons, camels, and humans, to the best of our knowledge.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Criteria to establish the diagnosis of these conditions have not changed over the years; thus, the triad composed by clinical signs, lesions and viral detection in lesions are still the hallmark for PCV-2-SD and PCV-2-RD. In contrast, PCV-2-SI diagnosis is not usually performed since this condition is perceived to be controlled by default through vaccination. PDNS is diagnosed by gross and histopathological findings, and PCV-2 detection is not recognized as a diagnostic criterion. Molecular biology methods as a proxy for PCVD diagnoses have been extensively used in the last decade, although these techniques should be mainly considered as monitoring tools rather than diagnostic ones. What has changed over the years is the epidemiological picture of PCV-2 through the massive use of vaccination, which allowed the decrease in infectious pressure paralleled with a decrease in overall herd immunity. Consequently, the need for establishing the diagnosis of PCVD has increased lately, especially in cases with a PCV-2-SD-like condition despite vaccination. Therefore, the objective of the present review is to update the current knowledge on diagnostic criteria for PCVDs and to contextualize the interest of using molecular biology methods in the overall picture of these diseases within variable epidemiological scenarios of PCV-2 infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They are more accurate in determining bull fertility than conventional semen quality tests. Protamine-1 (PRM1) is a gene or protein crucial for packaging and protecting sperm DNA until fertilization affects normal sperm function. This study analyzes the genes and proteins potential from PRM1 as fertility markers for different breeds of bulls utilized in the artificial insemination programs, expected to be an accurate tool in interpreting bull fertility in Indonesia. This study used Limousin, Holstein, and Ongole Grade bulls divided into two groups based on fertility, high-fertility (HF) and low fertility (LF). The semen quality assessment included progressive motility (computer-assisted semen analysis), viability (eosin-nigrosine), and plasma membrane integrity (HOS test). Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) was assessed using the acridine orange staining and the Halomax test. Sperm PRM deficiency was evaluated with the chromomycin A3 method. Moreover, PRM1 gene expression was measured using qRT-PCR, and the PRM1 protein abundance was measured with the enzyme immunoassay method. Semen quality values, relative expression of PRM1 gene, and quantity of PRM1 protein were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in HF bulls than in LF bulls. The SDF and PRM deficiency values in LF bulls were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than HF bulls. Additionally, PRM1 at the gene and protein levels correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.01) with fertility. Therefore, PRM1 is a potential candidate for fertility markers in bulls in Indonesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Orexin has been proven to be involved in both central and peripheral control of neuroendocrine functions, energy balance, and metabolism. Since its discovery, its ability to increase appetite as well as regulate feeding behavior has been widely explored in mammalian food production animals such as cattle, pigs, and sheep. It is also linked to neurological disorders, leading to its intensive investigation in humans regarding narcolepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. However, in non-mammalian species, research is limited. In the case of avian species, orexin has been shown to have no central effect on feed-intake, however it was found to be involved in muscle energy metabolism and hepatic lipogenesis. This review provides current knowledge and summarizes orexin's physiological roles in livestock and pinpoints the present lacuna to facilitate further investigations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we first use an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) to determine whether NF-&#954;Bp-luciferase expression could be detected in the brain of pseudorabies virus (PRV)-infected NF-&#954;Bp-luciferase mice and to evaluate proinflammatory mediators in a well-described mouse model of PRV encephalitis. In in vitro studies, we used murine microglia (BV-2) cells to demonstrate the PRV-induced encephalitis model entailing the activation of microglia cells. The results indicate that PRV-induced neuroinflammation responses through the induction of IL-6, TNF-&#945;, COX-2, and iNOS expression occurred via the regulation of NF-&#954;B expression in BV-2 cells. In in vivo studies, compared with MOCK controls, the mice infected with neurovirulent PRV exhibited significantly elevated NF-&#954;B transcription factor activity and luciferase protein expression only in the brain by IVIS. Mild focal necrosis was also observed in the brain. Further examination revealed biomarkers of inflammation, including inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; and interleukin (IL)-6, both of which constituted proinflammatory cytokines. PRV infection stimulated inflammation and COX-2 and iNOS expression of IL-6 and TNF-&#945;. The presented results herein suggest that PRV induces iNOS and COX-2 expression in the brain of NF-&#954;Bp-luciferase mice via NF-&#954;B activation. In conclusion, we used NF-&#954;Bp-luciferase mice to establish a specific virus-induced encephalitis model via PRV intranasal infection. In the future, this in vivo model will provide potential targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies focusing on NF-&#954;B inflammatory biomarkers and the development of drugs for viral inflammatory diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, in feline CKD, renal expression of TGF-&#946;1 and how it changes as the disease progresses have not been fully studied. In the present study, we immunohistochemically assessed the renal expression levels of TGF-&#946;1 in cats with CKD and statistically analyzed its correlation with CKD severity. Clear immunosignals were detected in the glomerular mesangial cells, Bowman's capsules, proximal tubules, distal nephrons, platelets, and vascular smooth muscles in the kidneys of cats with CKD. Statistically, luminal signals in the distal nephrons showed positive correlations with plasma creatinine levels and glomerulosclerosis, while those in the proximal tubules and platelets showed negative correlations with plasma urea and/or creatinine levels. Therefore, it was suggested that the changes in the renal expression of TGF-&#946;1 could be associated with progression of feline CKD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Antibody levels were higher for LSA when compared to rKMP11 (p = 0.001). Ibizan hounds were all seronegative to rKMP11 and 18% were low seropositive to LSA. Sick dogs presented higher antibody response to both antigens compared to the rest of the groups (p &lt; 0.0001). All groups showed higher IFN-&#947; levels after LSA compared to rKMP11 responses (p &lt; 0.05). The highest response to LSA was found in Ibizan hounds (p &lt; 0.05). IFN-&#947; to LSA and rKMP11 stimulation was observed in 34% and in 2.8% of the sick dogs, respectively. Here, we demonstrated that anti-rKMP11 antibodies are mainly present in dogs with moderate to severe disease. Furthermore, cellular immune response measured by specific ex vivo IFN-&#947; production was more intense to LSA than stimulated to rKMP11.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The tightly folded nature of the ewe cervix, the inconsistent ovarian response to various superovulatory treatments, and the requirement of labor to handle animals, particularly during large-scale production, has limited the implementation of successful MOET in sheep. Moreover, several extrinsic factors (e.g., sources, the purity of gonadotrophins and their administration) and intrinsic factors (e.g., breed, age, nutrition, reproductive status) severely limit the practicability of MOET in sheep and other domestic animals. In this review, we summarize the effects of different superovulatory protocols, and their respective ovarian responses, in terms of ovulation rate, and embryo recovery and transfer. Furthermore, various strategies, such as inhibin immunization, conventional superovulation protocols, and melatonin implants for improving the ovarian response, are discussed in detail. Other reproductive techniques and their relative advantages and disadvantages, such as artificial insemination (AI), and donor embryo recovery and transfer to the recipient through different procedures, which must be taken into consideration for achieving satisfactory results during any MOET program in sheep, are also summarized in this article.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324846</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Inflammatory, Mechanical and Infectious Complications Associated with Peripheral Intravenous Catheters in Dogs and Cats: A Risk Factor Analysis.</Title>	<Abstract>The placement of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) is potentially associated with complications that negatively impact healthcare. Our study investigated factors associated with the occurrence of PIVC-related complications in dogs and cats at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The second aim was to determine the prevalence of PIVC bacterial colonization. A total of 76 dogs and 40 cats with PIVCs were evaluated for the occurrence of phlebitis and mechanical complications. The devices were removed when they ceased to be functional or when complications occurred, and the content was submitted for bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Both multivariable linear regression models and ROC analysis were employed. Complications were recorded in 46.6% of cases, and 20.7% of catheters yielded a positive culture. Among the isolates, 45% were classified as multi-resistant. In dogs, a &#8805;36-h indwelling time was associated with an increased risk of complications. Male cats seem more prone to developing complications, while the insertion of PIVCs under sedation may represent a protective factor in this species. In conclusion, PIVC-associated complications were frequently observed, and the high rate of positive culture for PIVCs, together with the presence of multi-resistant isolates, is a cause of concern in a hospital setting.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Day-old broiler chicks (n = 320/experiment) were randomly assigned to 32 pens (n = 10 broilers/pen) and allocated to one of four dietary groups: (1) unchallenged group (NEG); (2) C. perfringens-challenged group (POS); (3) POS group fed a diet supplemented with powdered BPs; and (4) POS group fed a diet supplemented with encapsulated BPs. On days 21, 22, and 23 post-hatch, all chickens except NEG were orally inoculated twice a day with 2 mL C. perfringens (1.0 &#215; 10[8] cfu/mL). Varying BP levels were detected in gut digesta at all ages and were numerically or significantly higher in the encapsulated BP group than in the powdered BP group. Dietary powder or encapsulated BPs reversed the C. perfringens-mediated increase in crypt depth. In addition, villus height to crypt depth ratio was elevated in the NEG and BP-treated/challenged groups compared with that in the POS group. C. perfringens counts in the cecum were significantly lower in the BP-fed chickens than in the POS group. The encapsulated BP-supplemented diet-fed chickens had the highest serum IgA levels. Collectively, our results suggest that dietary BP remains viable in intestinal digesta upon ingestion and can inhibit cecal C. perfringens counts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eighteen frames were applied to eighteen bone specimens. The fracture area (FA), the radiolucent area (RLA) and the radiopaque area (ROA) inside the FA were calculated for each construct on both postoperative views. The ratio between the RLA and FA and between the ROA and FA was used to evaluate the amount of bone visible in the FA with a radiolucent and a radiopaque fixator, respectively. Finally, the areas of RLA and ROA were compared using the Wilcoxon test and Friedman test to evaluate the effect of the radiolucent material on the amount of bone visible. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.5. In every specimen p was &lt;0.5. The amount of bone visible was significantly higher with the radiolucent frame compared to the radiopaque frame. Based on the results of this study, the use of radiolucent materials can be a valuable option for external fixation, in order to decrease the radiographic interference of the frame, allowing better assessment of fracture reduction and bone healing on postoperative radiographs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CeMV is responsible for causing worldwide epizootic events with the highest mass die-offs in cetaceans, although the epidemic status of the Canarian Archipelago seems to be that of an endemic situation. A total of 319 tissue samples from 55 BWs (35 Cuvier's BWs and 20 specimens belonging to the Mesoplodon genus) were subjected to the amplification of a fragment of the fusion protein (F) and/or phosphoprotein (P) genes of CeMV by means of one or more of three polymerase chain reactions (PCR). RNA integrity could not be demonstrated in samples from 11 animals. Positivity (dolphin morbillivirus strain (DMV)) was detected in the skin sample of only a subadult male Cuvier's BW stranded in 2002, being the earliest confirmed occurrence of DMV in the Cuvier's BW species. The obtained P gene sequence showed the closest relationship with other DMVs detected in a striped dolphin stranded in the Canary Islands in the same year. A phylogenetic analysis supports a previous hypothesis of a cross-species infection and the existence of the circulation of endemic DMV strains in the Atlantic Ocean similar to those later detected in the North-East Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the South-West Pacific.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

C. jejuni is commonly found in poultry. It is the most frequent cause of contamination and thus resulting in not only public health concerns but also economic impacts. To test for this bacterial contamination in food processing plants, this study attempted to employ a simple and rapid detection assay called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The best cutoff value for the positive determination of C. jejuni calculated using real-time LAMP quantification cycle (Cq) was derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve modeling. The model showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.936 (95% Wald CI: 0.903-0.970). Based on Youden's J statistic, the optimal cutoff value which had the highest sensitivity and specificity from the model was calculated as 18.07. The LAMP assay had 96.9% sensitivity, 95.8% specificity, and 93.9 and 97.9% positive and negative predictive values, respectively, compared to a standard culture approach for C. jejuni identification. Among all non-C. jejuni strains, the LAMP assay gave each of 12.5% false-positive results to C. coli and E. coli (1 out of 8 samples). The assay can detect C. jejuni at the lowest concentration of 10[3] CFU/mL. Our results suggest a preliminary indicator for the application of end-point LAMP assays, such as turbidity and UV fluorescence tests, to detect C. jejuni in field operations. The LAMP assay is an alternative screening test for C. jejuni contamination in food samples. The method provides a rapid detection, which requires only 9 min with a cutoff value of Cq. We performed the extraction of DNA from pure cultures and the detection of C. jejuni using the LAMP assay within 3 h. However, we were not able to reduce the time for the process of enrichment involved in our study. Therefore, we suggest that alternative enrichment media and rapid DNA extraction methods should be considered for further study. Compared to other traditional methods, our proposed assay requires less equipment and time, which is applicable at any processing steps in the food production chain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This disease is a progressive and unfortunately incurable condition. A case of polycystic kidney with chronic renal failure in house musk shrew (Suncus murinus) is described. At clinical presentation, a 16-month-old Suncus murinus showed weight loss and coarse fur. Regarding the biochemical profile, total protein concentrations increased, resulting in a declined albumin: globulin ratio. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations were markedly elevated, indicating the end stage of chronic renal failure. Serum amyloid A levels increased and revealed inflammatory reaction during the cyst formation. Histopathologically, multiple cysts were lined by a single layer of epithelial cells or low cuboidal epithelium. The contents were homogenous eosinophilic materials (mucopolysaccharides or mucoproteins) and these cysts contained abundant macrophages. There were also regeneration and dilatation of renal tubes and interstitial fibrosis. The atrophic glomeruli and glomerular capsules were thickened and hyalinized by dense amorphous mucopolysaccharides. These histopathological findings suggested that the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease shared a common mechanistic feature across species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324852</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Green Veterinary Pharmacology for Honey Bee Welfare and Health: Origanum heracleoticum L. (Lamiaceae) Essential Oil for the Control of the Apis mellifera Varroatosis.</Title>	<Abstract>Varroatosis, caused by the Varroa destructor mite, is currently the most dangerous parasitic disease threatening the survival of honey bees worldwide. Its adverse effect on the welfare and health of honey bees requires the regular use of specific acaricides. This condition has led to a growing development of resistance phenomena towards the most frequently used drugs. In addition, another important aspect that should not be understated, is the toxicity and persistence of chemicals in the environment. Therefore, the identification of viable and environmentally friendly alternatives is urgently needed. In this scenario, essential oils are promising candidates. The aim of this study was to assess the contact toxicity, the fumigation efficacy and the repellent effect of Origanum heracleoticum L. essential oil (EO) against V. destructor mite. In the contact tests, each experimental replicate consisted of 15 viable adult female mites divided as follows: 5 treated with EO diluted in HPLC grade acetone, 5 treated with acetone alone (as negative control) and 5 treated with Amitraz diluted in acetone (as positive control). The EO was tested at concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/mL. For each experimental replicate, mortality was manually assessed after one hour. The efficacy of EO fumigation was evaluated through prolonged exposure at different time intervals. After each exposure, the 5 mites constituting an experimental replicate were transferred to a Petri dish containing a honey bee larva and mortality was assessed after 48 h. The repellent action was investigated by implementing a directional choice test in a mandatory route. During the repellency tests the behavior of the mite (90 min after its introduction in the mandatory route) was not influenced by the EO. In contact tests, EO showed the best efficacy at 2 and 1 mg/mL concentrations, neutralizing (dead + inactivated) 90.9% and 80% of the mites, respectively. In fumigation tests, the mean mortality rate of V. destructor at maximum exposure time (90 min) was 60% and 84% at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Overall, these results demonstrate a significant efficacy of O. heracleoticum EO against V. destructor, suggesting a possible alternative use in the control of varroatosis in honey bee farms in order to improve Apis mellifera welfare and health and, consequently, the hive productions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324853</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Historical Evolution of Cattle Management and Herd Health of Dairy Farms in OECD Countries.</Title>	<Abstract>This work aimed to review the important aspects of the dairy industry evolution at herd level, interrelating production with health management systems. Since the beginning of the industrialization of the dairy cattle sector (1950s), driven by the need to feed the rapidly growing urban areas, this industry has experienced several improvements, evolving in management and technology. These changes have been felt above all in the terms of milking, rearing, nutrition, reproductive management, and design of facilities. Shortage of labor, emphasis on increasing farm efficiency, and quality of life of the farmers were the driving factors for these changes. To achieve it, in many areas of the world, pasture production has been abandoned, moving to indoor production, which allows for greater nutritional and reproductive control of the animals. To keep pace with this paradigm in milk production, animal health management has also been improved. Prevention and biosecurity have become essential to control and prevent pathologies that cause great economic losses. As such, veterinary herd health management programs were created, allowing the management of health of the herd as a whole, through the common work of veterinarians and farmers. These programs address the farms holistically, from breeding to nutrition, from prevention to consultancy. In addition, farmers are now faced with a consumer more concerned on animal production, valuing certified products that respect animal health and welfare, as well as environmental sustainability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324854</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Risk Analysis of 24 Residual Antibiotics in Poultry Eggs in Shandong, China (2018-2020).</Title>	<Abstract>Although antibiotics have played a certain positive role in the prevention and treatment of poultry diseases, as well as the promotion of poultry growth, some farmers use antibiotics in an incorrect way in the breeding process, resulting in antibiotic residues in poultry tissues, organs and edible products. Residual antibiotics enter the human body through the food chain and accumulate, which not only causes poisoning and allergic reactions, but also drug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms, thus endangering the health of consumers. In this investigation, the residues of 24 antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, macrolides, tetracyclines, antivirals, lincomycin and florfenicol, were analyzed in 1211 poultry egg samples in Shandong, China, from 2018 to 2020. Then, based on the per capita intake of poultry eggs recommended in the dietary guidelines of Chinese residents, the maximum residue limit of veterinary drugs specified in Chinese regulations and the average weight of males and females aged 18 and over in 2020, the risk of residual antibiotics was evaluated by International Food Safety indices (IFS). The detection results showed that 104 of 1211 samples were detected with antibiotic residues, with a detection rate of 8.58%. Among them, the main residues were enrofloxacin, sulfonamides and florfenicol. The IFS calculation results showed that the IFS of residual antibiotics ranged from 1.44 &#215; 10[-7] to 0.102. Therefore, although enrofloxacin, sarafloxacin, danofloxacin, sulfonamides, tilmicosin, doxycycline, florfenicol, which are banned during egg laying, were detected in poultry eggs in Shandong, these residues did not pose a threat to the health of Chinese adult consumers, according to the daily dietary habits of Chinese people. However, it is strongly suggested that Shandong should strengthen the monitoring of antibiotic use during egg laying.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the Border Collie, sensory neuropathy is different from what is observed in acral mutilation syndrome, as the genetic mutation is linked to an inversion disrupting the FAM134B gene. Diagnosis was based on history, clinical signs and genetic testing. The prognosis of sensory neuropathies is poor and no curative treatment is available. In the present case, oclacitinib was started for symptomatic treatment of the self-mutilation. A good control of the self-mutilation was quickly observed with an improvement in quality of life for five months. Unfortunately, progression of neurological signs with severe proprioceptive deficits, ataxia, muscular atrophy and urinary/fecal incontinence was observed. Five months after diagnosis, the owner elected for euthanasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cow was regularly vaccinated against the main respiratory pathogens and was given a calcium salt solution per os shortly after calving in order to prevent milk fever. Despite therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, the cow spontaneously died one week later and was necropsied. On gross examination, a severe, acute, diffuse fibrinonecrotic tracheitis was observed. In addition, the cranioventral portions of both lungs appeared firm and severely congested, while the pleural surface was covered by a discrete amount of fibrinous exudate. Microscopically, the following lesions were observed: tracheal hemorrhages, acute, fibrinonecrotic and suppurative tracheitis, pulmonary hemorrhages, fibrinous bronchopneumonia and fibrinous pleuritis. Noteworthy, multiple foci of mineralization were observed, scattered throughout the lung parenchyma and occasionally within the tracheal mucosa. The presence of calcium deposits was confirmed by means of Von Kossa staining method. Based on clinical history, clinical signs and pathological findings, aspiration pneumonia caused by the accidental inhalation of liquid calcium salt supplement was diagnosed. The present case report highlights the relevance of the staff training to optimize animal production and welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The development of anthelmintic resistance to conventionally used drugs suggests the path towards the use of natural remedies as a possible alternative. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic efficacy of the hydroalcoholic extracts of basal leaves (It-BL), cauline leaves (It-CL) and flowers (It-F) of Isatis tinctoria (Brassicaceae), a spontaneous Sicilian species renowned as an important source of bioactive compounds. The dry extracts of the different parts of the plant were tested using the egg hatch test (EHT) in vitro to verify the efficacy against ovine GIN at different concentrations (1.00, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 mg/mL). Thiabendazole and deionized water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The results obtained from EHT indicated that all the I. tinctoria extracts were highly effective (p &lt; 0.0001) in inhibiting egg hatching within 48 h of exposure. The in vitro inhibitory effect was never less than 84% in all doses tested, and it was only slightly lower than the standard drug thiabendazole (95.6%). The current study documents the anthelmintic activity of I. tinctoria against sheep&#8217;s GIN, suggesting its application as alternative natural method to limit the use of antiparasitic drugs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among the latter, one of the most important reasons is infection by the microsporidia Nosema ceranae, which is the etiological agent of type C nosemosis. This species was first described in Asian honeybees (Apis cerana). Nowadays, domestic honeybees (Apis mellifera) worldwide are also becoming infected due to globalization. Type C nosemosis can be asymptomatic or can cause important damage to bees, such as changes in temporal polyethism, energy and oxidative stress, immunity loss, and decreased average life expectancy. It causes drastic reductions in workers, numbers of broods, and honey production, finally leading to colony loss. Common treatment is based on fumagillin, an antibiotic with side effects and relatively poor efficiency, which is banned in the European Union. Natural products, probiotics, food supplements, nutraceuticals, and other veterinary drugs are currently under study and might represent alternative treatments. Prophylaxis and management of affected colonies are essential to control the disease. While N. ceranae is one potential cause of bee losses in a colony, other factors must also be considered, especially synergies between microsporidia and the use of insecticides.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the effect of replacing soybean meal with Tenebrio molitor larval meal on the performance of slow-growing chickens was assessed. A total of 128 one-day-old chickens (Colorield) were randomly divided into a control group (C) (n = 64), fed with soybean meal, and an experimental group (TM) (n = 64), fed with T. molitor larvae meal. The chicks were slaughtered after 95 days. Three different isoenergetic and isoproteic diets (F1, F2 and F3) were used for each group. The F1 diet resulted in higher body weight gain and higher feed and water intakes in group C, but a lower feed conversion ratio. Contrarily, diets F2 and F3 did not produce differences in the studied parameters between the two groups, except for body weight gain in the case of diet F2, which was highest in group C. Therefore, weight gain and feed and water intakes were significantly higher in group C, but there were no differences in feed conversion ratio or live weight. In conclusion, the total replacement of soybean meal with T. molitor larvae meal resulted in a reduction in feed intake and a consequent reduction in weight. During this period, partial rather than total substitution may be recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We conducted active surveillance of IAV among 672 cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) living in 27 free-ranging colonies in Thailand between March and November 2019. A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was employed as the screening test against 16 subtypes of avian influenza virus (AIV) and two strains of the H1 subtype of human influenza virus. The serum samples with HI titers &#8805;20 were further confirmed by microneutralization (MN) assay. Real-time RT-PCR assay was performed to detect the conserved region of the influenza matrix (M) gene. The seropositive rate for subtypes of IAV, including AIV H1 (1.6%, 11/672), AIV H2 (15.2%, 102/672), AIV H3 (0.3%, 2/672), AIV H9 (3.4%, 23/672), and human H1 (NP-045) (0.9%, 6/672), was demonstrated. We also found antibody against more than one subtype of IAV in 15 out of 128 positive tested sera (11.7%). Moreover, influenza genome could be detected in 1 out of 245 pool swab samples (0.41%). Evidence of IAV infection presented here emphasizes the role of NHPs in the ecology of the virus. Our findings highlight the need to further conduct a continuous active surveillance program in NHP populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After clinical examination, blood was sampled from 11 cows with PFP, 30 with GP and 14 healthy cows. Serum and plasma refractometry and glutaraldehyde tests were used to evaluate the inflammation level, while hydro-electrolytes and acid-base parameters were assessed using an EPOC&#174; device. In addition to clinical signs of dehydration (&gt;10%), blood analysis showed a high fibrinogen concentration (PFP: 8.64 &#177; 8.82 g/L; GP: 7.83 &#177; 2.45 g/L) and fast glutaraldehyde coagulation (&lt;3 min) indicative of severe inflammation in both diseases compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a severe decrease in electrolytes concentration (Na+: 126.93 &#177; 5.79 mmol/L; K+: 3.7 &#177; 1.3 mmol/L; Ca++: 0.89 &#177; 0.12 mmol/L; Cl&#8722;: 82.38 &#177; 6.45 mmol/L) and a significant increase in bicarbonate (30.87 &#177; 8.16 mmol/L), base excess (5.71 &#177; 7.42 mmol/l), L-lactate (8.1 &#177; 4.85 mmol/L) and creatinine (3.53 &#177; 2.30 mg/dL) were observed in cows with GP compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, few major perturbations were noticed in PFP, where only K+ (3.64 &#177; 0.25 mmol/L) and Ca++ (1.06 &#177; 0.09 mmol/L) were significantly modified (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, a high dehydration and severe inflammation are induced by PFP and GP. Nevertheless, GP causes more electrolytes and acid-base disturbances than PFP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, using affected and unaffected poultry farms' locations during an HPAI H5N6 epidemic in South Korea, we identified places where clusters of HPAI cases were found. Hotspots were defined as regions having clusters of HPAI cases. With the help of the statistical computer program R, a kernel density estimate and a spatial scan statistic were employed for this purpose. A kernel density estimate and detection of significant clusters through a spatial scan statistic both showed that districts in the Chungcheongbuk-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Jeollanam-do provinces are more vulnerable to HPAI outbreaks. Prior to the migration season, high-risk districts should implement particular biosecurity measures. High biosecurity measures, as well as improving the cleanliness of the poultry environment, would undoubtedly aid in the prevention of HPAIV transmission to poultry farms in these high-risk regions of South Korea.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Multifocal severe bronchiectasis and neutrophilic bronchitis was found with thoracic computed tomography and cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, respectively. While oral azithromycin was administered, clinical signs were absent. However, stopping azithromycin lead repeatedly to presumed bacterial pneumonia within 1-2 months. With sub-antimicrobial dosed oral doxycycline (initially 1.5 mg/kg once daily for 3 months, then 0.7-0.5 mg/kg once daily for 6 months), the dog remained free from clinical signs. Bronchiectasis is characterized by marked irreversible bronchial dilation. Accumulation of intraluminal mucopurulent material and neutrophilic inflammation cause chronic cough and recurrent bacterial pneumonia. For therapy, life-long oral antibiotics are recommended. Chronic antibiotic administration, however, can select resistant bacterial strains. Though both azithromycin and doxycycline possess anti-inflammatory effects, doxycycline has these off-target properties at a sub-antimicrobial dose. In this report, a chronic sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline resulted in the resolution of chronic cough, exercise intolerance and labored breathing, and prevented recurrence of suspected bacterial pneumonia in the long-term in a dog with severe bronchiectasis. Beneficial effect of doxycycline is probably related to its anti-inflammatory effects rather than its antimicrobial properties.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this case report, we present a long-term electrodiagnostic follow-up of a 5-day-old female Holstein calf with brachial plexus syndrome. Electrodiagnostic studies were carried out at 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 7 months and 12 months after admission. Initially, EMG confirmed the damage to the brachial plexus, potentially indicating a condition of neurotmesis or axonotmesis. However, motor NCS and the repeated electrodiagnostic follow-up, along with the evolution of the clinical signs, allowed a more favorable diagnosis of axonotmesis to be made. In fact, EMG showed a slow but gradual reduction and finally the disappearance of spontaneous pathological activity, while motor NCS revealed an increase in the amplitude and areas of the compound muscle action potentials. The animal was deemed fully recovered 12 months after admission. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the use of motor NCS in bovine medicine and it demonstrates that electrodiagnostics represent a useful and practical tool for the evaluation and prognosis of brachial plexus injury cases in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324866</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison of a Chromogenic Urine Culture Plate System (UTid+) and Conventional Urine Culture for Canine and Feline Specimens.</Title>	<Abstract>In companion animal medicine, urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy. Definitive diagnosis of UTI requires isolation of bacteria with routine urine culture from an animal with concurrent clinical signs. Urine culture is typically performed at reference laboratories where paired susceptibility testing can be performed, but delays in shipment or processing can affect results. This study evaluated the use of a selective chromogenic, point-of-care culture system (UTid+) compared to conventional urine culture. A total of 119 (73 canine and 46 feline) cystocentesis urine samples were evaluated. Conventional urine culture was positive for 28 (23.5%) of the 119 cultures and UTid+ culture was positive for 26 (21.8%). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 92.3%, 97.8%, 92.3%, 97.8 and 96.6% for UTid+ respectively. Overall, the UTid+ culture system showed an acceptable level of accuracy when compared to conventional urine culture. Agreement of identification results was high (&#954; = 0.90) with an important exception being Proteus spp. which was only identified in 1/3 positive cultures. UTid+ may be useful in scenarios where a common UTI pathogen is expected and identification within 24 h is ideal; however, conventional urine culture remains the gold standard.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the future, HPAI has the potential to be a source of zoonoses and pandemic disease drivers. It is necessary to identify areas of high risk that are more vulnerable to HPAI infections. In this study, we applied unbiased predictions based on known information to find points of localities with a high probability of point prevalence rate. To carry out such predictions, we utilized the inverse distance weighting (IDW) and kriging method, with the help of the R statistical computing program. The provinces of Jeollanam-do, Gyeonggi-do, Chungcheongbuk-do and Ulsan have high anticipated risk. This research might aid in the management of avian influenza threats associated with various potential risks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This case report describes weight gain, clinicopathological and radiographic changes after early diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism in three British shorthair cats&#8217; siblings. Data were assessed at 53 (diagnosis), 83, 185 and 365 days of age. Correlations between serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and body weight, levothyroxine dose, total thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were evaluated. The body weights of the congenital hypothyroid kittens were compared with those of their two healthy siblings and British shorthair kittens of the same age. At diagnosis, the congenital hypothyroid kittens showed a significantly lower body weight compared to the healthy siblings (p = 0.03). After diagnosis, oral levothyroxine supplementation was started. The difference in body weight was no longer observed after one month of treatment. The clinical signs, clinicopathological and radiographic abnormalities ameliorated after one month of treatment. IGF-1 concentration was significantly positively correlated with body weight (rs = 0.80, p &lt; 0.002). In conclusion, resolution of the clinical signs, achieving a consistent within-breed weight, and improvement of the clinicopathological and radiographic parameters demonstrated the importance of the early diagnosis and treatment of feline congenital hypothyroidism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, bioequivalence, and cardiovascular effects of a custom-made oral pimobendan solution (PS) formulation compared to a reference solution (RS) formulation in conscious, healthy dogs. A randomized crossover design was performed on dogs that received RS and PS formulations at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 h after oral administration for PK analysis; bioequivalence was also calculated. Echocardiography was also performed to assess the cardiovascular effects. The results revealed that the plasma concentrations of pimobendan and o-desmethyl-pimobendan (active metabolite) in the case of both formulations were comparable. The relative ratios of geometric mean concentrations for all significant parameters of PK were within a range of 80-125%, indicating bioequivalence. In addition, both formulations increased cardiac contraction significantly when compared with the baseline, and no differences in cardiac contractility were detected between the formulations. The PS formulation can be used as alternative to the RS formulation for the management of congestive heart disease because of the bioequivalence between the two formulations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several feed additives are currently being used to improve the nutritive value of feed as well as replacing the subtherapeutic levels of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). This study was designed to investigate the effect of a feed additive that is a blend of multi-strain Bacillus spp. probiotics and a xylanase in a 2 &#215; 2 factorial dietary treatments design, testing two levels of the feed additive blend (0 and 100 g/MT) and two cereal grain types (corn and wheat) on live performance, gut lesions, environmental Clostridium perfringens load, and pathogen load in the digesta of broiler chickens (E. tenella, total aerobic count cells (APC), E. coli, and C. perfringens). Day-old chicks were randomly placed in 10 replicate pens per treatment with 52 birds per replicate and grown to 42 d of age. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. At 42 d, birds fed EnzaPro were heavier (p &lt; 0.0004) than unsupplemented birds. An improvement in FCR (p = 0.03) was observed from 1 to 42 d by approximately two points in both corn- and wheat-based diets supplemented with EnzaPro. In wheat-based diets, supplementing EnzaPro reduced (p &lt; 0.0001) a 21 d lesion score of intestines with a further reduction (p &lt; 0.02) at 42 d. EnzaPro reduced (p &lt; 0.03) litter moisture by approximately 1% compared to non-supplemented EnzaPro in both corn- and wheat-based diets. Pathogen load in digesta (C. perfringens, E. tenella, APC, and E. coli) was reduced (p &lt; 0.0002) when EnzaPro was supplemented in diets. It can be concluded that EnzaPro (a blend of DFM Bacillus spp (1 &#215; 105 CFU/g feed) and xylanase (10 XU/g feed)) may be used in both corn- and wheat-based diets to improve the performance and gut health of broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324871</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Environmental Contamination by Echinococcus spp. Eggs as a Risk for Human Health in Educational Farms of Sardinia, Italy.</Title>	<Abstract>Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a severe zoonosis caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. These parasites are naturally transmitted between canid definitive hosts that harbour the adult stage in the intestine, and mainly ungulate intermediate hosts, with larval cysts developing in their internal organs. The close coexistence between dog and sheep with incorrect hygiene management are the most important factors for the persistence of this parasitic pathology. The Educational Farms (EF) are farms and agritourisms suitably equipped to carry out training activities for people interested in farm practices and agricultural processing, in particular student groups. Public attendance of farms represents a new potential risk factor for the zoonoses transmission. Consumption of contaminated food and water in combination with contact or playing with domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are possible routes of zoonoses human infection. In fact, Echinococcus spp. eggs may persist in the environment up to several months at low temperatures and moist conditions, having the chance of contaminating different matrices and surfaces. The aim of this investigation was to study environmental contamination by parasitic elements as a risk for zoonoses, such as Echinococcus spp. A total of 116 samples (35 of water, 33 of soil, 23 of vegetables, 25 of dog faeces) were collected in 30 EF in Sardinia. Samples were subjected to biomolecular investigation for the research of specific gene sequences of Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis and Taenia spp. The study allowed to identify eight positive EF due to the presence of Echinococcusgranulosus in eight dog faeces samples and one positive EF due to the presence of Taenia spp. in a water sample. The work has allowed to develop and harmonise the diagnostic methods and operating protocols essential for controlling the spread of the CE to create "One Health" intervention plans in high endemic areas through the implementation of SOP (standard operating procedures) for monitoring the pathology in animals, humans and environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present research was to identify macroscopic changes in the mandible, based on three-dimensional Cone Beam Computed Tomography analysis. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were divided into two equal groups, experimental (group A) and control (group B). Each consisted of three equal subgroups of 12 rats (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3). Full-cast orthodontic intraoral devices were attached to the maxillary incisors of the experimental animals, and effected functional posterior mandibular displacement. Throughout the experimental period, all animals were fed with mashed food. Animals were sacrificed at 30 days (A1, B1), 60 days (A2, B2) and 90 days (A3, B3). At the 60th day of the experiment, the orthodontic devices were removed from the remaining experimental subgroup A3. Measurements revealed significant differences in the anteroposterior dimensions between experimental and control subgroups. However, the observed changes in the vertical dimensions, Condylion/Go'-Menton and the Intercondylar distance proved insignificant. Posterior mandibular displacement of the mandible in growing rats affects the morphology of the mandible and culminates in the development of a smaller mandible at a grown age.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The relationship with dogs helps humans to cope with stress during an emotionally challenging period, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, a growing global interest in pets has been registered, including the volunteering for shelter/stray dog protection. However, a considerable increase of human dysfunctional interventions toward dogs has been observed in Southern Italy. In this study, we investigated the psychological characteristics of humans volunteering at animal shelter or engaged in stray dog protection. The effect of psychological training and education about dog ethological needs on volunteers' helping behavior was also analyzed. We report that the intervention can improve volunteers' physiological features and, consequently, may enhance human management and dog welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Analysis of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolated from pigs on Jeju Island between 2009 and 2019 identified five BVDV-1a strains and one BVDV-1b strain. These BVDV types were shown to be the same types as BVDV strains isolated from neighboring cow farms. BVDV antibody-positive pigs (both BVDV-1 and -2) were also detected at 54 of 168 pig farms during this period. In pig infection experiments using BVDV-1a and -2a strains isolated from neighboring cow farms, BVDV-1a was detected in the blood of one of four pigs infected at both 6 and 35 days post-infection (dpi) and in the blood of two of the four pigs at 28 dpi. Pigs showed higher anti-BVDV-1 titers (5.5 &#177; 1.5 log2) at 35 dpi. BVDV-2a was detected in the blood of one of four pigs infected with this virus at 28 dpi only, and lower antibody titers (2.75 &#177; 0.75 log2) were seen in these pigs at 35 dpi. While BVDV infection is not particularly pathogenic in pigs, it is still important to monitor porcine BVDV infections due to a differential diagnosis of CSFV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35324875</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Detection of Malpighamoeba mellificae in Honey Bees.</Title>	<Abstract>Malpighamoeba mellificae is a protozoan that infects the Malpighian tubules of honey bees. The amoebae, ingested as cysts, develop into trophozoites that feed upon tubule epithelia. The resulting damage of the Malpighian tubules can induce an imbalance of waste excretion and hemolymph exchange. This causes the so-called amoebiasis disease in adult bees, which may co-occur with Nosema infections. Most reports of this amoeba are from the 1960s and earlier, and knowledge of the disease and its spreading is very poor. The lack of any genetic marker for the species hampers its sensitive identification using molecular tools and gaining knowledge on its epidemiology. Here, we present a diagnostic RT-qPCR assay, consisting of two primers and one probe that were developed based on 18S rRNA sequences of the amoeba, generated with metagenomic sequencing of Malpighian tubules with and without M. mellificae cysts. The assay was initially tested and adjusted with samples microscopically tested for the presence of M. mellificae cysts. Later, it was validated and material with unknown infection status was tested. The sensitive diagnostic Malpighamoeba disease 18S assay is now ready to be applied for honey bee health monitoring purposes and to investigate the prevalence of M. mellificae in more detail.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, poultry vaccines, in ovo injections to embryos, subcutaneous injections to chickens, and intramuscular injections are administered using needle injections. This article presents a new needle-free in ovo injection device method that uses push-pull solenoids to eject liquid jets, mainly for embryonic eggs of chickens. Furthermore, our study investigated the suitable jet pressures for using this method and the post-injection hatching rates in 18-day-old embryonic eggs. Using this method, we could deliver the liquid to the allantoic and amniotic cavities or the muscle tissue through the egg membrane of the air chamber using a jet pressure of ~6-7 MPa or ~8 MPa. After injecting 0.25 mL of 0.9% saline into 18-day-old Lohmann breed layer embryonic eggs and specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonic eggs at a jet pressure of ~7 MPa, we observed hatching rates of 98.3% and 85.7%, respectively. This study's electromagnetic needle-free in ovo injection device can apply vaccine or nutrient solution injection for embryo eggs and serve as a reference for future studies on needle-free in ovo injection automation systems, jet pressure control, and injection pretreatment processes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The farm of origin was traced and confirmed positive for ASF. This recurrence was following a period of absence of outbreaks in domestic pigs after the first incursion in 2019, during which a total of 14 domestic pig farms were confirmed between September and October 2019. In 2020, a total of two farms were confirmed, and the molecular characterization of key regions of the genome showed that the two isolates from 2020 were identical with the previous isolates from South Korea in 2019. The continued spread and circulation of ASF in the wild boar population represents an increased risk of spill-over outbreaks in domestic pigs, and, therefore, additional control measures should be implemented for farms in these regions, including a heightened level of surveillance. This was the case for the index farm, which was required to send pigs only to the designated abattoir at which the suspect case was quickly detected. The improvement of biosecurity in pig farms, particularly at the wild boar-domestic pig interface, will be key to the successful control of ASF in the region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The presence of taeniid eggs was recorded in 400 dog faeces collected from the four different regions in the Sulaimani Governorate. The parasite eggs were recovered from fresh and aged faecal samples of the dogs using two isolation techniques, a flotation method (Sheather's solution, modified; specific gravity: d = 1.27) and a sedimentation method (formal-ether) in which the sediments from dog faeces were collected. Both methods were used for Copro-PCR to detect the presence of Echinococcus species egg through DNA using common primers designed to amplify a partial gene of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COX1). The results of the microscopic examination showed a higher prevalence rate, i.e., 97 (24.25%) of E. granulosus among stray dogs generally in Sulaimani Governorate. The prevalence of E. granulosus among stray dogs according to the district area was 40, 24, 23, and 20.8% in Rzgari, Kalar, Sulaimani, and Halabja, respectively. The positive samples (n = 50) were selected for molecular confirmation, the DNA was extracted from the sediment of the positive samples and 40 (80%) samples were successfully amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The sequences show that all samples belong to the Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (G1-G3), with slight genetic variation. It was concluded that the sediment of dog faeces can be used for DNA extraction, which is a new method that increases the sensitivity of the test, and the amount of DNA yield would be higher than the routine method, which directly uses faeces of the dogs. In addition, the molecular diagnosis was more sensitive than the microscope examination for the presence of E. granulosus eggs. The prevalence of E. granulosus in both the final hosts and the intermediate hosts must be regularly monitored.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Previous studies have shown that APEC strains are more often related to certain O-serogroups such asO78, O2 and O1. E. coli has been reported to act either as a primary or secondary agent in complicating other infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of and characterize the O-serogroups of E. coli strains isolated from commercial layer and layer breeder flocks showing macroscopic lesions of colibacillosis and increased or normal mortality in Greece. Furthermore, we attempted to assess the interaction between infectious agents such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), infectious bronchitis (IBV) and infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) with E. coli infections in layer flocks with increased mortality. Our study revealed that in addition to the common serogroups (O78, O2), many other, and less common serogroups were identified, including O111. The O78, O111 and O2 serogroups were frequently detected in flocks with lesions of colibacillosis and increased mortality whereas O2, O88 and O8 were reported more commonly in birds with colibacillosis lesions but normal mortality rates. These data provide important information for colibacillosis monitoring and define preventative measures, especially by using effective vaccination programs because E. coli vaccines are reported to mainly offer homologous protection. Finally, concerning the association of the four tested infectious agents with E. coli mortality, our study did not reveal a statistically significant effect of the above infectious agents tested with E. coli infection mortality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study is a retrospective review of medical records from 2015 to 2020 to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of 11 PF dogs treated with oral modified ciclosporin and GCs. Concurrent GCs were given with ciclosporin to all PF dogs. Nine dogs (9/11) achieved complete remission (CR); five dogs received ciclosporin at a mean dose of 6.2 mg/kg/day; and four dogs received a combination of ciclosporin and ketoconazole at a mean dose of 3 mg/kg/day, respectively. Two dogs (2/11) showed only 25% or poor response, with the development of new PF lesions during treatment. The mean duration of ciclosporin therapy for nine dogs to achieve CR was 65 days (median 57 days, range 24-119 days). Slow tapering of oral GCs while continuing ciclosporin at the same dose and frequency in nine dogs with CR led to recurrence of PF lesions in four dogs, whereas, in five dogs, oral glucocorticoids were discontinued without a PF flare. Oral modified ciclosporin combined with GCs achieved CR in 9 out of 11 PF dogs during the induction phase in this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Changes in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activities in the presence of the potential TMPRSS2/matriptase inhibitors (MI) were measured using fluorometric and luminescent assays. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of these inhibitors was evaluated using the MTS method. In addition, 60 min-long microsomal stability assays were performed using an UPLC-MS/MS procedure to elucidate depletion rates of the inhibitors. CYP1A2 was influenced significantly by MI-463 and MI-1900 in rat microsomes, by MI-432 and MI-482 in beagle microsomes, and by MI-432, MI-463, MI-482, and MI-1900 in cynomolgus monkey microsomes. The IC50 values in monkey microsomes were 1.30 &#177; 0.14 &#181;M, 2.4 &#177; 1.4 &#181;M, 0.21 &#177; 0.09 &#181;M, and 1.1 &#177; 0.8 &#181;M for inhibitors MI-432, MI-463, MI-482, and MI-1900, respectively. The depletion rates of the parent compounds were lower than 50%, independently of the investigated animal species. The host cell factor TMPRSS2 is of key importance for the cross-species spread of SARS-CoV-2. Studies of the in vitro biotransformation of TMPRSS2 inhibitors provide additional information for the development of new antiviral drugs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of the present study was to re-align the limbs, which can correct the length mismatch and reset the coherence of the joint with the aid of a 3-D phantom model for surgical preplanning. A 14-month-old, intact female Golden Retriever with an angular deformity of the left radius and ulna was selected for the study. The diagnosis was confirmed by orthogonal radiographs. Moreover, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a multiplane deformity with valgus, procurator, and external rotation of the left radius. The pre-surgical planning started with the quantification of the angular deformity, followed by a simulated virtual osteotomy, and concluded with an in vitro rehearsal surgery on 3-D printed phantom bone models. In the operating room, prefabricated patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) was attached at the planned site of the radial bone surface for a precise closing wedge osteotomy. Then two locking plates were fixed routinely. Post-operative radiographs showed accurate correction of the deformity as we had planned. At 12 weeks post-operatively, the follow-up surveys revealed improved gait, weight-bearing, and progression of bone healing. Our PSI design, based on novel surgical planning, was steady yet straightforward during the osteotomy. The osteotomy was performed without difficulty since the PSI that pre-determined the sites and angles let the surgeon perform the antebrachial malformation surgery. This method of operation reduces stress on the operator and helps to improve accuracy, repeatability, and surgery time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Uterine secretions and urine samples from 52 female dogs with pyometra were collected and cultured. Strains identified as E. coli from 25 uterine and 7 urine samples were tested for virulence genes by PCR. Genetic similarity between the isolates was studied using RAPD-PCR. E. coli was observed in 48.07% uterine samples with pyometra and 20.0% urine samples. The strains showed high percentages for the presence of virulence genes: 96.9% had the gene sfa, 59.4% afa, 46.9% pap, 53.1% hly, and 68.75% cnf. Even with the high prevalence of virulence genes, the samples were not submitted to DNA sequencing to confirm the results. Analysis showed high genetic diversity in E. coli, however, strains isolated from the same animal indicate that cystitis and pyometra could be related. Our study indicated the association between E. coli in dogs with pyometra and cases of urinary tract infection and the pathogenic potential of strains increasing with animal age.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This retrospective study aimed to describe the frequency of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial resistance profiles in salmonid aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results assessed by disk diffusion testing were summarized for 18,776 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) samples from 2291 unique cases submitted to the Atlantic Veterinary College, Aquatic Diagnostic Services Bacteriology Laboratory from 2000 to 2021. Kidney was the most commonly submitted tissue (60.29%, n = 11,320), and these specimens were mostly submitted as swabs (63.68%, n = 11,957). The most prevalent pathogens detected in these cases were Yersinia ruckeri type 1 (5.54%, n = 127), Renibacterium salmoninarum (2.10%, n = 48), Aeromonas salmonicida (atypical) (1.66%, n = 38), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1.22%, n = 28). Most bacterial isolates tested (n = 918) showed resistance to florfenicol, oxytetracycline, ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but not to enrofloxacin. This report provides baseline data for antimicrobial surveillance programs that investigate emerging antimicrobial resistance trends in salmonid aquaculture in Atlantic Canada.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35448658</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>First Detection and Identification of FAdV-8b as the Causative Agent of an Outbreak of Inclusion Body Hepatitis in a Commercial Broiler Farm in Greece.</Title>	<Abstract>Inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) is an economically important disease of chickens, with a worldwide distribution, caused by Fowl Aviadenoviruses (FAdVs). Currently, the increased number of cases, the virulence of the isolate strains, as well as the lack of cross-species protection highlight that detailed in-field data are fundamental for the development of successful control strategies. This case report provides a detailed clinicopathological investigation of an unusual IBH outbreak in a commercial broiler farm in the region of Macedonia, Greece. The farm consisted of 64,000 birds, originated from the same breeder stock and placed in three different houses (Flock A-C). At 20 days of age, a sudden increase in daily mortality was recorded in Flock A. It is worth mentioning that, although all flocks were serologically (indirect ELISA) and molecularly (RT-PCR) positive for FAdV, the mortality rate, attributed to IBH, was much higher in Flock A compared to others. The clinical manifestation included non-specific symptoms such as depression, inappetence, yellowish mucoid diarrhea, and lack of uniformity. At necropsy, typically, enlarged, pale, and friable livers were dominant, while sporadically lesions were recorded in the pancreas, kidneys, skeletal muscles, and lymphoid organs. The histopathological examination of liver samples showed multifocal inflammation, necrosis, and the presence of basophilic/ eosinophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. In addition, the loss of the architecture of pancreatic lobules and the presence of fibrosis and foci of mononuclear cell aggregates were suggestive of chronic pancreatic inflammation. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of FAdV, belonging to species E, serotype FAdV-8b. Performance and financial calculations revealed that IBH increased Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR), feed cost/chick as well as feed cost/kg live weight, whereas the Livability (%) and the European Production Efficiency Factor (EPEF) were decreased in the most severely affected flocks (Flock A). This study is the first report of the detection and identification of FAdV serotypes associated with IBH in commercial broiler flocks in Greece. However, there is still a lack of information about the circulating FAdV serotypes in the country, and therefore epidemiological studies are needed to establish control strategies for IBH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty Fresian dairy herds in the Perugia and Assisi districts were visited and an audit of herd management was conducted. Among the 50 herds, 20 were selected for the consistency of management practices and, according to the culling strategy, two groups were created: group A (aggressive culling protocol, with average herd productive life &lt;1100 days) and group B (lower culling rate, with productive life greater than 1500 days). The presence of antibodies to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) in the serum was determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. It was found that 3.3% (n = 14) of the cows of group B (n = 422, from 17 herds) were positive for Map antibodies, in comparison with 5.7% (n = 21) of the cows from group A (n = 366, from three herds). The odds ratio from multiple logistic regression (adjusted odds ratio 2.446, 95% confidence interval 0.412 to 14.525) showed that Johne&#8217;s disease prevalence in herds with a greater productive life was not higher than in herds with typical modern management characterized by more aggressive culling. This is a significant finding, indicating that aggressive culling may not be necessary. Current JD control recommendations are derived from data obtained in high-prevalence paratuberculosis areas (northern Europe, including northern Italy), while methods of information transfer to dairy farms in low-prevalence areas should be reassessed to ensure that the correct measures, including basic calving management and calf-rearing practices, are thoroughly implemented. Using the manufacturer&#8217;s suggested cut-off for a positive ELISA test and the sensitivity and specificity claimed, the overall true prevalence in Umbria dairy cattle was calculated as 7% (95% confidence interval 5.2% to 8.8%).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A temperature&#8722;humidity index (THI) is required to assess and evaluate heat stress levels in livestock. One of the livestock types in Thailand experiencing heat stress due to extreme climate change is crossbred dairy cattle. Genetic evaluations of heat tolerance in dairy cattle have been carried out for reproductive traits. Heritability values for reproductive traits are generally low (&lt;0.10) because environmental factors heavily influence them. Consequently, genetic improvement for these traits would be slow compared to production traits. Positive and negative genetic correlations were found between reproductive traits and reproductive traits and yield traits. Several selection methods for reproductive traits have been introduced, i.e., the traditional method, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS). GS is the most promising technique and provides accurate results with a high genetic gain. Single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) has higher accuracy than the multi-step equivalent for fertility traits or low-heritability traits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study purposed to provide information on MBM including either coarsely (MBMc) or finely (MBMf) ground with regard to diet digestibility and fecal characteristics in dogs. Three different levels of MBM (6%, 12% and 24%) of each grinding form (MBM6, MBM12 and MBM24) were added to a basic diet. Six Beagle dogs (body weight 16.7 kg &#177; 0.42) participated in a Latin Square experiment. Each trial began with the animals adapting to the food for a five-day period, followed by five days of fecal collection. The feed particle size had no effect on the apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein and crude fat. The fecal score was significantly affected by the particle size &#215; level interaction among treatments (p &lt; 0.0001). It was noted that the different particle sizes or levels of MBM as main effects had no significant effect on the fecal fatty acid concentrations. These findings suggest that using coarse or fine grinding even including MBM up to 24% in dog diets does not affect the apparent digestibility of protein nor fecal quality negatively in our experimental study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lineage 1 PRRSV includes virulent strains such as NADC30 and MN184 and now has become one of the most prevalent viruses in Korea. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop a new vaccine for Korean lineage-1 strains. In this study, a vaccine candidate against Korean lineage-1 PRRSV, vCSL1-GP5-N33D, was developed by reverse genetics technology. vCSL1-GP5-N33D was designed as a hypo-glycosylated chimeric virus containing the glycoprotein 5 ectodomain region of the Korean lineage-1 wild-type strain. An inactivated vaccine of vCSL1-GP5-N33D was applied to a PRRS-endemic farm and elicited high serum virus neutralization (SVN) antibody titers. The vaccinated group induced SVN antibody titers of 4.40 (log2) &#177; 2.46, which were approximately 2-fold higher than those of the negative control at 8-weeks post-vaccination. Moreover, 60% of pigs in the vaccinated group displayed SVN antibody titers of &#8805;5 (log2), while none of the pigs in the negative control exhibited SVN antibody titers of &#8805;5 (log2). The overall results of the animal experiment suggest that the vCSL1-GP5-N33D inactivated vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease is prevalent worldwide, causing huge economic losses to the cattle industry. Gene-deficient vaccines with immunological markers to distinguish them from wild-type infections have become a mainstream in vaccine research and development. In order to knock out the gE gene BoHV-1, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Interesting phenomena were observed at the single guide RNA (sgRNA) splicing site, including gene insertion, gene deletion, and the inversion of 5' and 3' ends of the sgRNA splicing site. In addition to the deletion of the gE gene, the US9 gene, and the non-coding regions of gE and US9, it was found that the US4 sequence, US6 sequence, and part of the US7 sequence were inserted into the EGFP sgRNA splicing site and the 3' end of the EGFP sequence was deleted. Similar to the BoHV-1 parent, the BoHV-1 mutants induced high neutralizing antibodies titer levels in mice. In summary, we developed a series of recombinant gE-deletion BoHV-1 samples using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. The mutant viruses with EGFP[+] or EGFP[-] will lay the foundation for research on BoHV-1 and vaccine development in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data from Vet-OncoNet.</Title>	<Abstract>The animal cancer burden is essential for the translational value of companion animals in comparative oncology. The present work aims to describe, analyze, and compare frequencies and associations of tumors in dogs and cats based on the Animal Cancer Registry created by Vet-OncoNet. With 9079 registries, regarding 2019 and 2020, 81% (n = 7355) belonged to dogs. In comparison, cats have a general one-year right advance in the mean age of cancer diagnosis compared to dogs. The multivariate topography group analysis shows a distinct pattern between the two species: dogs have higher odds of cancer in the genito-urinary system, spleen, soft tissue tumors and skin, while cats show higher odds for tumors in the eyes, digestive organs, nasal cavity, lymph nodes, bones and mammary glands. Regarding morphologies, dogs are overrepresented in mast cell tumors (MCT), melanomas, and hemangiosarcomas. While cats are overrepresented in fibrosarcomas, lymphomas (T and B-cell), in malignant mammary tumors, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Females have greater odds only in the mammary gland, with males having greater odds in six of twelve topographies. This study is the first outcome of continuous animal cancer registration studies in Portugal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-two cases of feline epitheliotropic duodenal T-cell lymphoma were characterized morphologically and immunohistochemically (CD3, Pax5, Ki-67), and Bcl-2 immunoexpression was established. Most cases were in domestic shorthair cats (88.2%), with a mean age of 11.2 years. All lymphomas were CD3+, with a low-to-moderate expression of Ki-67 (&lt;30%). A correlation between the tumoral pattern of infiltration in the lamina propria and the intraepithelial distribution of the neoplastic lymphocytes was established (p = 0.0155). Intraepithelial nests of neoplastic lymphocytes were predominantly observed in lymphomas with a patchy distribution in the lamina propria, whereas intraepithelial plaques were seen in lymphomas with an obliteration pattern. Bcl-2 was expressed in neoplastic cells in all cases, and a higher expression was associated with increased villous stunting (p = 0.0221), and tended to be present in those cases with increased epithelial damage. The expression of Bcl-2 and the degree of epitheliotropism were correlated with neoplastic progression in epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphomas; those displaying high Bcl-2 immunoexpression showed increased villous stunting and epithelial damage, suggesting that Bcl-2 is overexpressed in advanced tumor stages, and may be used as a predictor of tumoral behavior in feline epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphomas. This entity showed many similarities with human MEITL, so the latter entity should be considered in further lymphoma classifications of domestic animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, little is known about the gut microbiota and metabolite composition and development throughout pregnancy and lactation. Here, we used amplicon sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota composition of 35 female mice in five stages of pregnancy and lactation, namely, non-receptive (NR) stages, sexually-receptive (SR) stages, at day 15 of pregnancy (Pre_D15), at the day of birth (Del), and at day 10 of lactation (Lac_D10). The results revealed that the &#945; diversity of gut microbiota was significantly increased during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) conducted on the amplicon sequence variants' (ASVs') distribution of the 16S rRNA amplicons indicated that the microbiota composition was significantly different among the five groups. Based on a random forest analysis, Oscillospira, Dehalobacterium, and Alistipes were the most important microbiota. The abundance of Allobaculum, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus were negatively correlated with the serum progesterone concentration, while the abundance of Oscillospira was positively correlated with the propionate and valerate concentration in the caecal contents. Moreover, the concentration of acetate and propionate in the Del and Lac_D10 stages was significantly lower than in the SR and Pre_D15 stages. Our findings indicate that some gut microbes and metabolites vary considerably at the different stages of pregnancy and during lactation stages, which can potentially be used as microbial biomarkers. These results provide information on the potential use of the identified microbes as probiotics to maintain a healthy pregnancy and lactation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35448668</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Welfare Assessment Tools in Zoos: From Theory to Practice.</Title>	<Abstract>Zoos are increasingly implementing formalized animal welfare assessment programs to allow monitoring of welfare over time, as well as to aid in resource prioritization. These programs tend to rely on assessment tools that incorporate resource-based and observational animal-focused measures. A narrative review of the literature was conducted to bring together recent studies examining welfare assessment methods in zoo animals. A summary of these methods is provided, with advantages and limitations of the approaches presented. We then highlight practical considerations with respect to implementation of these tools into practice, for example scoring schemes, weighting of criteria, and innate animal factors for consideration. It is concluded that there would be value in standardizing guidelines for development of welfare assessment tools since zoo accreditation bodies rarely prescribe these. There is also a need to develop taxon or species-specific assessment tools to complement more generic processes and more directly inform welfare management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Indeed, NPY has been shown to be involved in the regulation of feed intake and energy homeostasis by exerting stimulatory effects on appetite and feeding behavior in several species including chickens, rabbits, rats and mouse. More recent studies have shown that this neuropeptide and its receptors are expressed in various peripheral tissues, including the thyroid, heart, spleen, adrenal glands, white adipose tissue, muscle and bone. Although well researched centrally, studies investigating the distribution and function of peripherally expressed NPY in avian (non-mammalian vertebrates) species are very limited. Thus, peripherally expressed NPY merits more consideration and further in-depth exploration to fully elucidate its functions, especially in non-mammalian species. The aim of the current review is to provide an integrated synopsis of both centrally and peripherally expressed NPY, with a special focus on the distribution and function of the latter.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

E-cad expression was examined immunohistochemically in a series of canine tissue samples, including normal gastric mucosa (NGM; n = 3), gastric carcinomas (GC; n = 33), adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM; n = 32), neoplastic emboli (n = 16) and metastatic lesions (n = 9). The relationship between E-cad expression and clinicopathological features were investigated. In NGM, epithelial cells showed strong latero-lateral membranous expression of E-cad, and this pattern was considered normal. The membranous staining was preserved in all specimens of NNM (100%), whereas abnormal E-cad expression was found in 87.9% of the GCs. A marked difference in E-cad expression was observed between normal and malignant tissues (p &lt; 0.0002). Abnormal E-cad expression was significantly more frequent in poorly/undifferentiated carcinomas (96%) and diffuse (95%) and indeterminate carcinomas (100%) than in well-differentiated/intestinal ones (62.5%; p = 0.0115 and p = 0.0392, respectively). There was significant association between abnormal E-cad expression and the depth of invasion (p = 0.0117), and the presence neoplastic emboli (p = 0.0194). No statistically significant differences in E-cad expression were observed concerning tumor location, histological type according to WHO classification, and presence of metastatic lesions. Therefore, deregulation of E-cad expression may play a role in canine gastric carcinogenesis and in tumor progression; moreover, it might be a prognostic tool for canine gastric cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The significance of the pathogen as a cause of uterine infections in cattle has been little studied so far. Here, we analyzed the association between a pathological puerperium in cattle and the detection of C. perfringens in a prospective longitudinal study. Clostridium perfringens were only found in vaginal and uterine samples of diseased cattle, and were absent in healthy controls. Isolates (n = 21) were tested for the production of major toxins (alpha-, beta-, epsilon-toxin) by ELISA and for the potential of production of major (alpha-, beta-, iota-toxin) and minor toxins (beta2 toxin) by PCR. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility was also tested phenotypically by microdilution. Despite the frequent use of tetracycline treatment in cows suffering from puerperal disorders, no isolate showed phenotypic tetracycline resistance. Most isolates did not release major amounts of toxin. The strict association of C. perfringens with puerperal disease, together with the absence of major toxins might hint towards a major role of other or unknown clostridial virulence factors in uterine disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty horses were assigned to three groups prior to oral cheek tooth extraction. Horses were treated with acepromazine, followed by a detomidine bolus, one of the three opioids and both a nerve block and gingival anaesthesia. During the surgery, sedation was maintained with a detomidine constant rate infusion. After surgery, the quality of sedation, surgical conditions and severity of the extraction were assessed with a numerical rating scale. To evaluate differences in the quality of analgesia between the three treatments, postoperative pain was estimated with the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Facial Assessment of Pain. Additionally, several parameters that are associated with dental pain were added to this validated pain score, and blood samples were taken to measure serum cortisol. Our analysis showed lower pain scores and a greater analgesic effect with levomethadone and buprenorphine compared with butorphanol, with increased locomotor activity induced by buprenorphine. While cortisol values demonstrated higher response in horses treated with levomethadone and buprenorphine compared to butorphanol, these values could be biased by unrelated stressors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35448673</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Diagnosis and Prognosis of Canine Melanocytic Neoplasms.</Title>	<Abstract>Canine melanocytic neoplasms have a highly variable biological behavior ranging from benign cutaneous melanocytomas to malignant oral melanomas that readily metastasize to lymph nodes and internal organs. This review focuses on the diagnosis and prognosis of canine melanocytic neoplasms. While pigmented melanocytic neoplasms can be diagnosed with fine-needle aspirates, an accurate prognosis requires surgical biopsy. However, differentiating amelanotic spindloid melanomas from soft tissue sarcomas is challenging and often requires immunohistochemical labeling with a diagnostic cocktail that contains antibodies against Melan-A, PNL-2, TRP-1, and TRP-2 as the current gold standard. For questionable cases, RNA expression analysis for TYR, CD34, and CALD can further differentiate these two entities. The diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas will be aided by submitting overlying and/or lateral flanking epithelium to identify junctional activity. Wide excision of lateral flanking epithelium is essential, as lentiginous spread is common for malignant mucosal melanomas. Combining histologic features (nuclear atypia, mitotic count, degree of pigmentation, level of infiltration, vascular invasion; tumor thickness and ulceration) with the Ki67 index provides the most detailed prognostic assessment. Sentinel lymph nodes should be evaluated in cases of suspected malignant melanomas using serial sectioning of the node combined with immunohistochemical labeling for Melan-A and PNL-2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These viruses have been detected in pigs with or without clinical signs and often occur as coinfections. Despite the potential public health risks, no assay for detecting them all at once has been developed. Hence, in this study, a multiplex RT-PCR (mRT-PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of SaV, EMCV, RVA and AstV from swine fecal samples. The PCR parameters were optimized using specific primers for each target virus. The assay's sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and application to field samples have been evaluated. Using a pool of plasmids containing the respective viral target fragments as a template, the developed mRT-PCR successfully detected 2.5 &#215; 10[3] copies of each target virus. The assay's specificity was tested using six other swine viruses as a template and did not show any cross-reactivity. A total of 280 field samples were tested with the developed mRT-PCR assay. Positive rates for SaV, EMCV, RVA, and AstV were found to be 24.6% (69/280), 5% (14/280), 4.3% (12/280), and 17.5% (49/280), respectively. Compared to performing separate assays for each virus, this mRT-PCR assay is a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting mixed or single infections of SaV, EMCV, RVA, and AstV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Protamine-induced hypotension (PIH) during cardiac anesthesia has been reported in humans. The purpose of this study was to describe the hemodynamic effect of protamine administration in dogs during cardiac surgery in clinical cases. Study design: Retrospective, clinical, cohort study. A total of 14 client-owned dogs who suffered heart failure due to medically uncontrolled myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) were included in this study. The severity of MMVD was classified according to American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine staging (ACVIM: stage B2, C, D) and dogs undergoing mitral valve surgery. Records with clinical data for dogs treated between July 2019 to August 2020 were examined for age, sex, breed, body weight, concurrent diseases, hospitalization, anesthetic record, and mortality within 3 months after the operation. PIH was defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) lowered by 20% of that before protamine infusion. To evaluate the effect of protamine on hemodynamic variables, each of the other values was compared with values at the beginning of protamine infusion. MAP decreased by 41.0 and 45.7% in two dogs (14.3%) compared with pressure before protamine infusion. Others did not show obvious alteration in hemodynamic variables. Epinephrine treatment alleviated hypotension in one dog. Another dog with systemic hypotension concomitant with elevated central venous pressure did not respond to epinephrine treatment and a reboot of extracorporeal circulation was required. Reheparinization and reinstitution of cardiopulmonary bypass successfully resuscitate the second dog. In conclusion, clinicians should alert the incidence of severe hypotension even with slow protamine infusion following canine cardiac surgery. This study also provides two effective treatments for catastrophic hypotension during protamine infusion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Activity of DGGR-lipase (10&#8722;15,616 U/L) and cPL concentrations (8.1&#8722;&#8805;2000 &#181;g/L) were highly correlated (rs = 0.91). Areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) to predict cPL &gt;200 and &#8805;400 &#181;g/L with DGGR-lipase were 0.97 and 0.99, with optimal cutoffs of 143 U/L (sensitivity (Se) 91.7%; specificity (Sp) 95.3%) and 205 U/L (Se 97.5%; Sp 96.4%), and Cohen&#8217;s kappa agreements of 0.87 and 0.92, respectively. AUCs for a clinical diagnosis of AP, assigned to 87/301 dogs, with DGGR-lipase (0.75) and cPL (0.76) did not differ significantly (p = 0.48); optimal cutoffs were 161 U/L for DGGR (Se 67%; Sp 81%) and 235 &#181;g/L for cPL (Se 68%; Sp 84%). To conclude, DGGR-lipase is a highly accurate predictor of cPL with a comparable performance when used to diagnose AP in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35448677</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Inter- and Intra-Observer Variations in Radiographic Evaluation of Pelvic Limbs in Yorkshire Terriers with Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture and Patellar Luxation.</Title>	<Abstract>The main aims of the study were to describe bone alignment differences in Yorkshire Terriers (YT) with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR), patellar luxation (PL), or with a combination of both (CCLR + PL); to verify the theory of increased strain on cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) due to PL as a predisposing factor; and to evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability of the protocols developed for measurement of femoral and tibial alignment in Yorkshire Terriers. Fifty-five hindlimbs of YT were divided into four groups: Control, CCLR, PL, and CCLR + PL. Thirty parameters were radiographically evaluated including hip joint, femoral, tibial, and intercondylar fossa (ICF) parameters. Three observers evaluated all parameters on two separate occasions with a twelve-week interval between measurements. Significant differences in conjunction with CCLR and PL theories between groups were noticed in: Norberg angle (NA), quadriceps angle (Qa), anatomic lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA), femoral varus (FVA), mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrPTA), mechanical caudal proximal tibial angle (mCdPTA), tibial plateau angle (TPA), distal tibial axis/proximal tibial axis angle (DPA). Some interesting findings are the similarity of values between Control and CCLR vs. CCLR + PL and PL groups in Na, Qa, aLDFA; between CCLR + PL and PL in FVA and a significantly lower age of dogs in CCLR + PL compared to CCLR group. Based on our results, we can conclude that YT with different clinical findings have differing bone morphology. Moreover, these findings may support PL as a predisposing factor for CCLR in small breeds. Measurements in which excellent inter- observer agreement was achieved may be used for surgical planning or for further discussions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the traditional MMT, a pin is used for the fixation of the fragment of the osteotomized tibia to the implant and the tibial diaphysis; this pin needs to be placed below the insertion of the patellar ligament to avoid damaging it. Considering the differences between TTA and MMT, the authors consider it important to determine the incidence of patellar desmopathy in the MMT. This is a prospective study that enrolled 53 owned dogs that underwent MMT and were followed up by a complete examination and radiograph controls to establish the patellar tendon thickening and the presence of clinical desmitis. The PRGF were administrated to 29 of those patients, in order to determine if PRGF's action could decrease ligament desmitis. The conclusions in this study were that the desmopathy produced by the MMT is similar to that generated by the TTA if the pin is carefully placed; in addition, the PRGF did not decrease the inflammation and the thickening of the ligament.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 120 pullets, 17 weeks of age, were assigned to two groups (Control&#8212;C; Treated&#8212;T, n = 60 each). For 12 weeks, the T group received a diet supplemented with 0.3% of dry extracts of Bs (5%) and Sa (5%). The study lasted 19 weeks. Productive performance, serum analytes, H/L ratio, IgA and anti-IBV antibodies were investigated. Water intake was significantly higher, while body and egg weight was significantly lower for the T group (p &lt; 0.05). No other differences were detected in performance parameters, serum analytes, IgA and H/L ratio excluding t0, with a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher H/R ratio and higher titers of anti-IBV antibody for the T group. Overall, the data obtained in this study show that the supplementation with Bs and Sa was safe and resulted in an increase in water consumption, a decrease in egg weight, and a sedative effect in the hens. In the future, it would be interesting to test this supplement in hens reared on intensive farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To date, efficacious control measures to reduce Campylobacter prevalence are still missing. A potential approach to control Campylobacter in modern poultry productions is to occupy its niche in the mucosal layer by administering live intestinal microbiota from adult chickens to dayold-chicks (competitive exclusion (CE)). Therefore, this in vivo study investigates the efficacy of a complex CE culture to reduce Campylobacter (C.) jejuni colonization in broiler chickens. For this purpose, the complex CE culture was applied twice: once by spray application to day-old chicks immediately after hatching (on the 1st day of life) and subsequently by an additional application via drinking water on the 25th day of life. We observed a consistent and statistically significant reduction of C. jejuni counts in cloacal swabs throughout the entire fattening period. At the end of the trial after necropsy (at 33 days of age), C. jejuni cecal counts also showed a statistically significant decrease of 1 log10 MPN/g compared to the control group. Likewise, colon counts were reduced by 2.0 log10 MPN/g. These results suggest that CE cultures can be considered a practically relevant control strategy to reduce C. jejuni colonization in broiler chickens on poultry farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The hornet hunts honeybees to feed its larvae, stressing and weakening the honeybee colonies. To avoid losses of honeybee colonies, it is essential to investigate the pressure that is exerted by the yellow-legged hornet on apiaries and its consequences. In the present study, hives were monitored in an apiary that was situated in a high-pressure area of V. velutina during the years 2020 and 2021. The monitoring of environmental conditions of the apiary, the internal conditions of the colonies, and a hunting camera were used to relate the presence of hornets in front of the hives to the weather conditions in the apiary and the consequences caused on the colonies. The relationships between weather conditions and the hornet's activity showed two types of hornet behavior. In the months of July and August, the maximum number of hornets appeared in non-central hours of the day. Meanwhile, in the months of September and October, the highest pressure in the apiary occurred in the central hours of the day, coinciding with temperatures between 15 &#176;C and 25 &#176;C and a relative humidity that was higher than 60%. The honeybee colony with the highest thermoregulatory capacity was the strongest and it was the key factor for the colony survival even when the hornet pressure was high too. Therefore, strengthening the hives and improving beehive health status is essential to avoid colonies decline.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The performance of an ear cleaner was assessed over two weeks in canine ECOE, associated with a mild or moderate secondary infection, in a prospective open-label study. Forty ear canals with ECOE that did not receive any type of aural treatment and were not cleaned for 7 days were included. Pruritus (PS), 0&#8722;3 Otitis Index Score (OTIS-3) and 0&#8722;4 scale cytology (CYTO) scores were assessed on Day (D) 0, D7 and D14. Concentrations of a panel of 13 cytokines on the ear canal surface and the lipid profile of the exudate were measured on D0 and D14. From D0 to D12 or D13, the dogs&#8217; ears were cleaned daily if the secretion score (SEC) was 3/3, every second day if the score was 2/3 and every third day if the score was 1/3. PS, OTIS-3, SEC and CYTO were significantly lower on D7 compared to baseline (&#8722;40%, &#8722;31%, &#8722;36%, &#8722;34%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). The same parameters decreased further on D14 (&#8722;60%, &#8722;53%, &#8722;61%, &#8722;73%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) and amounts of interleukin 8 and chemokine KC-like were also reduced compared to baseline (&#8722;45%, p &lt; 0.01; &#8722;36%, p = 0.3, respectively).

The reproductive efficiency of mares has significant implications for a breeding operation's economic success, and widespread losses can have a trickle-down effect on those communities that rely on equine breeding operations. Understanding the causes and risks of equine pregnancy loss is essential for developing prevention and management strategies to reduce the occurrence and impact on the horse breeding industry. This PRISMA-guided scoping review identified 514 records on equine pregnancy loss and described the global spatiotemporal distribution of reported causes and syndromes. The multiple correspondence analysis identified seven clusters that grouped causes, syndromes, locations and pathology. Reasons for clustering should be the focus of future research as they might indicate undescribed risk factors associated with equine pregnancy loss. People engaged in the equine breeding industry work closely with horses and encounter equine bodily fluids, placental membranes, aborted foetuses, and stillborn foals. This close contact increases the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. Based on this review, research is required on equine abortion caused by zoonotic bacteria, including Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp., because of the severe illness that can occur in people who become infected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we retrospectively collected 310 canine lymphomas with an aberrant phenotype detected via flow cytometry and describe their clinical and clinical pathological features at diagnosis. There were 152 T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (T-NOS), 101 T-zone lymphomas (TZL), 54 B-cell lymphomas, and 3 cases with two suspected concurrent neoplastic populations. The most represented aberrancies were: CD5-, CD4-CD8-, and CD3- in T-NOS lymphomas, CD21+, CD4-CD8-, and CD3- in TZLs, and CD34+, CD44-, and CD5+ in B-cell lymphomas. Among T-cell lymphomas, the aberrant expression of CD21 was significantly more frequent in TZL and the loss of CD5 and CD44 in T-NOS. More than 75% of dogs were purebred; males outnumbered females; the mean age at diagnosis was 8-10 years, depending on lymphoma subtype. A few dogs were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and 30% had peripheral blood abnormalities, in line with what is already reported for the general population of dogs with lymphoma. Further studies are needed to assess the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying each specific antigen aberrancy, as well as the diagnostic and prognostic role.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, and for the first time in Korea, the prevalence of EAdV-1 in equine nasal swabs was investigated using a PCR to identify potential risk factors and examine the genetic diversity of its DNA sequences by a comparison with foreign strains. Nasal swabs collected from 359 horses reared at Korea Racing Authority facilities were tested using an EAdV-1 hexon-specific PCR and the associations between EAdV-1 infection and sex, age, region, breed, and activity were analyzed. Five samples (1.4%, 5/359) tested positive for EAdV-1; however, no statistically significant differences were observed with respect to any variable. Among the five EAdV-1-positive horses, a co-infection with equine influenza, equine herpesvirus 1 and 4, or Streptococcus equi was not detected; however, clinical respiratory signs were observed in one. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial EAdV-1 hexon gene sequences revealed that the Korean EAdV-1 isolates shared approximately 98.8-100% similarity among each other and with foreign strains. Three Korean isolates shared high similarity with strains from Australia and India and the remaining two isolates were separate in phylogenetic analyses. These findings highlight the molecular prevalence and genetic diversity of EAdV-1 in horses in Korea.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Wood model was used for fitting the lactation curve of 398,449 DHI test-day milk fat percentage records of Holstein cows from 2018 to 2020 in 12 dairy farms in Jiangsu province, and the influencing factors&#8212;including farm size, parity, calving season, calving interval, and 305-days milk production&#8212;on the parameters of the lactation curve were analyzed. The results showed that the non-genetic factors such as dairy farm size, calving season, parity, calving interval, and 305-days milk yield have a significant impact on milk fat percentage (p &lt; 0.01); the average R2 of the daily milk fat percentage curve was 0.9699; the lowest milk fat percentage was 3.54%; the time to reach the lowest milk fat percentage was 126 days; and the persistence of milk fat percentage was 3.59%. All of these factors explored in this study fit at different levels above 0.96. The Wood model performed well in the fitting and analysis of the milk fat percentage curve of Holstein cattle in Jiangsu Province. This study provides a reference for improving the milk fat percentage of Holstein cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35448687</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Fertility Rate and Assessment of the Cytoprotective Capacity of Various Types of Holothuroidea Extracts on Spermatozoa.</Title>	<Abstract>For years, compounds of natural origin have been the subject of extensive biomedical research due to very interesting, new ingredients potentially useful for various pharmaceutical, medical and industrial applications. The therapeutic properties and healing benefits of sea cucumbers may result from the presence of numerous, biologically active ingredients. Sperm subjected to processing and subsequent storage at low temperatures experience a number of damage, including the loss of the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane, DNA and acrosome defragmentation. Therefore, the aim of this experiment was to investigate the cytoprotective potential of sea cucumber extract against cryopreserved sperm and semen fertility rate. Commercially available sea cucumber extract was taken from the cellulose shell, then 790 mg of powder was weighed out and placed in 3 glass tubes containing, respectively: 10 mL of water-glycerin solution (WG), water-ethanol (EC), glycerin-ethanol (GE), glycerin-DMSO (DG). Tubes were mixed with vortex for 3 min, then placed in a water bath and incubated for 16 h at 40 &#176;C. Six simmental bulls, 3 years old, of known health status were used for the experiment. Semen was collected from each male once a week (for 18 weeks) using an artificial vagina. After an initial assessment of semen quality, the ejaculates were pooled to eliminate individual differences between males, then diluted to a final concentration of 80 &#215; 10[6] sperm/mL with a commercial extender (Optixcell, IMV, L'Aigle, France) and divided into 16 equal samples. Control (C) without additive, the test samples contained 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 &#181;L WG, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 &#181;L WE, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 &#181;L GE, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 &#181;L DG. Semen was frozen/thawed and assessed for motility, viability, DNA defragmentation, mitochondrial membrane potential and acrosome integrity. It was shown a positive effect of water-glycerin (WG) and glycerine-ethanol (GE) extracts on the efficiency of sperm preservation at low temperatures. Established that, depending on the type of prepared extract, the sea cucumber can have both cytoprotective (WG, GE, WE) and cytotoxic (DG) effects. Moreover, too high concentrations of the extract can adversely affect the sperm in terms of parameters such as viability, motility, mitochondrial potential, and the integrity of the acrosome or DNA of cells. The present study, thanks to the use of model animals to study the cytoprotective potential of the sea cucumber extract, proves that it can be a potential candidate for use in semen cryopreservation technology to improve the efficiency of storage at low temperatures. Further research is needed to optimize the composition of individual types of extracts and their effect on sperm. The highest effectiveness of female fertilization was observed when doses from GE groups (2 and 4) were used for insemination. The results of this analysis prove that the addition of the tested extract may improve the fertilization efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bama and Banna miniature pigs are the two Chinese miniature pig breeds that have been developed as laboratory animal models for studying virus infection, pathogenesis, and vaccine evaluation. However, the PoIFN complex of such miniature pig breeds remains to be studied. In the present study, we cloned PoIFN-&#946; genes from Bama and Banna miniature pigs, detected their PoIFN-&#946; tissue expression profiles, prepared recombinant PoIFN-&#946; (rPoIFN-&#946;) using the E. coli expression system, and measured their antiviral activities against three different pig viruses. At the amino acid sequence level, PoIFN-&#946;s of the two miniature pig breeds were identical, which shared 100% identity with that of Congjiang Xiang pigs, 99.4-100% identity with that of domestic pigs, and 99.5% identity with that of three species of African wild boars. The tissue expression profiles of PoIFN-&#946; mRNA differed not only between the two miniature pig breeds but between miniature pigs and domestic pigs as well. The four promoter domains of PoIFN-&#946; of the two miniature pig breeds were identical with that of humans, domestic pigs, and three species of African wild boars. The recombinant PoIFN-&#946; prepared from the two miniature pig breeds showed dose-dependent pre-infection and post-infection antiviral activities against vesicular stomatitis virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, and pig pseudorabies virus. This study provided evidence for the high sequence conservation of PoIFN-&#946; genes within the Suidae family with different tissue expression profiles and antiviral activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The diagnosis is usually performed combining neurological signs and imaging findings. The aim of the present study is to describe the abnormal neurological signs, the diagnostic imaging findings, based on Computed Tomography (CT) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and the outcome in a population of dogs with suspected PA. Clinical cases were retrospectively reviewed. Nineteen cases of suspected PA were included. The majority of dogs showed behavioural abnormalities (11/19). Neurological signs more frequently identified were obtundation (7/19), vestibular signs (7/19) and epileptic seizures (6/19). The onset of neurological signs was per-acute in 14 out of 19 cases. Data regarding CT and MRI were available in 18 and 9 cases, respectively. Neurological signs resolved in less than 24 h in seven patients. The short-term prognosis was defined as favourable in the majority of our study population. The median survival time was of 7 months from the time of PA diagnosis. This is the first description of neurological signs, imaging findings and outcome in a large group of dogs with PA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Altogether 38 Holstein cows were enrolled in this study (Moocall&#174; group: 16 heifers and 8 cows; control group: 9 heifers and 5 cows). Clinical examinations were performed every 6 h over the 7 days period before the predicted calving date. The examined traits were changes in pelvic ligament relaxation, edema of the vulva, teat filling, vaginal secretion, tail tip flexibility, tail raising and behavior. There were no significant differences in Moocall&#174; alerts between heifers and cows. The time lag between the first warning of Moocall&#174; and the onset of labor was 21.2 &#177; 20.2 h (max: 95.4 h; min: 0.1 h; p = 0.87) for heifers and 29.6 &#177; 29.6 h (max: 177.8 h; min: 0 h; p = 0.97) for cows. Linear models including Moocall&#174; alerts showed a significantly better fit to the time until calving than models without Moocall&#174; information (without variable selection: p = 0.030, with variable selection: p &lt; 0.01). In the best-fitting model, class 2 alerts (enhanced tail activity over 2 h) contributed with a higher significance (p &lt; 0.01). Vice versa, models including additional traits were outperformed the use of Moocall&#174; alerts alone. In the best fitting model, class 2 alerts (enhanced tail activity during 2 h) contributed with a higher significance (p &lt; 0.01) than any of the best clinical predictive parameters, such as pelvic ligament relaxation (p = 0.01), tail tip flexibility (p = 0.01) or behavior (p = 0.01).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess the infection rate of Brucella spp. in ruminants and to evaluate the agreement between a serological test and a molecular method for the detection of infected cases. Blood and milk samples of 136 ruminants were analyzed using two laboratory methods: the Rose Bengal plate (RBP) test to detect B. abortus and B. melitensis antibodies and the molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the presence of bacterial DNA. The agreement between the methods was assessed using the kappa statistic. Based on the RBP test, there were 12 (8.8%) seropositive animals (10 sheep and 2 cows), while 2 (1.4%) samples were positive on PCR analysis. The positive PCR samples were from seronegative cow samples on RBP testing. There was slight agreement (k = -0.02) between the two methods, which was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that complementary molecular methods are useful to detect the bacteria in infected animals that are seronegative due to an early stage of infection. Therefore, a combination of molecular methods and serological tests can be applied to detect brucellosis in ruminants efficiently.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to perform a molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) isolated from dairy cows presenting LSD-like clinical signs in northern Thailand. The skin nodules were collected from 26 LSD-suspected cows involved in six outbreaks during the period from July to September of 2021. LSDVs were confirmed from clinical samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR-positive samples were subsequently amplified and sequenced using a G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) gene for molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses. All 26 samples were positive for LSDV by PCR. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 24 LSDV isolates obtained from cattle in northern Thailand were closely related to other LSDV sequences acquired from Asia (China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam). On the other hand, two LSDV isolates of the cows presenting LSD-like clinical signs after vaccination were clustered along with LSDV Neethling-derived vaccines. The outcomes of this research will be beneficial in developing effective control strategies for LSDV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Between September and October 2020, 1154 individuals completed an online survey via Qualtrics. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between owner demographics and perceptions of zoonoses and SARS-CoV-2. Most participants were minimally concerned about their pets contracting or transmitting zoonotic diseases or SARS-CoV-2, although perceptions of risk differed based on age, race, and education. Older participants were typically less concerned about the transmission of zoonotic diseases and SARS-CoV-2. Considering where participants obtained information about zoonoses, pet owners were more likely to contact their veterinarian for advice (43%) than their physician (17%). However, 17% of pet owners struggled to access veterinary care, and 51% said their access to veterinary care had become more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight a need for further education about zoonoses and SARS-CoV-2, and suggest veterinarians may play a key role in these communications. The results also emphasize the need to address access to care issues in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This critical review aimed to evaluate the current literature and provide treatment recommendations and possible suggestions for future canine OMM research. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched in June 2021, for terms relevant to treatment of OMM. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and information on clinical response and outcome extracted. Eighty-one studies were included. The overall level of evidence supporting the various canine OMM treatment options was low. The majority of studies included confounding treatment modalities and lacked randomization, control groups and consistency in reporting clinical response and outcomes. Within these limitations, surgery remains the mainstay of therapy. Adjunctive radiotherapy provided good local control and improved median survival times (MST), chemotherapy did not offer survival benefit beyond that of surgery, while electrochemotherapy may offer a potential alternative to radiotherapy. Immunotherapy holds the most promise in extending MST in the surgical adjunctive setting, in particular the combination of gene therapy and autologous vaccination. Prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trials, with a lack of confounding factors and reporting based on established guidelines would allow comparison and recommendations for the treatment of canine OMM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there are few reports regarding the pathogenicity of Rothia nasimurium. In September 2020, geese contracted a disease of unknown cause which brought economic losses to a farm in Jiangsu Province, China, prompting a series of investigations. The bacterium was isolated, cultured, and purified, and then identified using Gram staining, biochemical tests, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. After determining the obtained bacteria species, antibiotic susceptibility tests and animal regression experiments were carried out. A strain of bacterium was successfully isolated from the livers of the diseased geese, which was identified as a strain of the Gram-positive bacterium Rothia nasimurium according to the 16S rRNA sequencing results. By indexing references, no goose was reported to have been infected with Rothia nasimurium. The antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that only four antibiotics (amikacin, cefazolin, fosfomycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam) could effectively inhibit the growth of the Rothia nasimurium strain. The animal regression experiments showed that the novel isolated strain could infect goslings, and it also causes serious depilation of goslings. The results of the manuscript expanded the range of pathogenic microorganisms in geese, which is helpful to develop methods for avian endemic control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622726</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serum Amyloid A Concentrations of Healthy and Clinically Diseased Japanese Black Breeding Cattle-Preliminary Measurements for Determining the Cut-Off Concentrations.</Title>	<Abstract>The present study aimed to compare serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations of Japanese Black (JB) breeding cows in both clinically normal and diseased cows diagnosed by veterinarians using modified latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay (LATIA) to determine the cut-off values for healthy and diseased JB cows. For the comparison, a total of 289 serum samples of healthy cows without any clinical symptoms intended for the metabolic profile test and 66 serums from diseased cows clinically diagnosed by veterinarians were measured for the SAA concentrations. A significant difference (p-value = 6.68 &#215; 10[-29]) was observed in the mean SAA concentrations between the healthy (2.8 &#177; 3.2 mg/L) and diseased (54.8 &#177; 76.8 mg/L) groups, and the median concentrations of the healthy and diseased groups were 1.5 mg/L and 31.2 mg/L, respectively. Finally, the cut-off SAA concentrations at each probability were 2.9 mg/L (p = 0.05), 5.7 mg/L (p = 0.1), 13.7 mg/L (p = 0.5), and 21.8 mg/L (p = 0.9), respectively, and 6.5 mg/L (p = 0.122) based on evaluation performed using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results indicated that, with the practical application of the obtained cut-off value, the measurement of SAA concentrations for JB breeding cows with LATIA could be potentially beneficial in the early evaluation of inflammatory diseases in JB breeding cows and possibly useful in the prevention of not only metabolic diseases but also non-nutritional diseases during the perinatal period of JB breeding cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622727</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Bee Stressors from an Immunological Perspective and Strategies to Improve Bee Health.</Title>	<Abstract>Honeybees are the most prevalent insect pollinator species; they pollinate a wide range of crops. Colony collapse disorder (CCD), which is caused by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors, incurs high economic/ecological loss. Despite extensive research to identify and study the various ecological stressors such as microbial infections, exposure to pesticides, loss of habitat, and improper beekeeping practices that are claimed to cause these declines, the deep understanding of the observed losses of these important insects is still missing. Honeybees have an innate immune system, which includes physical barriers and cellular and humeral responses to defend against pathogens and parasites. Exposure to various stressors may affect this system and the health of individual bees and colonies. This review summarizes and discusses the composition of the honeybee immune system and the consequences of exposure to stressors, individually or in combinations, on honeybee immune competence. In addition, we discuss the relationship between bee nutrition and immunity. Nutrition and phytochemicals were highlighted as the factors with a high impact on honeybee immunity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several studies have demonstrated its properties, including antimicrobial features. As a result of the restricted availability of human amniotic membrane for veterinary use, canine amniotic membrane has become an attractive alternative. Clinical studies of the application of canine amniotic membrane in animals and the understanding of its biological properties are limited. This study aimed to determine the expression of peptide genes of natural antimicrobials in canine amniotic membrane. Expressions of canine &#946;-defensin 1, 102, and 103, and canine Elafin were determined in healthy puppies by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Canine &#946;-defensin 1, 103, and Elafin were expressed in all samples, possibly suggesting a role in the innate immune system of normal canine amniotic membrane. Further investigations of protein expression and localization are recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight male dogs were exposed to MPs (1962-1966 MHz; specific absorption rate 0.96 W/kg) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week, for 10 weeks. Holter monitoring for HRV analysis was performed at baseline (BL) and every 2 weeks, until the end of the study. Electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure (BP), echocardiography, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), hematology and biochemistry profiles, body surface temperature, and semen quality were evaluated at BL, week 5, and week 10 during exposure. The results showed that most of the HRV parameters did not significantly differ among timepoints, except for the mean of an interval between continuous normal R waves in week 6 that was higher than that at BL (p = 0.022). The RR and QT intervals from ECG in week 5 were prolonged, compared to the BL values (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), but those parameters were within the normal limits. The echocardiography, BP, cTnI concentrations, body surface temperature, and semen quality results were not different from BL values. In conclusion, this study found no evidence suggesting an adverse effect of cell phone exposure on HRV, cardiac function, blood profiles, body surface temperature, or semen quality in healthy dogs, when exposed for 10 weeks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622730</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>&#932;he Effect of Opioid Administration on Cytologic and Histopathologic Diagnosis of Canine Cutaneous Mast Cell Tumors Treated by Surgical Excision.</Title>	<Abstract>Mast cell tumor (MCT) is a frequent cutaneous tumor in dogs, with a variable biological behavior. Studies correlate cytologic and histopathologic features of MCTs with their biological behavior, prognosis, and response to treatment. The use of preoperative opioids is common in canine patients undergoing surgical removal of these tumors. Certain opioids can induce or downregulate mast cell degranulation and influence cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the administration of morphine or butorphanol during surgical excision of canine cutaneous MCTs affects their cytologic and histopathologic appearance, thus influencing cytologic and histopathologic grading. This was a prospective, blinded, randomized, cohort clinical study. Forty-five dogs with cutaneous MCTs were randomly allocated into three groups according to preanaesthetic medication: dexmedetomidine combined with morphine (group M) or butorphanol (group B) or normal saline (group C). Cytologic specimens and histopathologic samples were obtained both prior to and after surgery. Samples were graded according to Kiupel's and Patnaik's systems, examined immunohistochemically for Ki-67 protein (Ki-67) and c-kit proto-oncogene product (KIT) expression, and histochemically for argyrophilic nucleolar organizing regions (AgNORs). Based on both Kiupel's and Patnaik's systems, no statistically significant differences were noted concerning the number of cases with grading discrepancies in grades allocated prior to versus after surgery among the groups. The same applied for cytological grading and immunohistochemical and histochemical evaluation. It seems that administration of morphine or butorphanol as part of the preanesthetic medication for surgical removal of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors does not influence histopathologic and cytologic grading of MCTs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we characterized the dosage levels of various innate immune stimulants, including unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine dinucleotide -containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), cyclic polyphosphazene 75B (CPZ75B), avian beta-defensin 2 (ABD2), and combinations of these reagents given in ovo. Data derived from a series of animal experiments demonstrated that the in ovo administration of 10-50 &#181;g CpG ODN/embryo (on embryonic day 18) is an effective formulation for control of yolk sac infection (YSI) due to avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in young chicks. Amongst the different combinations of innate immune stimulants, the in ovo administration of CpG ODN 10 &#181;g in combination with 15 &#181;g of poly I:C was the most effective combination, offering 100% protection from YSI. It is expected that the introduction of these reagents to management practices at the hatchery level may serve as a potential replacement for antibiotics for the reduction of early chick mortality (ECM) due to YSI/colibacillosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622732</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Evaluation of Canine Nerve Sheath Tumors and Proposal for an Updated Classification.</Title>	<Abstract>Nerve sheath tumors are a group of tumors originating from Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and perineurial cells. In veterinary pathology, the terminology for nerve sheath tumors remains inconsistent, and many pathologists follow the human classification of such tumors in practice. Immunohistochemistry plays an important role in the diagnosis of nerve sheath tumors, but specific immunohistochemical and molecular biomarkers are lacking. In our study, we histopathologically reevaluated 79 canine nerve sheath tumors and assessed their reactivity for the immunohistochemical markers Sox10, claudin-1, GFAP, CNPase, and Ki-67. Based on the results, we classified the tumors according to the most recent human classification. Twelve cases were diagnosed as benign nerve sheath tumors, including six neurofibromas, three nerve sheath myxomas, two hybrid nerve sheath tumors (perineurioma/neurofibroma and perineurioma/schwannoma), and one schwannoma. Sixty-seven tumors were malignant nerve sheath tumors, including fifty-six conventional, four perineural, one epithelioid malignant nerve sheath tumor, and six malignant nerve sheath tumors with divergent differentiation. We believe that with the application of the proposed panel, an updated classification of canine nerve sheath tumors could largely follow the recent human WHO classification of tumors of the cranial and paraspinal nerves, but prospective studies would be needed to assess its prognostic value.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622733</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>CircRNA Expression Profiles in Canine Mammary Tumours.</Title>	<Abstract>Numerous studies have shown that the occurrence and development of tumours are associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the expression profile and clinical significance of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours remain unclear. In this paper, we collected tissue samples from three dogs with canine mammary tumours and analysed the expression profiles of circRNAs in these samples using high-throughput sequencing technology. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses revealed 14 biological processes associated with these genes, and 11 of these genes were selected for qRT-PCR to verify their authenticity. CircRNAs have sponge adsorption to miRNAs, so we constructed a circRNA-miRNA network map using Cytoscape software. As a result, we identified a total of 14,851 circRNAs in canine mammary tumours and its adjacent normal tissues. Of these, 106 were differentially expressed (fold change &#8805; 2, p &#8804; 0.05), and 64 were upregulated and 42 were downregulated. The GO analysis revealed that the biological processes involved were mainly in the regulation of the secretory pathway, the regulation of neurotransmitter secretion and the positive regulation of phagocytosis. Most of these biological pathways were associated with the cGMP-PKG (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signalling pathway, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signalling pathway and the oxytocin signalling pathway. After screening, source genes closely associated with canine mammary tumours were found to include RYR2, PDE4D, ROCK2, CREB3L2 and UBA3, and associated circRNAs included chr27:26618544-26687235-, chr26:8194880-8201833+ and chr17:7960861-7967766-. In conclusion, we reveals the expression profile of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours. In addition, some circRNAs might be used as potential biomarkers for molecular diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622734</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Altered Intestinal Production of Volatile Fatty Acids in Dogs Triggered by Lactulose and Psyllium Treatment.</Title>	<Abstract>The intestinal microbiome of dogs can be influenced by a number of factors such as non-starch polysaccharides as well as some non-digestible oligo- and disaccharides. These molecules are only decomposed by intestinal anaerobic microbial fermentation, resulting in the formation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which play a central role in maintaining the balance of the intestinal flora and affecting the health status of the host organism. In the present study, the effects of lactulose and psyllium husk (Plantago ovata) were investigated regarding their influence on concentrations of various VFAs produced by the canine intestinal microbiome. Thirty dogs were kept on a standard diet for 15 days, during which time half of the animals received oral lactulose once a day, while the other group was given a psyllium-supplemented diet (in 0.67 and in 0.2 g/kg body weight concentrations, respectively). On days 0, 5, 10 and 15 of the experiment, feces were sampled from the rectum, and the concentration of each VFA was determined by GC-MS (gas chromatography&#8722;mass spectrometry). Lactulose administration caused a significant increase in the total VFA concentration of the feces on days 10 and 15 of the experiment (p = 0.035 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively); however, in the case of psyllium supplementation, the concentration of VFAs showed a significant elevation only on day 15 (p = 0.003). Concentrations of acetate and propionate increased significantly on days 5, 10 and 15 after lactulose treatment (p = 0.044, p = 0.048 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Following psyllium administration, intestinal acetate, propionate and n-butyrate production were stimulated on day 15, as indicated by the fecal VFA levels (p = 0.002, p = 0.035 and p = 0.02, respectively). It can be concluded that both lactulose and psyllium are suitable for enhancing the synthesis of VFAs in the intestines of dogs. Increased acetate and propionate concentrations were observed following the administration of both supplements; however, elevated n-butyrate production was found only after psyllium treatment, suggesting that the applied prebiotics may exert slightly different effects in the hindgut of dogs. These findings can be also of great importance regarding the treatment and management of patients suffering from intestinal disorders as well as hepatic encephalopathy due to portosystemic shunt.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Seeds on the Growth Performance, Hematological Parameters, and Intestinal Histomorphology of Broiler Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of fenugreek seeds (FS) as a potential alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in broiler chickens. In the first experiment, one-day-old Ross (n = 160) straight-run broilers were fed FS at 0 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g/kg of diet during the starter (from 1 to 21 days) and finisher phase (from 22 to 35 days) with four replicates of ten birds each. In the second experiment, one-day-old Ross (n = 144) male broilers were fed 0 g, 5 g, and 10 g FS per kilogram of diet during the starter (from 1 to 21 days) and finisher phase (from 22 to 42 days) with six replicates of eight birds each. In addition to growth performance, hematological parameters and intestinal histomorphology were measured in the second experiment. FS linearly reduced the body weight gain (BWG) (p &lt; 0.001), feed intake (FI) (p &lt; 0.05), and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) (p &lt; 0.05) during the starter phase in both experiments. However, no significant effects on BWG, FI, and FCR were observed during the finisher phase. Moreover, the overall BWG and FI were linearly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) with the increasing levels of FS, but BWG and FI were similar in the 5 g/kg FS group and control group. The inclusion of FS had a linear increase in white blood cell (WBC), heterophil, and lymphocyte count (p &lt; 0.005) and the decrease in hematocrit % (p = 0.004) and total bilirubin (p = 0.001). The villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio of jejunum and ileum were significantly lower in 5 g FS and 10 g FS treatments (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the control. The result indicates that the dietary inclusion of FS reduces the early growth performance, increases the WBC counts, and negatively affects the intestinal morphology of broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, this issue is underpinned by the One Health perspective, due to the ability of AMR to be transmitted between animals and humans living in the same environment. Therefore, since 2014 different surveillance and control programmes have been established to control AMR in commensal and zoonotic bacteria in production animals. However, public health authorities' reports on AMR leave out companion animals, due to the lack of national programmes and data collection by countries. This missing information constitutes a serious public health concern due to the close contact between companion animals, humans and their surrounding environment. This absence of control and harmonisation between programmes in European countries leads to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics against common diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to establish adequate surveillance and monitoring programmes for AMR in companion animals and further develop alternatives to antibiotic use in this sector, considering the impact this could have on the gut microbiota. In this context, the aim of this review is to evaluate the current control and epidemiological situations of AMR in companion animals in the European Union (EU), as well as the proposed alternatives to antibiotics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several studies disclosed some similarities between the two species, including the constitutive activation of the NF-&#954;B pathway as a fundamental underlying pathogenetic mechanism. In humans, the downregulation of IL-1R8 is implicated in DLBCL development, but its role in dogs has not been explored so far. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of this tumor in dogs, we evaluated the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1R8 in 12 control lymph nodes obtained from dogs not bearing tumors and from 50 dogs with DLBCL. Moreover, we analyzed through qRT-PCR the expression of TLR7, TLR9, MYC, and p52 genes that are known to be involved in the IL-1R8 regulatory network. IL-1R8 and p52 were downregulated in DLBCLs compared to control lymph nodes (p &lt; 0.001), while a higher expression of TLR7, TLR9, and MYC was observed in DLBCLs (p &lt; 0.01). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the gene expression results, revealing a significantly lower IL-1R8 staining score in DLBCLs compared to control lymph nodes (p &lt; 0.0001). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-1R8 downregulation may represent one of the mechanisms driving DLBCL pathogenesis in dogs, mainly through the dysregulation of the Toll-like/interleukin receptors signaling cascade and the aberrant activation of the classical NF-&#954;B pathway.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to use in silico analysis to identify genes that might be epigenetically modulated in cells treated with crocodile serum and to understand the role of potential genes as novel candidates with epigenetic therapeutic potential. The findings report five proto-oncogenes (TUBA1B, SLC2A1, PGK1, CCND1, and NCAPD2) and two tumor suppressor genes (RPLP2, RPL37) as novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive overview of relevant studies on epigenetic regulation of these genes along with an insight into their clinical implications. Therefore, elucidating the molecules present in the serum and gut bacteria of reptiles such as crocodiles may offer insights into the role of these genes on longevity, health, disease, and life expectancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) invades swine via mucosal tissue. To enhance the mucosal immune response to PEDV, we modified B. subtilis to express a PEDV antigen and used it as a mucosal vaccine delivery system. Initially, we constructed a recombinant B. subtilis strain (B.s-RCL) that expressed the PEDV spike protein and L-Lectin-&#946;-GF, with the goal of inducing mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and anti-PEDV serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) production, as well as to increase the number of microfold cells (M cells). Following the oral administration of B.s-RCL to mice, the small intestinal PEDV-specific sIgA expression levels significantly increased, as well as the increased number of B.s-RCL adhered to M cells. Moreover, we found that mice administered B.s-RCL exhibited markedly higher percentages of CD4[+] and CD8[+] T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen compared to the control mice. Furthermore, we found that intestinal mucosa sIgA and serum anti-PEDV IgG levels were higher in mice orally immunised with B.s-RCL, suggesting that the mice could be more resistant to PEDV. In this study, we developed a novel oral vaccine to prevent porcine diarrhoea epidemics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Intranasal (IN) route of drug administration is easier, and free of risks such as pain and tissue damage compared with intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes in bird species, including wild birds. Although previous studies have demonstrated the use of IN route for producing sedation, no studies are available on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IN drugs in birds. This study analyzed the pharmacokinetics and sedative-analgesic efficacy of intranasal butorphanol (2 mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (80 &#181;g/kg) and their combination (butorphanol, 2 mg/kg; DXM, 80 &#181;g/kg) in healthy, male, Ross broiler chickens (n = 6/group) aged between 6 and 8 weeks. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax, p = 0.01), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 120 min (AUC0 to 120, p = 0.02) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss, p = 0.02) of DXM were significantly higher than that of DXM co-administered with butorphanol. The mechanical nociceptive thresholds and the sedation scores of DXM group were significantly higher than the baseline value. Dexmedetomidine (80 &#181;g/kg, IN) was effective in chickens, and the drug absorption was more rapid than that of DXM with butorphanol. However, the duration of action of DXM was short. Lower value of Cmax and nociceptive thresholds showed the nonsignificant efficacy of butorphanol at a dose of 2 mg/kg after IN administration in broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study we set up PCR-based assays to detect the presence of DNA traces left in the honey by two damaging honey bee pests: the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella). DNA was extracted from 82 honey samples produced in Italy and amplified using two specific primer pairs that target the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) of A. tumida and two specific primer pairs that target the same gene in G. mellonella. The limit of detection was tested using sequential dilutions of the pest DNA. Only one honey sample produced in Calabria was positive for A. tumida whereas about 66% of all samples were positively amplified for G. mellonella. The use of honey eDNA could be important to establish early and effective measures to contain at the local (e.g., apiary) or regional scales these two damaging pests and, particularly for the small hive beetle, to prevent its widespread diffusion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Population immunity may be an important driver of seasonal subtype predominance in waterfowl populations and may affect the potential for establishment of introduced IAV such as the Eurasian-like A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage in these populations. Here, we examine the prevalence of naturally acquired antibodies to nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (H3, H4, H5), and neuraminidase (N1, N2, N6, N8) in early migrating mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled in Northwest Minnesota during staging and early fall migration in September 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018. Serologic results were compared to historic and contemporary virus isolation results from these same study sites. The prevalence of antibodies to NP ranged from 60.8&#8722;76.1% in hatch-year (HY) birds and from 86.0&#8722;92.7% in after-hatch-year (AHY, &gt;1-year-old) mallards indicating a high level of previous infection with IAV early in the fall migration season. Neutralizing antibodies were detected against H3, H4, and H5 in all years as were antibodies to N1, N2, N6, and N8. A high proportion of NP seropositive ducks tested positive for antibodies to multiple HA and NA subtypes, and this was more common in the AHY age class. Antibody prevalence to the HA and NA subtypes included in this study were consistent with the predominance of H4N6 in these populations during all years and reflected a broadening of the antibody response with age. Additional work is needed to document the longevity of these immune responses, if and how they correlate with protection against IAV transmission, infection, and disease, and if, as detected in this study, they adequately describe the true extent of exposure to IAV or specific HA or NA subtypes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Because of this, the industry has developed plans to ensure business continuity during a FAD outbreak. A core aspect of these plans is regional standstill orders of swine movements to prevent disease spread following a FAD introduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information about the impact of such practices on animal movements throughout the remaining swine marketing channel. This study utilizes a simplified gravity model, to understand the effects of standstill orders on individual states. The effect of each closure on the established trade patterns is determined by monitoring changes in a PPML regression coefficients of the model. Model validation compared the predicted impact of the closure of a terminal processing facility against a real-life closure dataset collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The analysis determined that both the population size and location of the closure affected the observed trade patterns. These findings suggest that using a regional stop movement order may complicate disease introduction preparation as each policy comes with its own potential outcome, shifting the geospatial distribution of area risk posed by these cull populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The mean &#177; SEM values of the main PK values were 1.84 &#177; 0.31 &#956;g/mL for peak plasma concentration, 1.5 &#177; 0.24 h for time to maximum plasma concentration, 11.43 &#177; 2.04 h&#183;&#181;g/mL for area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, 3.55 &#177; 0.65 h for elimination half-life, and 5.37 &#177; 0.94 h for mean residency time. No adverse reactions were detected. The relatively high plasma concentration and short time to maximum plasma concentration suggest that meloxicam could turn into an efficient analgesic and anti-inflammatory candidate drug to be used in skates. Further efficacy, pharmacodynamic, and multiple-dose studies with meloxicam are needed in elasmobranchs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a form of restricted eating aimed at reducing weight in obese subjects. The present study aims to investigate changes in vascular endothelial function, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and protein kinase B (Akt) protein expressions with TRF in obese and normal rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into two normal and three obese groups; obesity was induced in the obese groups by feeding with a high-fat diet (HFD) for six weeks. After six weeks, rats were equally divided into five groups (n = 7 per group): Normal group (NR) which continued on a standard diet for six more weeks, normal group switched to TRF with a standard diet for six weeks (NR + TRFSD), obese group (OR) which continued on HFD for six more weeks, obese group switched to TRF of HFD (OR + TRFHFD), and obese group switched to TRF of a standard diet (OR + TRFSD). TRF was practiced for six weeks, after which the rats were sacrificed. Aortic endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations and contractions were assessed using the organ bath. Aortic eNOS and Akt protein expressions were determined using immunoblotting. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, body mass index (BMI), serum lipid profile, Lee's index, serum insulin levels, and sensitivity (HOMA-IR) were also measured. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly impaired, while endothelium-dependent contraction increased in obese rats compared to that in normal rats. Both obese groups which underwent TRF with a HFD and standard diet improved their impairments in endothelium-dependent relaxation and reduced endothelium-dependent contraction; these were associated with increased expressions of aortic eNOS and Akt protein. Both obese groups with TRF reduced body weight, BMI, Lee's index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and improved insulin sensitivity. TRF improved endothelium-dependent relaxation and reduced endothelium-dependent contraction, thus attenuating endothelial dysfunction in obese rats. These were associated with increased aortic eNOS and Akt protein expressions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Of the three animals examined by CT, right-sided and left-sided involvements of this disease could be diagnosed in two animals and one animal, respectively, as represented by the accumulations of hyperattenuating contents within the extended tympanic bulla. These cases were treated with a ventral bulla osteotomy, which was conducted between the sternothyroid muscle and the omohyoid muscle via an incision made caudally to the area of the thyroid cartilage. The postoperative outcome was satisfactory in one case. However, the remaining two cases showed unsatisfactory outcomes; one calf died on the 10th postoperative day, as it was already seriously ill. The other animal died suddenly during surgery, potentially due to stimulation of the vagus nerve. The use of CT could allow effective visualization of unilateral lesions, proving helpful for the recommendation of surgical intervention. Based on the unfavorable results in two cases, we note that to prevent surgical complications, the clinical applicability of CT such as the creation of severity criteria and development of imaging-assist procedure should be advanced.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

AFK was lower on intensive (490.2 &#177; 0.9 days; n = 13,345) than on extensive farms (511.7 &#177; 2.5 days; n = 2357; p &lt; 0.001), and highest during the spring season (533.9 &#177; 2.7 days; n = 1932; p &lt; 0.001) in both production systems. The average KI was 355.7 &#177; 0.4 days, mainly varying according to dry period, kidding season and lactation number and kidding type (p &lt; 0.01). A significant interaction between production system, kidding season and dry period was observed with the highest AFK on intensive farms during spring and summer for goats presenting a dry period of up to six months. The overall prolificacy (1.64 &#177; 0.01) increased in recent years in both systems, and it was affected by the production system, but with different patterns; so, the highest prolificacy of primiparous and multiparous goats was observed on extensive and intensive farms, respectively. Besides that, the prolificacy and other reproductive parameters, such as AFK, significantly increased in the last decade, which could be related to management improvements. Besides that, the existence of inter-annual variations should be considered to compare data between farms and years, and to establish the farms&#8217; objectives according to their production systems and production goals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two experimental total mixed rations (TMR) were prepared: (1) a TMR meeting the requirement of fattening beef having an average daily gain (ADG) 0.8 kg/day (CON) and (2) a TMR that included 2% RGB on a dry matter (DM) basis (GINSENG). In vitro rumen fermentation and in vivo growth experiments were conducted using two experimental diets. A total of 22 Hanwoo steers were distributed to two treatments (CON vs. GINSENG) in a completely randomized block design according to body weight (BW). The experiment was conducted during the summer season for five weeks. The final BW, ADG, DM intake, and feed conversion ratio did not differ between treatments in the growth trial. In the mRNA expression results, only HSP 90 showed an increasing tendency in the GINSENG group. The use of 2%DM RGB did not improve the growth performance or alleviate heat stress in fattening Hanwoo steers during the summer season.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The beehive is vulnerable to infections due to arthropods, fungi, protozoa, bacteria and/or viruses that manage to by-pass the individual and social immune mechanisms of bees. Due to the close proximity of bees in the beehive and their foraging habits, infections easily spread within and between beehives. Moreover, international trade of bees has caused the global spread of infections, several of which result in significant losses for apiculture. Only in a few cases can infections be diagnosed with the naked eye, by direct observation of the pathogen in the case of some arthropods, or by pathogen-associated distinctive traits. Development of molecular methods based on the amplification and analysis of one or more genes or genomic segments has brought significant progress to the study of bee pathogens, allowing for: (i) the precise and sensitive identification of the infectious agent; (ii) the analysis of co-infections; (iii) the description of novel species; (iv) associations between geno- and pheno-types and (v) population structure studies. Sequencing of bee pathogen genomes has allowed for the identification of new molecular targets and the development of specific genotypification strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622750</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>ASIP Promoter Variants Predict the Sesame Coat Color in Shiba Inu Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Animals exhibit a wide variety of genetically determined coat colors and pigmentation patterns that serve important roles in adaptation and communication. Although the genetics of the main coat colors in dogs have been studied extensively, there are types of coat pigmentation that have not been explained yet. Recently, an association between the variants in the ASIP gene Ventral (VP) and Hair Cycle (HCP) promoters with different coat colors in dogs has been established. Here, we used the new findings as a basis to investigate the genetics of the red sesame coat color in Shiba Inu dogs. Our study revealed that red sesame dogs carry a specific heterozygous ASIP promoter diplotype, VP2-HCP1/VP2-HCP3, where VP2-HCP1 is responsible for the red coat with a dark overlay, and VP2-HCP3 for a tan point-like pattern. This finding explains the inheritance of this coat color pattern and can be used by breeders to produce dogs with this rare phenotype. A comparison of sesame dogs (VP2-HCP1/VP2-HCP3) to a dog homozygous for the VP2-HCP1 promoter haplotype suggests that the incomplete dominance between the ASIP alleles may be involved in the sesame coat formation. These results are in good agreement with the new model explaining how different levels of ASIP gene expression affect the regulation of pigment synthesis in melanocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Electrocardiography revealed normal heart rate of 100 bpm, evidence of sinus respiratory arrhythmia (SRA) and frequent second degree atrio-ventricular block following peak inspiratory phase suggestive of vagally-induced atrio-ventricular conduction delay. Echocardiographic examination showed mild mitral regurgitation without any other cardiac changes, and systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) blood pressure values were 185/90 mmHg (SAP/DAP). Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was increased to 7.3 ng/mL, suggesting a myocardial injury. A Holter examination revealed evidence of overall decrease in heart rate variability with evidence of sympathetic overdrive on time and frequency domain as well as when the non-linear Poincar&#233; plot was analyzed. Based on the author's knowledge, this is the first report of a second degree atrio-ventricular block associated with vagal activity in a dog, with evidence of sympathetic overdrive and severe azotemia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622752</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>ProAKAP4 Semen Concentrations as a Valuable Marker Protein of Post-Thawed Semen Quality and Bull Fertility: A Retrospective Study.</Title>	<Abstract>Functional sperm quality markers to predict bull fertility have been actively investigated. Among them, proAKAP4, which is the precursor of AKAP4, the main structural protein in the fibrous sheath of spermatozoa; appears to be promising, especially since spermatozoa lacking AKAP4 expression were shown to be immotile, abnormal, and infertile. In this study, the objective was to evaluate proAKAP4 concentration values with the classic sperm motility descriptors and fertility outcomes (NRR at 90 days) in post-thawed conditions of 10 bulls' semen. ProAKAP4 expression was confirmed by Western blotting and proAKAP4 concentrations were determined by ELISA. Variations in proAKAP4 concentrations were observed independently of the motility sperm descriptors measured using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). A ProAKAP4 concentration of 38.67 &#177; 8.55 ng/10 million spermatozoa was obtained as a statistical mean of all samples. Threshold values of proAKAP4 were then determined between 19.96 to 96.95 ng/10 million spermatozoa. ProAKAP4 concentrations were positively correlated with progressive motility and the linearity coefficient. The sperm showing the lowest progressive motility were the samples exhibiting proAKAP4 concentrations below 20 ng/10 million spermatozoa. Furthermore, proAKAP4 concentrations were significantly higher in bulls with a higher NRR in the field. Our results demonstrate a correlation between the semen concentration of proAKAP4 and NRR-90d (p = 0.05) in post-thawed bull semen, highlighting the potential of proAKAP4 as a predictive marker of bull fertility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the possible relations between microbiological counts, as well as endotoxin levels and disease symptoms. Data from microbiological examination reports were analyzed retrospectively, including the results of sensory examination, microbiological counts, and lipopolysaccharide contents. Sensory analysis gave an indication of deficiencies in microbiological analysis, but both methods did not give consistently equivalent results regarding the hygienic status of forage. The strongest agreements between sensory and microbiological findings were demonstrated in haylage regarding mold contamination. The influences of dry matter content on microbiological quality could be shown in haylage and hay, whereas this did not apply to straw. Deviations regarding molds and the detection of Aspergillus species occurred, especially in haylage, with values above 70% DM detected (39.6%, p=0.0021 and 47.2%, p = 0.0393). Aspergillus was detected more frequently, and average counts were higher in samples that were suspected to induce coughing in horses (p = 0.0118 and p = 0.0313, respectively). The results of the present study emphasize the importance of feed hygiene for equine respiratory health and the need for the microbiological examination of feedstuffs, since sensory analysis cannot provide an error-free prediction of microbial counts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At the same time, several studies showed that this neurotrophin can also play a role in non-neuronal tissues (e.g., among gonads). In spite of a large number of studies present in mammals, investigations devoted to NGF and its receptor TrkA in the reproductive system of other animal models, such as teleost fish, are scarce. To increase our knowledge of NGF and its receptor in a vertebrate gonads model, the present report describes the expression patterns of ngf and trka mRNA in the testis and ovary of adult zebrafish. By using chromogenic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that in the testis of adult zebrafish, ngf and its receptor trka are mainly expressed in spermatogony B and spermatocytes. In the ovary of this fish, ngf and trka are expressed at different stages of oocyte development. Altogether, these results show that this neurotrophin and its receptor have an important role in the reproductive system that is conserved during vertebrate evolution.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Topical formulations of cAM could deliver the beneficial properties of cAM without the need for surgical intervention. The present study aimed to investigate biological compositions of cAM and its extracts, including their corneal wound healing efficacy. In this study, canine amniotic membrane extract (cAME) and lyophilized canine amniotic membrane extract (cAMX) were developed. Bioactive molecules related to corneal wound healing, including hepatocyte growth factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, Thrombospondin-1 and Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist were studied at both gene and protein expression levels. Cell viability and wound healing assays were investigated for the possibility of cAME and cAMX as topical applications. The results demonstrated that all of the relevant genes and proteins were detected in cAM, cAME and cAMX. Both cAME and cAMX showed wound healing properties in vitro and cAME at 1.0 mg/mL concentration appeared to have the best healing efficacy. In conclusion, cAME and cAMX generated for topical use provided promising results in the healing of corneal defects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cats are a natural reservoir for many of these species. Accordingly, living in close and intimate contact with animals has been identified as a risk factor, and an important zoonotic significance has therefore been attributed to NHPH. To determine the prevalence and associated gastric histopathological changes of Helicobacter species, the gastric mucosa of 71 cats were evaluated. Only four presented normal histopathological mucosa with the absence of spiral-shaped organisms. Normal gastric mucosa and the presence of spiral-shaped bacteria were observed in 13 cats. The remaining animals presented histopathological changes representative of gastritis. Helicobacter species were detected in 53 cats (74.6%) by at least one detection method. None of the animals were positive for H. pylori or for H. ailurogastricus. Helicobacter heilmannii organisms were identified in 20 animals, predominantly in the body gastric region. Helicobacter salomonis was the second most prevalent species (57.1%), although it was mainly found in association with other NHPH. Helicobacter felis and H. bizzozeronii were less frequently detected. The great majority of the Helicobacter spp. PCR-positive animals presented normal features regarding fibrosis/mucosal atrophy, neutrophils, eosinophils, or other inflammatory cells and lymphofollicular hyperplasia. Given the controversy and the strong evidence of absence of significant histopathological alterations associated with the presence of Helicobacter spp. in cats, it is possible to hypothesize that these bacteria may be able to adapt to the feline gastric microenvironment or even to comprise part of the gastric microbiome of this animal species. Thus, prudency must be taken when prescribing an antibiotic therapy based solely on the presence of these bacteria in the feline stomach.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed to evaluate the clinical, hematological, and biochemical alterations and the oxidative stress generated by acute blood loss. Eighteen healthy sheep underwent phlebotomy to remove 40% of the blood volume and were evaluated clinically and by laboratory tests for clinical, biochemical, and blood gas variables and to assess oxidative stress before induction (T0), 30 min (T30 min), and 6 (T6 h), 12 (T12 h), and 24 h (T24 h) after blood loss. The sheep showed tachycardia from T30 min until T24 h, reduction in the hematocrit, number of erythrocytes, and hemoglobin concentration, with lower values at T24 h and increase in the number of leukocytes from T12 h on. There was a reduction in blood pH and oxygen pressure at T30 min, increased lactate concentration and reduced blood bicarbonate at this time. There was an increase in urea concentration from T6 h until the end of the study, with no change in creatinine levels. The animals did not show changes in the concentration of malonaldehyde, and in the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, but there was a reduction in the concentration of reduced glutathione at T24 h. The acute loss of 40% of blood volume is capable of promoting relevant clinical, hematological, blood gas, and biochemical alterations, and contributed to the appearance of oxidative stress with reduced glutathione concentration, suggesting that this process generated free radicals in sufficient quantity to diminish the action of antioxidants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In consideration of animal welfare, we developed an oral endoscopic biopsy procedure to allow the obtaining of rumen epithelial samples, thus serving as an alternative for measuring the height and width of rumen papillae in calves in a safe, quick, and efficient manner that allows the slaughtering of calves to be avoided. This procedure was tested on 12 Brangus crossbred calves randomly distributed in two groups, with one fed a meal starter and the other an extruded starter feed. Calves underwent a 12-h fasting period, were restrained in a squeeze chute, administered a dose of atropine, and sedated with xylazine before the oral endoscopic biopsy procedure. A 120 cm long Olympus[&#174;] oral flexible video endoscope and forceps were used to collect cranial-dorsal sac rumen epithelial tissue samples of approximately 0.5 mm. Endoscopy was successful in all 12 calves and the collected tissue samples were placed in formalin (10%) for further processing for obtaining rumen papillae measurements. Consumption of the extruded starter feed resulted in the increased (p = 0.035) width of rumen papillae. The oral endoscopic biopsy procedure implemented in this study was demonstrated to be successful and is thus an alternative technique for studying rumen epithelial development and morphometric alterations in calf rumen tissue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study evaluated retrospective VetCompass veterinary clinical records to explore geographical variability and ambient conditions associated with HRI events in UK dogs, and report the intrinsic (canine) and extrinsic (location, trigger, ambient weather) risk factors for severe disease and fatal outcome in dogs affected by HRI. Dogs living in London had the greatest odds for developing HRI compared with dogs living in the North West (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.31-2.74). The median ambient temperature on days of HRI events was 16.9 &#176;C. For dogs with HRI, age, bodyweight and trigger were risk factors associated with severe disease. Age, skull shape and clinical grade of HRI presentation were associated with a fatal outcome. Whilst the majority of HRI events overall were triggered by exertion, the risk of severe disease was greater in situations where dogs could not escape the heat source (vehicular confinement), and the risk of death in HRI cases was greater for those dogs with reduced capacity to thermoregulate (older and brachycephalic dogs). These results highlight the need for better owner awareness of the factors that increase the risk of severe and fatal HRI, as a first stage in protecting canine welfare in the face of rising global temperatures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its infections are associated with the accidental ingestion of contaminated soil and affecting, especially children. In this study, feces, and soil samples from 14 public parks in the city of Valencia were analyzed. The Telemann method and a modified version of a sieving technique were used to process feces and soil, respectively. None of the fecal samples and 10.9% of soil samples from five parks (35.7%) tested positive for the presence of Toxocara eggs. The most contaminated areas were the canine sanitary parks (30.8% of the samples), followed by socialization areas for dogs (9.7%); no positive samples were found at children's playgrounds. Our results suggest that most pets in Valencia are periodically dewormed, although additional preventive measures should be applied, since the risk of infection exists probably due to the presence of stray dogs and feral cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the influence of sucrose supplementation into maternal diets has not been examined in pigs. We tested the hypothesis that sucrose inclusion into sows&#8217; diets would modify the feeding behavior of post-weaning pigs for sweet and umami solutions. Twenty-two sows (85 days of gestation) were used. They randomly received a gestational and lactating diet with or without 50 g/kg of sucrose. Different sucrose and monosodium glutamate solutions were offered to the progeny to analyze different intake behavior measurements during nursery. Pigs born from treated sows presented a higher sucrose threshold than control animals (15 mM vs. 0.1 mM, p = 0.032) and displayed decreased sensory-motivated intake for this disaccharide (p &lt; 0.023). Sucrose consumption decreased (p &lt; 0.021) in pigs born from treated sows, as well as the consumption patterns for the less concentrated solutions (p &lt; 0.014). The inclusion of sucrose into maternal diets (gestation and lactation) could modified pigs&#8217; feeding behavior after weaning when offered sweet solutions, which speaks against the practicality of this supplementation in pig production systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report describes the retroperitoneal metastasis of primary cutaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma. An 8-year-old, spayed female beagle dog, weighing 11.7 kg, presented with a history of anorexia, hypodynamia, and weight loss. Clinical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography revealed a skin mass on the dorsum of the right metatarsal region, an enlarged ipsilateral popliteal lymph node, and a retroperitoneal mass. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the popliteal lymph node suggested metastasis of an apocrine sweat gland tumor. Surgical excision of the skin mass, popliteal lymph node, and retroperitoneal mass was performed. The retroperitoneal mass was diagnosed as a metastasis of primary cutaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 but negative for cytokeratin 20 and S100 proteins. There were no postoperative complications, except for temporary hindlimb edema, including local recurrence or metastasis, in the 6-month postoperative follow-up period. This case illustrates that although malignant apocrine gland tumors are rare in dogs, a wide resection of primary cutaneous apocrine gland adenocarcinomas is recommended because of the risk of local invasion or distant metastasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hence, lowering it is crucial to increasing producer profitability. The microbial community in rumen is vital for nutritional digestion and absorption in ruminants. Live yeast and yeast-based products generated from the strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commercial strain) are actively being used and investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of substituting soybean meal (SBM) in concentrate diets with yeast-fermented palm kernel cake protein (YFPKCP) on dry matter intake, digestibility, blood markers, and nitrogen balance. Five crossbred Thai Native-Anglo-Nubian goats (50% Thai Native goats with 50% Anglo-Nubian goats) weighing an average of 27 &#177; 2 kg were randomly allocated to one of five diets using a 5 &#215; 5 Latin square design: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% YFPKCP replacement for SBM. Plicatulum hay (Paspalum plicatulum Michx.) was provided ad libitum. There were no significant differences in dry matter (DM) intake among treatments, but the apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were affected (p &lt; 0.05) by including YFPKCP in diets. They also tended to be slightly lower for goats fed the diet containing 100% YFPKCP replacement for SBM compared to other treatments. Ruminal pH, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), blood glucose, and packed cell volume were equivalent among treatments. On the other hand, replacement YFPKCP reduced digestibility and N absorption by up to 75% (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there was no difference in total volatile fatty-acid concentration among goats fed YFPKCP as a substitute for SBM. According to the results of this study, the level of YFPKCP in the concentrate replacement of SBM for goats fed plicatulum hay should be 75%.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The use of a beneficial bacteria-based strategy for the prevention and biocontrol of American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB) diseases in honey bees offers interesting prospects. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of the honey bee. Among LABs associated with bee gut microbiota, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (previously Lactobacillus plantarum) and Apilactobacillus kunkeei (formerly classified as Lactobacillus kunkeei) are two of the most abundant species. In this study, four Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains and four Apilactobacillus kunkeei strains, isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) were selected for their in vitro inhibition ability of Paenibacillus larvae ATCC 9545 and Melissococccus plutonius ATCC 35311. In addition, these LABs have been characterized through some biochemical and functional characteristics: cell surface properties (hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation), carbohydrates assimilation and enzymatic activities. The antimicrobial, biochemical and cell surface properties of these LABs have been functional to their candidature as potential probiotics in beekeeping and for the biocontrol of AFB and EFB diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report describes a case of reconstruction after hemipelvectomy for an osteoma in a cat using a 3D-printed pelvic endoprosthesis and micro total hip replacement (mTHR). A 5-year-old spayed female Turkish Angora cat was referred for a 1-month history of constipation and intermittent weight-bearing lameness in the left hindlimb. An osteoma in the pelvis measuring 4.5 &#215; 3 &#215; 5.4 cm was identified based on diagnostic examinations. A left mid-to-caudal partial and right caudal partial hemipelvectomy, and a left femoral head and neck osteotomy, were planned to remove the mass. Reconstruction of the bone defect using 3D-printed metal endoprosthesis and mTHR in the left hindlimb was intended. During right caudal partial hemipelvectomy, right femoral head and neck osteotomy was performed because there was infiltration in the medial wall of the acetabulum. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an osteoma. Two weeks post-surgery, surgical debridement and femoral stem removal were performed because of delayed wound healing and sciatic neurapraxia, leading to femoral stem dislocation from the cup. The delayed wound healing and sciatic neurapraxia were appropriately addressed. The cat regained normal weight and defecation 4 weeks post-operatively. Two years post-surgery, the patient recovered with an almost normal gait. Hemipelvectomy with 3D-printed endoprosthesis provides a safe surgical option with favorable outcomes for neoplasms in the pelvis of cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent data suggest that dysbiosis may play a pivotal role in the IBD pathogenesis. As microbiome-based therapeutics that modulate the gut ecology have been proposed as a novel strategy for preventing IBD, the aim of presenting study was to evaluate the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) rat model mainly in terms of microbial shifts to confirm its suitability for dysbiosis study in IBD. Acute colitis was induced using 5% DSS solution for seven days and rats were euthanized five days after DSS removal. The faecal/caecal microbiota was analyzed by next generation sequencing. Disease activity index (DAI) score was evaluated daily. Blood and colon tissue immunophenotyping was assessed by flow cytometry and histological, haematological, and biochemical parameters were also evaluated. The colitis induction was reflected in a significantly higher DAI score and changes in all parameters measured. This study demonstrated significant shifts in the colitis-related microbial species after colitis induction. The characteristic inflammation-associated microbiota could be detected even after a five day-recovery period. Moreover, the DSS-model might contribute to an understanding of the effect of different treatments on extraintestinal organ impairments. The observation that certain bacterial species in the gut microbiota are associated with colitis raises the question of whether these organisms are contributors to, or a consequence of the disease. Despite some limitations, we confirmed the suitability of DSS-induced colitis model to monitor microbial changes during acute colitis, in order to test attractive new microbiome-based therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622767</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic Diversity, Biofilm Formation, and Antibiotic Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolated from Cow, Camel, and Mare with Clinical Endometritis.</Title>	<Abstract>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic bacterium that causes diseases in animals and humans. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence and antibiotic resistance genes of P. aeruginosa isolated from the uterus of cow, camel, and mare with clinical endometritis and their drinking water. Among the 180 uterine swabs and 90 drinking water samples analysed, 54 (20%) P. aeruginosa isolates were recovered. Isolates were identified biochemically to the genus level by the automated Vitek 2 system and genetically by the amplification of the gyrB gene and the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Multilocus sequence typing identified ten different sequence types for the P. aeruginosa isolates. The identification of ST2012 was significantly (p &#8804; 0.05) higher than that of ST296, ST308, ST111, and ST241. The isolates exhibited significantly (p &#8804; 0.05) increased resistance to piperacillin (77.8%), ciprofloxacin (59.3%), gentamicin (50%), and ceftazidime (38.9%). Eight (14.8%) isolates showed resistance to imipenem; however, none of the isolates showed resistance to colistin. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 24 isolates (44.4%) with a multiple antibiotic resistance index ranging from 0.44 to 0.77. MDR was identified in 30 (33.3%) isolates. Furthermore, 38.8% and 9.2% of the isolates exhibited a positive extended-spectrum-&#946;-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo-&#946;-lactamase (MBL) phenotype, respectively. The most prevalent &#946;-lactamase encoding genes were blaTEM and blaCTX-M, however, the blaIPM gene was not detected in any of the isolates. Biofilm formation was observed in 49 (90.7%) isolates classified as: 11.1% weak biofilm producers; 38.9% moderate biofilm producers; 40.7% strong biofilm producers. A positive correlation was observed between the MAR index and biofilm formation. In conclusion, the results highlighted that farm animals with clinical endometritis could act as a reservoir for MDR and virulent P. aeruginosa. The emergence of ESBLs and MBLs producing P. aeruginosa in different farm animals is a public health concern. Therefore, surveillance programs to monitor and control MDR P. aeruginosa in animals are required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These molecules (LPS) target acute inflammatory responses and significant physiological changes. Importantly, E. coli is considered one of the most important bacterial causes of avian colibacillosis that affect domestic turkey industry. However, little information is available about the potential influence of LPS on the biochemical parameters and histopathological changes in turkey poults. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules on serum biomarkers and histopathological changes in turkey poults. The birds were randomly divided into five groups, as follows: group I did not receive any inoculation; group II was inoculated with sterile saline; and groups III, IV, and V were inoculated intraperitoneally with LPS at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg of body weight (BW), respectively. The biochemical parameters and the histopathology of different organs were examined in all birds one day post-inoculation. Our results revealed hypolipidemia, hypoglycemia, a significant decrease in uric acid, and a significant increase in serum activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK), as well as cardiac troponin T concentrations in treated groups. Moreover, there was a significant increase in &#945;1-, &#946;-, and &#947;-globulin concentrations and a decrease in albumin and &#945;2-globulin concentrations in group V. However, a significant increase in &#945;2- and &#947;-globulin levels and a decrease in albumin levels were detected in groups III and IV. In addition, significant decreases in the albumin/globulin ratio were recorded in all LPS-treated groups. Hepatocellular and cardiac muscle necrosis, slight renal changes, and massive pulmonary inflammatory reactions were recorded. This study provides valuable information about serum biomarkers, protein fractions, and histopathological changes in turkey poults treated with LPS for further investigations of pathophysiological mechanisms in avian medicine along with biomedical research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622769</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Current and Future Molecular Diagnostics of Tick-Borne Diseases in Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Ticks and tick-borne diseases such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever pose a significant threat to animal and human health. Tick-borne diseases cause billions of dollars of losses to livestock farmers annually. These losses are partially attributed to the lack of sensitive, robust, cost effective and efficient diagnostic approaches that could detect the infectious pathogen at the early stages of illness. The modern nucleic acid-based multiplex diagnostic approaches have been developed in human medicine but are still absent in veterinary medicine. These powerful assays can screen 384 patient samples at one time, simultaneously detect numerous infectious pathogens in each test sample and provide the diagnostic answer in a few hours. Development, commercialization, and wide use of such high throughput multiplex molecular assays in the cattle tick-borne disease surveillance will help in early detection and control of infectious pathogens in the animal reservoir before community spread and spillover to humans. Such approaches in veterinary medicine will save animal life, prevent billions of dollars of economic loss to cattle herders and reduce unwanted stress to both human and animal health care systems. This literature review provides recent updates on molecular diagnostics of tick-borne pathogens and discusses the importance of modern nucleic acid high throughput multiplex diagnostic approaches in the prevention of tick-borne infection to livestock.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A "One-Health" Study on Human-Animal Interaction in a Region with a High Prevalence of Obesity.</Title>	<Abstract>Obesity in humans is a growing global problem and is one of the greatest public health challenges we face today. Most researchers agree that, as in humans, the incidence in the companion animal population is also increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors contributing to canine obesity in a region with a high rate of human obesity (Canary Islands, Spain), co-occurrence of obesogenic risk factors, and a canine population with a high percentage of unneutered dogs. We have focused on owner risk factors that promote obesity in humans, such as weight, lifestyle, nutritional habits, and low physical activity, among others. Thus, the human-animal interaction relationship that contributes to human obesity and influences canine obesity has been studied. A multicentre cross-sectional analytical study of 198 pairs of dogs from urban households and their owners was used. A multivariable logistic regression study was completed to analyse owner characteristics variables associated with canine obesity. This transdisciplinary study was conducted with physicians and veterinarians using a "One Health" approach. Our results suggest that, in a region of high obesogenic risk, obese/overweight dogs are primarily female, older than 6 years, and neutered. Being an overweight dog owner was found to be the most important factor in the occurrence of obesity in dogs. Owners of overweight dogs were mainly females, older than 40 years, who did not engage in any physical activity. A strong correlation has been found between dog owners with low levels of education and obesity in their dogs. We suggest that veterinarians should develop and design strategies to encourage pet owners to engage in physical activity with their dogs for the benefit of both.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622772</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Relationship among Serum Progestagens, Cortisol, and Prolactin in Pregnant and Cycling Asian Elephants in Thailand.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of this study was to examine relationships among serum progestagens, cortisol, and prolactin in pregnant and normal cycling Asian elephants living in tourist camps in northern Thailand. Samples were collected twice a month for 22 months from nine elephants. Of those, four were pregnant (24.3 &#177; 2.9 years of age; range 21&#8722;28 years) and five (20.2 &#177; 9.6 years; range 8&#8722;34 years) exhibited normal ovarian cycles based on serum progestagen analyses. Gestation was divided into three periods: 1st (week 1&#8722;31), 2nd (week 32&#8722;62), and 3rd (week 63 to parturition), while the estrous cycle was divided into the follicular and luteal phases. Serum progestagens were higher during the luteal phase of the cycle (p &lt; 0.003), whereas cortisol and prolactin were similar. In pregnant elephants, there were no differences in serum progestagens or cortisol concentrations across the three gestational periods, whereas prolactin concentrations increased significantly during the 2nd and 3rd periods (p &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, prolactin concentrations in nonpregnant elephants were consistently low throughout the ovarian cycle. In one cycling female, prolactin concentrations were similar to pregnant elephants, perhaps because she was an allomother to two calves. Another cycling female exhibited consistently elevated cortisol concentrations, 5 to 10 times higher than the other elephants. There were no correlations between serum progestagens, cortisol, and prolactin throughout gestation; however, serum progestagens and cortisol were positively related in cycling elephants (r = 0.386, p &lt; 0.001). From our results, there were a number of individual differences in reproductive hormonal patterns, so it is important to develop personalized monitoring programs for each elephant to enhance breeding success and create sustaining captive populations of elephants in Asia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35622773</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Escherichia coli in Dogs with Pyometra and the Influence of Diet on the Intestinal Colonization of Extraintestinal Pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC).</Title>	<Abstract>Despite its high frequency and clinical relevance, the pathogenesis of canine pyometra remains poorly understood. The most accepted hypothesis is that bacteria involved ascend from the intestinal tract, causing the uterine infection. Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is the most frequent pathogen in canine pyometra, accounting for 57-100% of cases. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of phylogenetic groups and virulence factors in E. coli strains isolated from the uterine and rectal swabs of bitches with pyometra (n = 72) and from rectal swabs from healthy bitches fed commercial dry feed (n = 53) or a raw meat-based diet (RMBD; n = 38). A total of 512 strains of E. coli were isolated and divided into five categories according to the origin of the sample: 120 isolates from the uterine content of dogs with E. coli pyometra, 102 from the feces of bitches with E. coli pyometra, 75 from the feces of bitches without E. coli pyometra, 130 feces samples from healthy dogs fed commercial feed, and 85 feces samples from healthy dogs fed a raw meat-based diet. E. coli strains belonging to the B2 phylogroup and positive for virulence factor genes associated with adhesion (fimbriae type P [papC]) and production of toxins (&#945;-hemolysin [hlyA] and uropathogenic specific protein [usp]) predominated in the uterine content and rectal swabs of bitches with E. coli pyometra. Interestingly, a lower growth rate of E. coli from the B2 phylogroup was observed in dogs fed a RMBD than in those fed commercial dry feed. The present study suggests that intestinal colonization by certain types of E. coli could be a risk factor for the occurrence of E. coli pyometra in bitches and that diet can influence intestinal colonization by such strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

When exposed to cold weather, which is a risk factor associated with mortality in neonates, pathways such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) are activated to achieve temperature control, increasing the circulating levels of catecholamine and cortisol. Consequently, alterations in blood circulation and mechanisms to produce or to retain heat (e.g., vasoconstriction, piloerection, shivering, brown adipocyte tissue activation, and huddling) begin to prevent hypothermia. This study aimed to discuss the mechanisms of thermoregulation in newborn domestic mammals, highlighting the differences between altricial and precocial species. The processes that employ brown adipocyte tissue, shivering, thermoregulatory behaviors, and dermal vasomotor control will be analyzed to understand the physiology and the importance of implementing techniques to promote thermoregulation and survival in the critical post-birth period of mammals. Also, infrared thermography as a helpful method to perform thermal measurements without animal interactions does not affect these parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This information is important to understand the physiological differences between Cetartiodactyla domesticated species such as cow, pig, and llama and wild species such as hippopotamus, giraffes, and whales. Systematic analysis of changes associated with evolutionary and domestication forces in neuropeptide prohormone protein sequences that are processed into neuropeptides was undertaken. The genomes from 118 Cetartiodactyla genomes representing 22 families were mined for 98 neuropeptide prohormone genes. Compared to other Cetartiodactyla suborders, Ruminantia preserved PYY2 and lost RLN1. Changes in GNRH2, IAPP, INSL6, POMC, PRLH, and TAC4 protein sequences could result in the loss of some bioactive neuropeptides in some families. An evolutionary model suggested that most neuropeptide prohormone genes disfavor sequence changes that incorporate large and hydrophobic amino acids. A compelling finding was that differences between domestic and wild species are associated with the molecular system underlying 'fight or flight' responses. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of simultaneously comparing the neuropeptide prohormone gene complement from close and distant-related species. These findings broaden the foundation for empirical studies about the function of the neuropeptidome associated with health, behavior, and food production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The research focused primarily on the relative morphological changes in primary (thymus and bursa of Fabricius) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid organs with respect to seasonal variations in the histomorphometry of testicular tissue. For this purpose, a comparable number of clinically healthy Japanese quails were exsanguinated during active (April-May), regressive (September-October) and inactive (January-February) reproductive phases. Following an extensive gross measurement of lymphoid and reproductive organs, a histomorphometric analysis was performed on sampled tissues by employing ImageJ[&#174;] software. Blood was collected for hormonal and leukocytic analysis. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical comparison. Testes had the highest parenchymal development in the active phase (80.66 &#177; 21.22 &#181;m) and the lowest in the inactive phase (27.80 &#177; 7.22 &#181;m). Conversely, a percentage change was evident in the sizes of primary (bursa: 61.5%, thymus: 46.9%) and secondary (spleen: 23.9%) lymphoid organs during inactive and active reproductive phases. This study demonstrated that a physiological trade-off is imperative between immune and reproductive systems for optimum survivability and reproductive performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten orthopedically sound adult donkeys were used for US examination of the carpal joint in each forelimb. Additionally, the carpi of ten donkey cadavers were subjected to CT and MRI examinations. The carpal joint was divided into four zones to simplify examination. US assessment of the carpal joint included transverse and longitudinal sonograms. CT was performed using three planes: axial, sagittal, and coronal. MRI was performed using axial and sagittal planes with two sequences: gradient-echo T1-weighted and proton density. The donkeys' carpus US, CT, and MRI images were labeled and serially interpreted based on references and anatomical cross-sections. The anatomical characteristics of the carpal joint and the surrounding soft tissue structures were thoroughly described and precisely differentiated on US, CT, and MRI scans. It can be concluded that US, CT, and MRI are effective noninvasive diagnostic imaging tools for evaluating the carpal joint in donkeys. Moreover, these imaging modalities can aid in establishing a reference database for the carpal joint of donkeys, which differs from that of horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among different metabolic disorders, this syndrome is associated with enhanced subcutaneous lipolysis and visceral adiposity. However, effects of HC in adipose tissue, especially regarding visceral adipose tissue (VAT), are still poorly understood. Herein, the transcriptomic effects of chronic HC on VAT of dogs were evaluated. For this, subcutaneously implanted ACTH-releasing pumps were used, followed by deep RNA sequencing of the canine VAT. Prolonged HC seems to affect a plethora of regulatory mechanisms in VAT of treated dogs, with 1190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, p and FDR &lt; 0.01) being found. The 691 downregulated DEGs were mostly associated with functional terms like cell adhesion and migration, intracellular signaling, immune response, extracellular matrix and angiogenesis. Treatment also appeared to modulate local glucocorticoid and insulin signaling and hormonal sensitivity, and several factors, e.g., TIMP4, FGF1, CCR2, CXCR4 and HSD11B1/2, were identified as possible important players in the glucocorticoid-related expansion of VAT. Modulation of their function during chronic HC might present interesting targets for further clinical studies. Similarities in the effects of chronic HC on VAT of dogs and humans are highlighted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was aimed at describing initial lesions in silicosis, as observed in rats with silica exposure via inhalation, and major histopathologic alterations. Male Wistar rats were exposed to silica for 24 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated the presence of "cellular nodule+ macrophage alveolitis" in rats exposed to silica from the 2-16 weeks time points and "fibrotic cellular + cellular nodule" in rats exposed to silica via inhalation for 24 weeks. By immunohistochemistry, the following were noted: a continual increase in the positive expression of CD68 in macrophages in the lungs of rats exposed to silica; hyperplasia in alveolar type II cells (AT2); loss of original phenotypes in fibrotic cellular nodules, macrophages, and AT2 cells; loss of endothelial cells in silicotic nodules; and positive expression of &#945;-smooth muscle actin in macrophages. Typical pathological changes in silicosis were also summarized. Among these changes were macrophage alveolitis, cellular nodules, and fibrotic cellular nodules, including an increase in minute cellular nodules in the early stages and the formation of fibrotic cellular nodules in the late stages.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among these, the most common is feline fibroadenomatous change, a hyperplastic/dysplastic change associated with hormonal imbalances. Although never thoroughly described in scientific literature, feline fibroadenomas, which share some morphological features with fibroadenomatous change, have been variably included in classification systems. The aim of this study was to characterise feline mammary fibroadenomas from a histological and immunophenotypical point of view in order to allow the standardisation of classification. Nine cases were retrospectively collected from eight female and one male cat with no history of hormonal stimulation. Diagnostic inclusion criteria were defined and immunohistochemistry was performed. Histologically, nodules were composed of neoplastic epithelial cells arranged in arborizing lobular-like structures surrounded by abundant proliferating stroma. In all analysed cases, epithelial elements showed immunolabelling for pancytokeratin, cytokeratin19, and &#946;-catenin. Interestingly, five cases showed multifocal epithelial vimentin positivity. Epithelial nuclear oestrogen receptor positivity was observed in three of the nine samples. In all cases, myoepithelial cells did not extend into the interstitium. Stromal cells expressed vimentin, calponin, and mild &#946;-catenin. The median Ki67 scores were 18% and 8.3% in the epithelial and stromal components, respectively. This study describes, for the first time, the morphological and immunophenotypical features of feline mammary fibroadenoma, highlighting its existence as a separate entity from fibroadenomatous change.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PFOA is identified as a substance of very high concern, as it is classified as a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substance because of its persistence in the environment and its potential accumulation in organisms. Thus, safe levels of exposure cannot be established, and PFOA emissions should be minimized. PFOA has recently been linked to several health concerns in humans. In particular, a disruptive effect on redox status homeostasis has been documented, with a potential impairment of normal reproductive function that requires adequate oxidative balance. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PFOA (2, 20, and 200 ng/mL) on ovarian granulosa cells, a model of reproductive cells. The obtained results reveal that PFOA stimulated cell viability (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding the effects on free radical production, O2&#8722;, NO, and H2O2 were significantly inhibited (p &lt; 0.05), while the nonenzymatic antioxidant power was not significantly modified. Collectively, the present results deserve attention since free radical molecules play a crucial role in ovarian follicle development leading to a successful ovulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Consequently, the dairy farming's primary task is to lower milk losses and other inefficiencies associated with diseased cows. Moreover, a shift from curative to preventive health management would be desirable for mastitis and a wide variety of other infectious and non-infectious cattle diseases, some of which are known to have profound negative effects on the performance and well-being of cows. Differential cell counting (DCC), a procedure that aims to determine the proportions of different somatic cell types in raw milk samples, has not only the potential to optimize mastitis diagnostics, but it could furthermore serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the general and overall health status of dairy cows. Based on a broad search of the literature, the practical utility of various types of DCC is summarized and discussed in this review. Since it might be of advantage to interpret DCC with the aid of data from studies in humans, differences between the immune systems of humans and dairy cattle, with a special focus on surface marker expression profiles and &#947;&#948; (gamma delta) T-cell characteristics, are also described.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to describe the existing veterinary education research literature by adopting the systematic bibliometric approach. We conducted a comprehensive literature exploration on worldwide veterinary education and veterinary communication education publications in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2021. VOSviewer and EXCEL were used to identify trends and patterns in characteristics of the publications, including author affiliations and countries, and the publishing journals.

<Rec><Common><PMID>35737309</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Features, Tumour Localisation, and Survival of Dogs with Presumptive Brain Gliomas.</Title>	<Abstract>Brain gliomas are common tumours diagnosed in dogs. However, limited information is available on the clinical features and overall survival time (OS) in dogs receiving palliative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible associations between presenting complaint, tumour localisation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features, survival times, and reason for the death of dogs with suspected intracranial glioma treated palliatively. Sixty dogs from a single institution were retrospectively included (from September 2017 to December 2021). Dogs were included if a presumptive diagnosis of brain glioma was obtained based on an MRI scan and medical history. French Bulldogs were overrepresented (40/60); 46 out of 60 dogs (77%) presented due to epileptic seizures (ES) and in 25/60 dogs (42%), cluster seizures or status epilepticus were the first manifestation of the disease. Dogs with suspected gliomas located in the piriform lobe showed a higher probability of presenting due to epilepsy compared to dogs with glioma in other regions, and more frequently died or were euthanised because of increased ES. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features differed between localisations. Fronto-olfactory tumours were more frequently, whereas piriform tumours were less frequently, classified as suspected high-grade glioma. The median survival time was 61 days. Dogs with contrast-enhancing suspected gliomas had significantly shorter OS. This study provides additional information on the clinical features and survival of dogs with suspected brain gliomas treated palliatively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

VEEV is classified into six subtypes (I to VI). Subtype I viruses are divided into epizootic (IAB and IC) and endemic strains (ID and IE) that can produce outbreaks or sporadic diseases, respectively. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the phylogeny and the molecular clock of sequences of VEEV subtype I complex and identify mutations within sequences belonging to epizootic or enzootic subtypes focusing on a sequence isolated from a mare in Costa Rica. Bayesian phylogeny of the VEEV subtype I complex tree with 110 VEEV complete genomes was analyzed. Evidence of positive selection was evaluated with Datamonkey server algorithms. The putative effects of mutations on the 3D protein structure in the Costa Rica sequence were evaluated. The phylogenetic analysis showed that Subtype IE-VEEV diverged earlier than other subtypes, Costa Rican VEEV-IE ancestors came from Nicaragua in 1963 and Guatemala in 1907. Among the observed non-synonymous mutations, only 17 amino acids changed lateral chain groups. Fourteen mutations located in the NSP3, E1, and E2 genes are unique in this sequence, highlighting the importance of E1-E2 genes in VEEV evolution.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The piezoelectric cutting tool is a surgical device able to involve only mineralized tissue avoiding neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue. This study aimed to evaluate the sciatic nerve injury observed in dogs underwent iliac osteotomy performed using the piezoelectric cutting tool. (2) Methods: Dogs underwent DPO performed with piezoelectric cutting tool were included. Neurological assessment was performed 6 and 24 h after surgery and then repeated 12 days, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Temporary and or permanent sciatic nerve injury were recorded. (3) Results: 84 DPOs performed in fifty dogs were included. No temporary/permanent neurological disease associated with iatrogenic damage of the sciatic nerve were observed. (4) Conclusions: The iliac osteotomy performed with piezoelectric cutting tool was not associated to iatrogenic sciatic nerve injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, three different types of seminal doses were used for AI depending on the ejaculate fraction included (F1: doses containing only the rich fraction of the ejaculate; F2: F1 + the transition fraction between rich and poor fractions; F3: F2 and poor fraction). The statistical analysis revealed significant differences in some indices regarding the period of analysis (D0, D1, and D5). Diastolic velocity and mean velocity showed lower values at D5 in comparison with D0 and D1 (p &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the pulsatility index and the relationship systolic velocity/diastolic velocity indicated higher values at D5 in comparison with D0 and D1 (p &lt; 0.01). No differences were observed regarding the type of seminal dose used in any of the time points analyzed (p &gt; 0.05). Neither insemination per se nor the type of ejaculate fraction used immediately modified the uterine vascularity, but some indices are affected by the stage of the estrus cycle (estrus vs. early diestrus).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To examine the cyto- and histological components that guarantee the lifelong high productivity of equine pulp, a limited number of ten incisors and ten cheek teeth from seven adult horses (aged 5 to 24 years) and five foals were sampled for preliminary histomorphometric and histomorphological evaluations. Independently of age, the equine dental pulp featured constant layers of predentin and odontoblastic cells, as well as soft connective tissue, composed of a cellular fibrous matrix, in which blood vessels and nerve fibers were embedded. As a result of the progressive deposition of newly formed dentin, the layer of dentin became thicker with age, and the size of the pulp chamber decreased. In contrast to the brachydont teeth, the morphological characteristics of the odontoblastic layer and the width of the predentin layer did not change with age. Therefore, it is assumed that the equine pulp tissue retained their juvenile status, which explains its unchanged ability to produce high amounts of subocclusal dentin. These preliminary, but clinically significant, findings are worthy of further investigation in order to identify strategies for equine-specific endodontic therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35737314</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Overweight Management through Mild Caloric Restriction in Multigenerational Long-Tailed Macaque Breeding Groups.</Title>	<Abstract>Caloric restriction (CR) is an effective method to reduce overweight in captive non-human primates (NHPs). CR has been applied to individually- and pair-housed NHPs, but whether applying CR can be effective and safe in group-housed NHPs has not yet been assessed. This study investigates the effect of mild (20%) CR on adult overweight and biochemical parameters, immature growth, veterinary consultations, and reproductive success in multigenerational long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) breeding groups. Data were derived from anthropometric measurements and blood samples during yearly health checks, complemented with retrospective data on veterinary consultations and reproductive success. Adult body measures decreased after CR, with heavier individuals and females losing more weight compared to leaner individuals and males. CR lowered cholesterol levels in adults but had no overall effect on other biochemical parameters. Yet, biochemical parameters of individuals with high baseline values were reduced more compared to individuals with low baseline values. Immature growth, veterinary consultations and reproductive success were not influenced by CR. Thus, CR targeted the right individuals, i.e., overweight adults, and had no adverse effects on the variables examined in this study. This implies that mild CR can be a valuable overweight management strategy in group-housed NHPs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Crossbred Thai indigenous chickens, designated KKU1 and KKU2, were compared. The data included 1375 records of body weight (BW0, BW2, BW4, and BW16), breast circumference at 6 weeks of age (BrC6), and average daily gain (ADG0&#8722;2, ADG0&#8722;4, and ADG0&#8722;6). A multi-trait animal model with the average information-restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML) was used to estimate the genetic parameters and breeding values. The results showed that the body weight and breast circumference traits (BW2, BW4, BW6, and BrC6) for the mixed sex KKU1 chickens were higher than for the KKU2 chickens (p &lt; 0.05). For the growth performance traits, the KKU1 chickens had higher average daily gain and feed intake and a lower feed conversion ratio than the KKU2 chickens (p &lt; 0.05). The survival rates were not different except at up to 6 weeks of age, when that of the KKU1 chickens was slightly lower. The specific combining ability, heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations, and estimated breeding values showed that the KKU1 chickens had better genetics than the KKU2 chickens. In conclusion, KKU1 chickens are suitable for development as crossbred Thai indigenous chickens for enhanced growth performance and for commercial use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have been reported in Salmonella isolated from wild and captive reptiles. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of Salmonella AMR carriage by chelonians admitted to two zoological institutions in Spain, characterizing the isolates to assess the Salmonella AMR epidemiology in wildlife. To this end, 152 chelonians from nine species were sampled upon their arrival at the zoological nuclei. Salmonella identification was based on ISO 6579-1:2017 (Annex D), isolates were serotyped and their AMR analysed according to the EU Decision 2013/652. Moreover, the genetic relationship of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results showed 19% (29/152) of the chelonians positive to Salmonella, all of them tortoises. For all isolates, 69% (20/29) were resistant and 34% (10/29) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. PFGE clustered isolates according to the serovar, confirming a low genetic diversity. In conclusion, this study shows a high presence of MDR Salmonella strains in tortoises at their entry into zoological nuclei. This condition highlights the need to establish Salmonella detection protocols for the entry of animals into these centres.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A one-year-old castrated male Great Dane was presented with clinical signs of an ulcerated nodule on the right ear, which was observed after two weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and prednisolone due to idiopathic hepatitis. Cytological examination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammatory cells and blanched filamentous rods. To detect infectious agents, serosanguinous discharge of the nodule was subjected to bacterial and fungal cultures. For phenotyping of the infectious agents, colonies on blood agar culture plates were further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (VITEK MS). The MALDI-TOF spectra were identified as N. africana. Thus, the present case was diagnosed as cutaneous nocardiosis. The skin lesions of ulcerated nodules with fistulous tracts were gradually resolved by the administration of meropenem (8 mg/kg TID, IV) and doxycycline (5 mg/kg BID, PO). Although complete resolution of the skin lesions was observed on day 91 after the initial presentation, single administration of doxycycline was continued until day 198 after the initial presentation to prevent recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Nocardia africana infection in a dog. In addition, our results show that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis could be a useful tool for the detection of Nocardia. spps.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted. Medical records from proteinuric dogs (urinary protein&#8722;creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5) presented to a Veterinary Teaching Hospital over a two-year period were reviewed for signalment, established diagnosis, proteinuria origin, and CVBD screening results. A total of 106 dogs were included. The median age was 9.5 years old (IQR: 7&#8722;12). Proteinuria was considered of renal origin in 76% of cases (46% of them had a presumptive diagnosis of glomerulonephritis secondary to CVBD, 27% chronic kidney disease, 26% systemic disease possible to induce proteinuria, and 1% leptospirosis). Proteinuria was classified as post-renal or mixed-origin in 17% and 7% of cases, respectively. About 35% of proteinuric dogs were positive for at least one CVBD. Of them, 84% were seropositive for one CVBD, while 16% tested positive for two or more. Among dogs testing positive for CVBD, 89% were seropositive for Leishmania infantum. This study showed that about one-third of proteinuric dogs tested positive for CVBDs, highlighting the relevance of their screening in dogs with proteinuria living in endemic regions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among them, honey has been highlighted to improve health and control inflammatory processes. However, there is no study elucidating the mechanism of action of honey produced organically. Here, we separated organic honey (OH) samples from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest into eight different profiles (OH-1 to OH-8) and evaluated, in vitro and in vivo, their anti-inflammatory potential. To determine cell viability, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with several concentrations of OH-1 up to OH-8, and anti-inflammatory activity was assessed through NF-&#954;B activation and TNF-&#945; levels. All types of the studied honey up to a concentration of 4% (w/v) did not interfere with macrophage viability and decreased NF-kB activation and TNF-&#945; levels in macrophage culture in vitro. OH-7 was selected as the most promising anti-inflammatory and used in subsequent assays. Mice pretreated orally with OH-7 showed a decrease in neutrophil migration and TNF-&#945; level. Thus, these types of Brazilian organic honey show promising anti-inflammatory potential, particularly the OH-7 variety. Brazilian organic honey may lead to the development of new products and/or be incorporated into food for use in veterinary medicine and human health as well.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among these, histamine is considered one of the most toxic. The purpose of the present study is to assess the occurrence of histamine in fish-based pet foods, and to evaluate the changes in histamine content during storage at different temperatures. For the analysis, an LC-MS/MS method was used. Fifty-eight pet foods were purchased, and an aliquot of them was analyzed just after opening the packages. Histamine was detected in 12 samples and concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 30.1 mg/kg. The remaining of each positive sample was divided into seven subsamples. One of them was used as a control sample and kept at -20 &#176;C, while the other six were exposed to different environmental conditions. Samples exposed to room temperature showed no significant changes in histamine levels, while samples exposed to high temperatures showed significant increases in histamine content. Finally, samples exposed to refrigerator temperature showed a slight decrease in histamine levels. Under the experimental conditions, the EU limit of 100 mg/kg established for fishery products was never exceeded. These results seem to indicate a low risk of histamine intoxication in cats fed fish-based pet food.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A survey in the town of Waialua on the north shore of Oahu island indicated that creeping indigo is common and abundant on grazing lands during the rainy season and requires intensive chemical and physical control measures. Four pastures were surveyed where ranchers reported mortality of more than 17 horses since 2020. We document these incidents to alert state animal and livestock support officials, groups monitoring invasive species, and horse owners regarding the problem of this noxious weed and to support breeders with information to confront its invasiveness. Herbicide treatment is not economically feasible, and breeders opted to physically uproot the plants from the paddocks and restrain horses to clear pastures as they were eliminating the plants. We urge state officials for a long-term control strategy to reduce the problems associated with this weed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To meet the need for timely and accurate virus detection, laboratories used rapid Ag tests and PCR kits based on costly multi-channel real-time techniques. This study aimed to develop a conventional nested PCR based on the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, validate it against some approved assays, and apply it to samples from six cats with respiratory symptoms obtained in early 2020 during the first COVID-19 wave in humans in Bulgaria. The nested PCR technique showed 100% sensitivity and specificity; it could detect extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA at concentrations as low as 0.015 ng/&#956;L. The results identified the six tested cat samples as positive. Sequence analysis performed in two of them confirmed this. The presented technique is reliable, easy to implement and inexpensive, and can be successful in strategies for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, cats and other susceptible species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The utility of computed tomography (CT) in the detection and characterization of parathyroid diseases in dogs has not been assessed to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the use of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) for the diagnosis of parathyroid disease in dogs. For this descriptive, single-center study, the database of the San Marco Veterinary Clinic was searched for dogs having a suspicion of parathyroid disease who underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT in the period from 2005 to 2021. Dogs with histopathology of the affected parathyroid gland were subsequently considered for inclusion. A total of 22 parathyroid glands were included: 12 adenomas, 8 adenocarcinomas, and two glands with hyperplasia. Several CT features were evaluated, including parathyroid gland affected, lateralization, shape, size, attenuation, and contrast-enhancement. Although the overlap between the appearance of different diseases exists, contrast-enhanced CT was a useful method for the diagnosis of parathyroid disease in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Epidemiological data on CVBPs, obtained during 10 years of pre-donor screening (2012&#8722;2021) by a veterinary blood bank in central Italy, were used to conduct a retrospective epidemiological longitudinal survey. The results were obtained using the Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) conducted on sera in order to assess IgG antibodies against Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocythophilum, Babesia canis, and Rickettsia conorii; the modified Knott&#8217;s test and an ELISA kit were used to detect Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens. In total, 324 out of the 1260 canine blood donors (25.71%) tested seropositive for at least one pathogen. The highest overall positive rate was detected for L. infantum (12.22%), followed by E. canis (2.30%), A. phagocytophilum (1.19%), D. repens (0.95%), D. immitis (0.32%), and B. canis (0.16%). From 2012 to 2014, a prevalence of 20.12% was recorded for R. conorii. Mixed infections were recorded in 21 dogs. For all the CVBPs investigated, significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were not observed over the period studied. The results evidenced a non-negligible prevalence of CVBPs in canine donors, which were selected based on strict criteria concerning regular endo- and ectoparasite controls. The results confirmed that the blood bank could be a reliable local epidemiological observatory. The need for implemented screening is discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, in some cases, unnecessary courses of antibiotics are empirically prescribed. Recent studies in humans have hypothesized the use of antioxidants as a possible alternative and/or support to antimicrobial drugs in uncomplicated cases. Considering the global need to reduce the antibiotic use, the aim of the study was to compare the oxidative burden of the diarrhetic population to that of healthy dogs. Forty-five patients suffering from uncomplicated acute diarrhea (AD) and 30 controls were screened for clinical and biochemical parameters, and serum redox indices (reactive oxygen metabolites, dROMs; serum antioxidant capacity, SAC; oxidative stress index, OSi). The average levels of dROMs in AD dogs were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than in healthy dogs, while SAC did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the OSi values (ratio between dROMs and SAC) significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001) in AD dogs compared to controls. The study demonstrates that canine AD could induce redox imbalance. Although its role in the etiopathogenesis and evolution of the disease should be further investigated, our results suggest that the improvement of the patient oxidative status, possibly through the dietary administration of antioxidants, could support the management of canine AE, reducing the use of antibiotics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, the development of cattle genetically resistant to BLV is desirable. The purpose of this study was to identify novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to resistance to BLV. A total of 146 DNA samples from cattle with high BLV proviral loads (PVLs) and 142 samples from cattle with low PVLs were used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). For the verification of the GWAS results, an additional 1342 and 456 DNA samples from BLV-infected Japanese Black and Holstein cattle, respectively, were used for an SNP genotyping PCR to compare the genotypes for the identified SNPs and PVLs. An SNP located on the spermatogenesis associated 16 (SPATA16)-coding region on bovine chromosome 1 was found to exceed the moderate threshold (p &lt; 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;5) in the Additive and Dominant models of the GWAS. The SNP genotyping PCR revealed that the median values of the PVL were 1278 copies/50 ng of genomic DNA for the major homozygous, 843 for the heterozygous, and 621 for the minor homozygous genotypes in the Japanese Black cattle (p &lt; 0.0001). A similar tendency was also observed in the Holstein cattle. We found that cattle with the minor allele for this SNP showed 20&#8722;25% lower PVLs. Although the mechanisms through which this SNP impacts the PVL remain unknown, we found a novel SNP related to BLV resistance located on the SPATA16 gene-coding region on bovine chromosome 1.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main objective of this study is to define if there is a relation between lung function measured by barometric whole-body plethysmography and obesity in cats with bronchoconstriction. Fifty-three cats were included in the study. All animals presented a bronchoconstriction status diagnosed with an Enhanced Pause (Penh) value higher than the reference range. Based on a standardized 9-point body condition scale, 36 cats were normal-weight cats (with BCS &lt; 6), and 17 cats were considered overweight or obese cats (with BCS &#8805; 6). Overweight cats were mainly male cats and older, and presented lower tidal volume values, lower minute volume values, and lower peak inspiratory and expiratory flows than normal-weight cats. According to the results of the present study, overweight cats showed a more compromised lung function parameters related to restrictive pattern compared with normal-weight cats. However, overweight cats did not show a higher bronchoconstriction level compared with normal-weight cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This was a prospective single-arm pilot study. Client-owned dogs with treatment-na&#239;ve cytologically confirmed MCTs were enrolled. Patients underwent an initial incisional biopsy followed by a 10-14-day course of anti-inflammatory prednisone and surgical resection. All histological samples were randomized, masked, and evaluated by a single pathologist. Unstained paired pre- and post-treatment samples were submitted to a commercial laboratory for Ki67 and AgNOR immunohistochemical analysis. There were 11 dogs enrolled with 11 tumors. There were no statistical differences between the pre- and post-treatment histological parameters of mitotic index, Ki67, AgNOR, or Ki67xAgNOR. There were no clinically significant alterations between pre-treatment and post-treatment in the assignment of tumor grades. A short course of anti-inflammatory prednisone does not appear to alter the histological parameters that affect grade determination or significantly alter the proliferation indices in canine MCTs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, farming practices, productivity, health and the economic value of sheep were evaluated in PATA through a survey of farmers (n = 138) holding 11,558 heads of sheep. Out of a total population, 87% were non-descriptive flocks, and 9% and 4% were purebred flocks belonging to the Kajli and Thali populations, respectively. Sheep flocks were mainly (86%) reared under the traditional production system and had a delayed onset of puberty. There was low influence of season on the reproduction, and the majority of flocks (78%) were bred throughout the year. The lack of proper vaccination and poor management exposed the flocks to bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, which lead to high mortality in lambs (~22%) and adults (~32%). The share of sheep in farmers livelihood was 42%, and only 20% of producers' living standard was improved with sheep farming, but the rise in rearing more sheep was quite low (20%). Although the livestock department arranged farmers' training, the majority of farmers (83%) never participated in training and had no knowledge of modern technologies. Collectively, the traditional sheep production systems, poor management, lack of vaccination, marketing channels and farmers training hampered the sheep rearing and producers' livelihood in the PATA of Punjab-Pakistan. However, developing model livestock farms, conducting farmer training, establishing a viable market for dairy products, and introducing subsidy policy interventions can improve the sheep farming in these areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Inguinal hernias are assumed to be relatively common in male nonhuman primates. Clinical signs are usually limited to a visible or palpable mass in the groin region without pain or systemic illness. Most hernias contain omentum. Careful monitoring is an acceptable treatment option for those animals. Size, the danger of incarceration, and the presence of strangulation are important factors when considering surgical repair. A strangulated inguinal hernia is an emergency, requiring prompt surgery to avoid tissue necrosis and death. Imaging techniques, as well as computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide information about the anatomical characteristics of the suspected region, allowing for a diagnosis and treatment. An inguinal hernia repair can be performed with either open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. The hernia repair can be achieved by mesh or suture. Decisions regarding which repair technique to use depend on the surgeon's skill level and preference. Complication and recurrence rates are generally low. The most common postsurgical complication is a recurrence of the hernia. Contraceptive measures are not indicated in breeders, as there is no known hereditary component, and the presence of hernia does not appear to affect fertility, nor does it predispose to occurrence, recurrence, or incarceration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This condition may be associated with adhesion of the edges of the upper and lower eyelids (ankyloblepharon). The present case describes bilateral symblepharon, ankyloblepharon and salt gland dysfunction in a juvenile Caretta caretta. The loggerhead presented both eyelids swollen, ulcerated, and not separable when rescued. Eye examination was not possible, but ultrasonography showed right bulbar integrity, while the left eye was smaller, with a thicker cornea that had lost its normal doubled lined structure. Surgical dissection of the fibrous adhesions between the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and third eyelid was performed, and large dacryoliths were removed. The microscopic findings were consistent with chronic keratoconjunctivitis. Ultrastructurally, no virus-like particles were observed. In addition, tissue samples were negative for herpesvirus by qualitative PCR. The eyelids of both eyes and the corneal epithelium of the right eye healed; moreover, the vision was restored in the right eye. There were no recurrences after 12 months of follow-up, and the turtle was released 16 months after the end of treatments on the southern Tyrrhenian coast in the western Mediterranean Sea. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of symblepharon with ankyloblepharon and salt gland dysfunction in Caretta caretta turtle. Ocular ultrasonography was helpful in the preliminary diagnostic work-up.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Antimicrobial resistance correlated with colistin has emerged as a critical concern worldwide in the veterinary field and the public health sector. The current study investigated the prevalence of multidrug-resistant avian pathogenic Escherichia coli among chicken farms in three Egyptian governorates, focusing on colistin resistance assessment. A total of 56 Escherichia coli isolates were recovered out of 120 pooled samples obtained from diseased chicken broilers (46.7%). The E. coli isolates were serotyped to nine different serotypes; the highest incidence was for O125 (n = 18). The E. coli isolates demonstrated multidrug-resistant patterns against 10 antibiotics, especially clindamycin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ampicillin, by 100, 100, 96.4 and 92.9%, respectively. On the other hand, colistin resistance was 41.1% using AST. All E. coli isolates displayed positive colistin resistance growth on chromogenic medium, but only 25% represented this positivity via MIC estimation and Sensititre kit. PCR results revealed that all isolates harbored mcr-1, but no isolates harbored the other 2-5 mcr genes. In conclusion, the study demonstrated the emergence of multidrug-resistant, especially colistin-resistant, E. coli among chicken broiler flocks, and mcr-1 is the master gene of the colistin resistance feature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to determine the prevalence and identify predictors of radiographically apparent UUT uroliths in dog breeds at increased risk for calcium oxalate uroliths (CaOx risk breeds) and mixed breed dogs. Radiologist reports of three-view abdominal radiographs were reviewed from 251 purebred dogs of 8 CaOx risk breeds and 68 mixed breed dogs. UUT uroliths were more common in CaOx risk breeds than mixed breed dogs (23% versus 6%, respectively; OR = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7&#8722;18.9, p &lt; 0.001). UUT uroliths were more common in dogs with lower urinary tract (LUT) uroliths (predominantly calcium-containing) than those without (41% versus 5%, respectively; OR = 13.6, 95% CI 6.3&#8722;33.1, p &lt; 0.001), and LUT uroliths predicted the presence of UUT uroliths in the multivariable regression (OR = 6.5, 95% CI 2.8&#8722;16.7, p &lt; 0.001). Increasing age (p &lt; 0.001) and lower body weight (p = 0.0016) were also predictors of UUT urolith presence in the multivariable regression. The high prevalence of UUT uroliths in dogs with LUT uroliths supports a shared mechanism for their formation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a virus vehicle has been reported in mouse models and canine and human patients, but the actual action mechanism has never been described in patients. It is of importance to determine whether MSCs infected with OAds can reach the tumor and release the virus in a clinical setting. For this purpose, GFP-labeled MSCs were infected with an OAd and inoculated into a companion dog diagnosed with spontaneous lung carcinoma. Forty-eight hours later, the tumor was excised and analyzed microscopically by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence detection, and a cellular culture was established. Peripheral blood samples were taken to quantify the oncolytic adenovirus by qRT-PCR. Green fluorescence cells detected in the cellular culture by microscopy and flow cytometry revealed 0.69% GFP-positive cells in the tumor. OAd in peripheral blood was confirmed by qRT-PCR during follow-up. For the first time, the tumoral-homing capacity of OAds infected-MSC has been confirmed in a clinical setting, helping to explain the clinical response mechanism, whose efficacy was previously reported in canine and human patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In infected herds the disease causes considerable financial loss due to mortality, slow growth rates, poor feed conversion, and costs of treatment. B. hyodysenteriae is the most common etiological agent of SD and infection is usually associated with disease. However, isolated reports have described low pathogenic strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The aim of this study was to describe an experimental infection trial using a subclinical B. hyodysenteriae isolated from an animal without clinical signs and from a disease-free herd, to evaluate the pathogenicity and clinical pathological characteristics compared to a highly clinical isolate. Forty-eight 5-week-old pigs were divided into three groups: control, clinical and the subclinical isolates. The first detection/isolation of B. hyodysenteriae in samples of the animals challenged with a known clinical B. hyodysenteriae strain (clinical group) occurred 5th day post inoculation. Considering the whole period of the study, 11/16 animals from this group were qPCR positive in fecal samples, and diarrhea was observed in 10/16 pigs. In the subclinical isolate group, one animal had diarrhea. There were SD large intestine lesions in 3 animals at necropsy and positive B. hyodysenteriae isolation in 7/15 samples of the subclinical group. In the control group, no diarrhea, gross/microscopic lesions, or qPCR positivity were observed. Clinical signs, bacterial isolation, macroscopic and histologic lesions were significantly difference among groups, demonstrating low pathogenicity of the subclinical isolate in susceptible pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35737339</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Flow Cytometric Analysis of Leukocyte Populations in the Lung Tissue of Dromedary Camels.</Title>	<Abstract>Respiratory tract infections are among the most common infections in dromedary camels, with a high impact on animal health, production, and welfare. Tissue-specific distribution of immune cells is one of the important factors that influence the nature and outcome of the immune response to pathogens. Several protocols have recently been described for the flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in the lung tissue of several species. However, no such protocol currently exists for dromedary camels. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to establish a flow cytometric protocol for the identification of immune cell populations in the camel lung tissue and the evaluation of some of their phenotypic and functional properties. Combined staining of camel lung leukocytes with monoclonal antibodies to the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 and the myeloid cell marker CD172a allowed the identification of myeloid cells (CD45[+]CD172a[+]) and lymphoid cells (CD45[+]CD172a[-]) in the lung of healthy camels. The cell adhesion molecules CD11a and CD18 were found in a higher abundance on myeloid cells compared to lymphoid cells. Based on their differential expression of the LPS receptor CD14, macrophages (CD172a[+]CD14[high] cells) were identified as the most abundant immune cell population in the camel lung tissue. In contrast to their dominance in camel peripheral blood, granulocytes (CD172a[+]CD14[low]) presented only a minor population in the lung tissue. The higher frequency of &#947;&#948; T cells in the lung tissue than in peripheral blood suggests a role for these cells in the pulmonary immune system. Flow cytometric analysis of bacterial phagocytosis and ROS production upon bacterial stimulation revealed high antimicrobial activity of camel lung phagocytes, which was comparable with the antimicrobial activity of blood granulocytes. Comparative analysis of immune cell distribution between the cranial and caudal lobes of the camel lung revealed a higher frequency of granulocytes and a lower frequency of macrophages in the cranial compared to the caudal lung lobe. In addition, the higher frequency of cells expressing the M2 macrophage marker CD163 in the caudal lung tissue, with a slightly higher fraction of MHCII-positive cells (M1 phenotype) in the cranial lung tissue, may suggest the distribution of different macrophage subtypes in the different lobes of the camel lung. Such differences between lung lobes could influence the effectiveness of the immune response to infection or vaccination with respiratory pathogens. Collectively, the present study identified some similarities and differences between camels and other farm animals regarding the distribution of the main immune cell populations in their lungs. Further studies are required for comprehensive immunophenotyping of the cellular pulmonary immune system in camels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Six databases were searched for studies examining umbilical health in an intensively raised cattle population. There were 4249 articles initially identified; from these, 723 full text articles were then screened, with 150 articles included in the review. Studies were conducted in the USA (n = 41), Brazil (n = 24), Canada (n = 13), UK (n = 10), and 37 additional countries. Seventeen were classified as descriptive, 24 were clinical trials, and 109 were analytical observational studies. Umbilical outcomes evaluated in descriptive studies were infection (n = 11), parasitic infection (n = 5), and hernias (n = 2). Of the clinical trials, only one examined treatment of navel infections; the remainder evaluated preventative management factors for navel health outcomes (including infections (n = 17), myiasis (n = 3), measurements (n = 5), hernias (n = 1), and edema (n = 1)). Analytical observational studies examined risk factors for umbilical health (n = 60) and umbilical health as a risk factor (n = 60). Studies examining risk factors for umbilical health included navel health outcomes of infections (n = 28; 11 of which were not further defined), hernias (n = 8), scoring the navel sheath/flap size (n = 16), myiasis (n = 2), and measurements (n = 6). Studies examining umbilical health as a risk factor defined these risk factors as infection (n = 39; of which 13 were not further defined), hernias (n = 8; of which 4 were not further defined), navel dipping (n = 12), navel/sheath scores as part of conformation classification for breeding (n = 2), measurements (n = 3), and umbilical cord drying times (n = 2). This review highlights the areas in need of future umbilical health research such as clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different treatments for umbilical infection. It also emphasizes the importance for future studies to clearly define umbilical health outcomes of interest, and consider standardization of these measures, including time at risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 1210 goats of Eghoria (n = 418), Skopelos (n = 429), and Damascus (n = 363) breeds were assessed. Udder health, parasitic resistance, welfare, milk yield and quality, and body condition score were recorded monthly for two milking periods. Udder health records included somatic cell count (SCC) and total viable count (TVC). Based on combinations of SCC and TVC and thresholds set at &gt;106 cells/mL and &gt;2 &#215; 104 cfu/mL, respectively, additional udder health phenotypes were defined. Parasitism included myiasis, tick infestation, gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) and cestode faecal egg count (FEC), and lungworm faecal larval count (FLC). Infection with each of the endoparasites was defined based on FEC/FLC. Welfare assessment parameters included the presence of ear and horn injuries, ocular and nasal discharge, body and udder abscesses, injury and lesions on the skin of different regions, diarrhoea, hernias, overgrown hooves, arthritis, lameness, and udder asymmetry. Trait repeatability and animal correlations were estimated. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) repeatability was reported for all udder health and most welfare traits in all breeds, GIN and cestode FEC, and GIN and lungworm infection in Eghoria, and myiasis in Skopelos. Correlations of health and most of welfare traits with performance were non-significant or favourable. Overall, results demonstrate potential to improve health and welfare of the studied breeds without compromising performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 216 one-day-old male Ross-308 chicks were randomly allocated to three treatment groups with six replications (12 chicks per pen). Three isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were formulated to include the examined silage at 0%, 5%, or 10%. Commercial breeding and management procedures were employed throughout the trial. At the end of the trial (day 35), tissue samples were collected for analysis. Feeding 10% silage resulted in increased (p &#8804; 0.001) final body weight (p &#8804; 0.001) and feed intake. Jejunum and cecum microflora, as well as breast and thigh meat microflora, were modified (p &#8804; 0.05) by the dietary inclusion. Thigh meat oxidative stability was improved (p &lt; 0.01) by the silage supplementation. In addition, breast and thigh meat fatty acid profiles were different, respectively, (p &lt; 0.05) in the supplemented treatments compared to the control. The examined silage was successfully tested in broiler diets with potential benefits for their performance and meat quality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sixteen intestinal samples from two veterinary diagnostic services (2014-2017) were included in the study. A histopathological criterion classified the cases into three grades (mild, moderate, and severe) according to the distribution of the lesions and the course. An immunohistochemical study of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, and transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF-&#946;1) was performed in each case. An immunohistochemical study of mild grades shows greater collagen III immunoexpression, compared to collagen I and fibronectin, which suggests an "early" stage of fibrosis. In more intense grades, an increased immunoexpression of collagen I, compared to collagen III, suggests a "late" stage of fibrosis. Otherwise, the highest expression of TGF-&#946;1 was observed in the moderate phase, due to the high proliferation of reactive fibroblast and intense inflammation. The results suggest that the inflammatory infiltrate is the trigger for the elevation in TGF-&#946;1, altering the collagen type III:I ratio. In conclusion, immunohistochemical studies can be a very useful method in diagnosing cases of FGESF of mild grades and could help to apply a differential diagnosis regarding feline eosinophilic chronic enteritis (CEE) in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The pig business in Vietnam was recently affected by ASF for the first time. This study thus aimed to develop a disease dynamic model to explain how ASFV spreads in Vietnamese pig populations and suggest a protective vaccine coverage level required to prevent future outbreaks. The outbreak data were collected from ten private small-scale farms within the first wave of ASF outbreaks in Vietnam. Three methods were used to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), including the exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method, and attack rate method. The average R0 values were estimated at 1.49 (95%CI: 1.05-2.21), 1.58 (95%CI: 0.92-2.56), and 1.46 (95%CI: 1.38-1.57), respectively. Based on the worst-case scenario, all pigs in a herd would be infected and removed within 50 days. We suggest vaccinating at least 80% of pigs on each farm once a commercially approved ASF vaccine is available. However, an improvement in biosecurity levels in small-scale farms is still greatly encouraged to prevent the introduction of the virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dogs with MMVD commonly show clinical signs of dyspnea due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE). Reticulocytosis in the absence of anemia (RAA) is a hematological finding in hypoxic conditions. We aimed to assess the prevalence of RAA in dogs with CPE due to MMVD, and evaluate whether RAA is reversible with amelioration of dyspnea. Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with CPE due to MMVD were included. Dogs who died within 6 weeks of the onset of CPE were included in the non-survival group, while the others comprised the survival group. Of the 21 dogs, RAA was observed in 17 dogs (80.9%). In the RAA group, the absolute reticulocyte count significantly decreased as CPE resolved (p &lt; 0.001). The mean absolute reticulocyte count in the RAA group was 163.90 &#177; 50.77 on the first measurement and 78.84 &#177; 25.64 after resolution of CPE. In the RAA group, no significant differences in mean absolute reticulocyte count were observed between the survival and non-survival groups at either the first or second measurement. Our results indicate that RAA occurs in dogs with MMVD-related CPE and can resolve after resolution of CPE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two hundred and forty Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows (120 cows of each breed) were used in this study. The investigated dairy cows in each breed were allocated into two equal-sized groups (60 cows each); mastitis tolerant and affected groups. PCR-DNA sequencing of SELL, ABCG2, SLC11A1, FEZL, SOD1, CAT, GPX1, and AhpC/TSA revealed nucleotide sequence variations in the form of SNPs associated with mastitis tolerance/susceptibility in investigated Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows. Levels of SELL, SLC11A1 and FEZL gene expression were significantly up-regulated in mastitic Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows than in tolerant ones. Meanwhile, ABCG2, SOD1, CAT, GPX1, and AhpC/TSA genes were significantly downregulated. Regarding the economic parameters, significant differences were recorded for net returns and a reduction in the percentage of net profit, as the higher values of net returns were recorded for tolerant dairy cows than mastitic ones in both breeds; moreover, the net profit was reduced by 39% and 27% in mastitic Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows, respectively, when compared to tolerant ones. The results herein confirmed the potential significance of investigated genes as candidates for mastitis tolerance/susceptibility in Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows. Mastitis also has detrimental impacts on economic efficiency in dairy farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35737347</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>IL-1R8 as Pathoimmunological Marker for Severity of Canine Chronic Enteropathy.</Title>	<Abstract>Chronic enteropathy (CE) is a severe multifactorial gastrointestinal disease that affects dogs and is driven by poorly characterized inflammatory pathways. Imbalance of pro-inflammatory response regulators, including IL-1R8, may be due to different factors, among which the infection with Helicobacteraceae is known to lead to a vicious circle in which excessive pro-inflammatory signaling and gastrointestinal injury reinforce each other and boost the disease. We investigated the expression of IL-1R8 in large intestine biopsies of dogs with or without clinical signs of CE and with previously assessed enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. colonization status by mean of quantitative real-time PCR. Our study revealed that IL-1R8 is downregulated in both acutely (p = 0.0074) and chronically (p = 0.0159) CE affected dogs compared to healthy controls. The data also showed that IL-1R8 expression tends to decrease with colonization by Helicobacter spp. Interestingly, a negative correlation was detected between the level of expression of IL-1R8 and the severity of macroscopic lesions identified by endoscopy and the crypt hyperplasia score. We further compared the expression levels between males and females and found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. No significant difference was observed in IL-1R8 expression profiles with the age of the animals either. Interestingly, an association was uncovered between IL-1R8 expression level and dog breed. Together, our data advance knowledge on gastrointestinal pathoimmunology in dogs and highlight the potential utilization of IL-1R8 as a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarker for canine chronic enteropathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different reports have shown that all neurotrophin/receptor pathways can also play a role in several non-neuronal tissues in vertebrates, including the kidney. These signaling pathways are involved in different events to ensure the correct functioning of the kidney, such as growth, differentiation, and regulation of renal tubule transport. Previous studies in some fish species have identified the neurotrophins and receptors in the kidney. In this study, for the first time, we compare the expression profiles (mRNA and protein) of all neurotrophin/receptor pathways in the kidney of the adult zebrafish. We quantify the levels of mRNA by using qPCR and identify the expression pattern of each neurotrophin/receptor pathway by in situ hybridization. Next, we detect the proteins using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Our results show that among all neurotrophins analyzed, NT-3/TrkC is the most expressed in the glomerule and tubule and in the hematopoietic cells, similar to what has been reported in the mammalian kidney.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35737349</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Equine Chronic Tendon Lesions in Low- and High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</Title>	<Abstract>In equine medicine, experience regarding MRI of chronic tendon lesions is limited, and evidence on the suitability of different sequences in 3 T high-field MRI is scarce. Therefore, macroscopically healthy and altered tendons were examined by histology and in 0.27 T low- and 3 T high-field MRI, focusing on T1-weighted (T1w) sequences to visualize chronic lesions. In high-field MRI, tendons were positioned parallel (horizontal) and perpendicular (vertical) to the magnetic field, acknowledging the possible impact of the magic angle effect. The images were evaluated qualitatively and signal intensities were measured for quantitative analysis. Qualitative evaluation was consistent with the quantitative results, yet there were differences in lesion detection between the sequences. The low-field T1w GRE sequence and high-field T1w FLASH sequence with vertically positioned tendons displayed all tendon lesions. However, the horizontally scanned high-field T1w SE sequence failed to detect chronic tendon lesions. The agreement regarding tendon signal intensities was higher between high-field sequences scanned in the same orientation (horizontal or vertical) than between the same types of sequence (SE or FLASH), demonstrating the impact of tendon positioning. Vertical scanning was superior for diagnosis of the tendon lesions, suggesting that the magic angle effect plays a major role in detecting chronic tendon disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, this parasite was recently detected in honey bee colonies in Spain, raising the question as to whether bees can act as true hosts for this species. To address this issue, worker bees were experimentally infected with choanomastigotes from the early stationary growth phase and after 12 days, their hindgut was extracted for analysis by light microscopy and TEM. Although no cellular lesions were observed in the honey bee's tissue, trypanosomatids had differentiated and adopted a haptomonad morphology, transforming their flagella into an attachment pad. This structure allows the protozoa to remain attached to the gut walls via hemidesmosomes-such as junctions. The impact of this species on honey bee health, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms involved, remains unknown. Nevertheless, these results suggest that insect trypanosomatids may have a broader range of hosts than initially thought.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated staphylococci in cases of canine superficial pyoderma. The number of Staphylococcus strains to exhibit primary resistance to various drugs in vitro is increasing. Propolis has a diverse chemical composition and well-known therapeutic properties against bacterial infections. The current investigation evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of the commercial allopathic antimicrobials, Romanian propolis ethanolic extracts, against clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from superficial dermatitis clinical samples in dogs and two reference strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300, as the MSSA and MRSA positive controls, respectively, in western Romania. We used the microdilution broth technique to evaluate the susceptibility profile of the bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the Romanian propolis ethanolic extract ranged from 6 to 10 &#956;g/mL for all isolates, determined by the broth microdilution method. The MICs of ethanolic Romanian propolis extracts had a pronounced antibacterial activity. These results indicate that propolis can potentially be used and recommended for in vivo experiments as a promising therapeutic agent against Staphylococcus aureus infections in superficial dermatitis of dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Social benefits to owners such as decreasing feelings of loneliness and anxiety are provided by pets which are also used in Animal-assisted Therapy (AAT). Nevertheless, human-animal interactions are also associated with health problems including allergies, asthma, and zoonosis. Rabbits may carry potential pathogens for humans. One of the most common bacteria that colonizes the oro-pharynx and the upper respiratory tract of rabbits is Pasteurella (P.) multocida. Transmission of the infection to humans results from scratches, licks, and bites but it also can occur from the inhalation of air particles containing the microorganism. Immunocompromised people or persons with pulmonary disorders are particularly susceptible to the infection. Infected rabbits may carry P. multocida with or without clinical signs. In this paper, the sensitivity to antibiotics and the invasiveness ability of P. multocida identified in a farm of pet rabbits affected by severe pasteurellosis were investigated. The strain was P. multocida belonging to capsular type A which is the type most often detected in humans. The identified strain was susceptible to the tested antibiotics, but it appeared equipped with several virulence genes which are responsible for fimbriae production, adhesion processes to host cells, enzyme production, and are involved in iron acquisition processes. These findings are of particular interest because rabbits recovered from pasteurellosis very often become carriers of the bacteria. Therefore, we suggest considering P. multocida screening in the routine medical checks of rabbits, especially if they are meant to be companion animals for children and elder people, given that the transmission of the pathogen cannot be excluded.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At farrowing, 60 sows were assigned to three groups: the low-backfat-thickness group (LBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 9 and 12 mm; the medium-backfat-thickness group (MBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 13 and 20 mm; and the high-backfat-thickness group (HBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 21 and 25 mm. Maternal and fetal blood and placental samples were collected. Compared with the LBF and HBF groups, the MBF group delivered a significantly greater number of live piglets than the LBF or HBF groups. The different backfat thicknesses of sows had different effects on the lipid-related hormones and adipokines of maternal and fetal serum and placenta. Sows with poor or excessive backfat displayed higher levels of oxidative stress and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. According to these data, the thickness of a sow's backfat affects the characteristics of farrowing piglets and their lipid metabolism, as well as placental inflammation, maternal inflammation, and oxidative stress. A moderate backfat thickness (between 13 and 20 mm) was associated with greater reproductive performance in sows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has good sensitivity but tends to give false positive results. In this study, we standardized the application of the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) for the detection of antibodies against B.melitensis in goat milk. We obtained negative serum and milk samples from healthy goat flocks in the northern zone of Nuevo Le&#243;n. Positive milk and negative, weak, and strong controls were obtained by mixing volumes of positive control serum with negative control milk. Milk samples were treated with citric acid, after which an FPA was performed. Results were then compared with the Rose Bengal test and the FPA in serum. Milk treatment allowed the quantification of antibodies in samples. Significant differences were found between the 2%, 4%, and 6% groups, compared with the control group (F3, 67 = 17.45, p &lt; 0.0001) but not between the 2% and 4% groups (p = 0.0718). The cut-off value was 74.1 mP, with a sensitivity (Se) of 95% and a specificity (Sp) of 100%. Se and Sp values in field milk samples were 84% and 74.55%, respectively. Despite the FPA test on milk samples showed lower Se and Sp than the FPA test on serum samples, its cutoff may be adjusted. It may be recommended as a screening test in goat milk and become useful for the control and eradication of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35737356</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Urinary Cytology: Potential Role in Canine Urinary Tract Infections.</Title>	<Abstract>The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) requires a concomitant evaluation of clinical signs and urine culture, which is of fundamental to start an appropriate antibiotic treatment. Several factors, such as subclinical bacteriuria or pre-analytical errors, may make the interpretation of urine culture difficult. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between the finding of neutrophils and bacteria in unstained and stained canine urine sediment and the presence of clinical signs and positive urine culture. Urine samples from 35 dogs with clinical signs of UTI and 55 asymptomatic dogs with risk factors for UTI were prospectively collected by cystocentesis, divided into three aliquots, and submitted for: (1) physical and chemical Dipstick analysis and unstained urinary sediment (casts, crystals, bacteria, leucocytes, cells, parasites); (2) stained urinary sediment (extra/intracellular bacteria, degenerated and non-degenerated neutrophils); (3) qualitative and quantitative urine culture and antimicrobial sensitivity-test. The association between unstained and stained findings of urinary sediment and urine culture was tested. Sensibility, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values in diagnosing positive urine cultures of bacteria at unstained and stained evaluation were compared. Both wet-mount bacteriuria and the cytological presence of intracellular and extracellular bacteria, neutrophils, and degenerated neutrophils were successively associated with positive urine culture (p &lt; 0.001). The presence of intracellular bacteria was the only independent predictor of positive urine culture. Total bacterial count did not differ significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. Detection of extracellular and intracellular bacteriuria at stained urinary sediment significantly improved the sensibility of predicting positive urine culture. Cytologic evaluation of urinary sediment may be helpful in detecting signs of active inflammation, thus enhancing the clinical relevance of a positive urine culture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Canine leishmaniosis is an endemic disease in the Mediterranean region. The immune response could vary between hosts and determines the severity of the disease and clinical features. The aim of this study was to analyze the serum levels of cytokines TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8, which are related to the activation of Th1 or Th2 immune responses in dogs living in the L. infantum endemic region. Moreover, we intend to relate and correlate these levels with different factors, such as sex, age, diet, lifestyle, and breed. Epidemiological data and serum were recovered for seventy-eight dogs, and serum levels of cytokines described previously were analyzed by using the ELISA method. The results showed differences in serum levels of IFN-&#947;, IL-2, and IL-8 between breeds. The lifestyle also affected serum levels of IL-2. The main conclusion of this study is that Ibizan hounds and crossbred dogs have a serological profile of cytokines that seems to indicate certain protections against infection by L. infantum compared to boxer and purebred breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878323</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Risk Factors for Antimicrobial Resistance of Staphylococcus Species Isolated from Dogs with Superficial Pyoderma and Their Owners.</Title>	<Abstract>The microbial communities on the skin of dogs include several species of bacteria, which contribute to skin health and disease. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, cultured at high frequency from the skin of dogs, is an opportunistic pathogen causing superficial pyoderma. Effective treatment against S. pseudintermedius infections is an important issue in veterinary medicine. However, multiple antibiotic-resistant mechanisms gradually developed by bacteria make treatment more challenging nowadays. Drug-resistant genes may have the chance to be transferred from infected dogs to other staphylococci in humans. The objective of this survey is to investigate the bacterial species that cause canine superficial pyoderma and characterize the antibiotic-resistant profiles and drug-resistant genes of isolated S. pseudintermedius. In addition, the possible risk factors causing S. pseudintermedius colonizing owners were also evaluated by a questionnaire survey. Sixty-five bacteria were isolated from dogs with superficial pyoderma, which included 47 S. pseudintermedius (72.3%), 12 other staphylococci (18.5%), 4 other Gram-positive bacteria (6.2%) and 2 Gram-negative bacteria (3.1%). Strains containing mecA and blaZ genes showed multiple-drug resistance characteristics. Dogs that received antimicrobial treatment within a recent month were at significantly higher risk of MRSP infections. Only five S. pseudintermedius strains (8.33%) were isolated from 60 samples of owners. Risk factor analysis indicated there was no significant association between S. pseudintermedius isolated from dogs and owners, but the "Keeping three or more dogs" and "Dogs can lick the owner's face" have high odds ratios of 3.503 and 5.712, respectively. MRSP isolates belonged to three different dru types, including dt11y (29.41%), dt11a (47.06%) and dt10cp (23.53%). In conclusion, the major pathogen of canine superficial pyoderma is found to be S. pseudintermedius in Taiwan, and isolates which are mecA- or blaZ-positive are generally more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Although S. pseudintermedius isolated from the owners might be transferred from their dogs, definite risk factors should be examined in the future study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A study was conducted to investigate Salmonella contamination in major commercial feed mills that produce rations for broiler chickens within Great Britain. Dust and large moist gauze swab samples (12,791) were collected from 22 feed mills on 31 visits. Salmonella was isolated from 20 mills, with 15 mills (75%) having fewer than 5% Salmonella-positive samples. Fifty-one Salmonella serovars were isolated, with a large proportion of isolates being Salmonella (S.) Kedougou (29.4%) or S. 13,23:i:- (21.4%). European Union-regulated Salmonella serovars (Enteritidis, Infantis, Typhimurium and its monophasic variants) were isolated from 12 mills, mostly from non-processing areas, accounting for 40 isolates (4.4% of all Salmonella-positive samples). Fifteen Salmonella serovars were only isolated once. In terms of individual sampling locations within the mill, the waste handling locations were significantly more likely to be Salmonella-positive than some other mill locations. When sampling locations were grouped, samples collected from finished product areas were significantly less likely to be Salmonella-positive for Salmonella than some other mill areas. In conclusion, this study found that most mills producing broiler rations showed low-level Salmonella contamination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining ultrasonographical measurements of CVC and Ao in two different views, assess intra- and interobserver variability, and study the effect of sex, age, body weight, and breed on measurements in healthy calves. The diameter and area of CVC and Ao were measured by a single investigator in two anatomic sites (subxiphoid and paralumbar window) in 48 calves aged less than 60 days and then repeated 2.5 months after the first assessment. For intra- and interobserver variability assessment, CVC and Ao measurements were repeated by three observers on five randomly selected calves. CVC and Ao measurements were easily obtained in PV and more difficult to obtain in SV. CVC and Ao area in PV showed high repeatability and reproducibility. A positive correlation was highlighted between age and CVC and Ao measurements in both sites. In conclusion, CVC size assessment by point of care ultrasound can be easily performed at a paralumbar site in calves under 4 months of age and could be used to assess intravascular volume status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Melatonin exerts beneficial actions mainly via binding with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), termed MT1 and MT2. Melatonin receptors are crucial for mediating animal reproduction. This paper reviews the characteristics of melatonin receptors including MT1 and MT2, as well as their roles in mediating signal transduction and biological effects, with a focus on their function in animal reproduction. In addition, we briefly summarize the developments in pharmacological research regarding melatonin receptors as drug targets. It is expected that this review will provide a reference for further exploration and unveiling of melatonin receptor function in reproductive regulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fourteen consecutive dogs, with traumatic humeral Y-T fractures, met the inclusion criteria. This study includes signalment, preoperative radiographs, type of implants, radiographic bone healing assessment, complications, range of motion (ROM) of the elbow and limb function evaluated at 120 days after surgery. Postoperative radiographs revealed adequate anatomic reconstruction, and in all cases, bone healing has been achieved. No implant failure was observed. Functional outcome was excellent in 7 dogs (no lameness and preserved ROM), good in 4 (slight lameness and moderate ROM reduction) and discrete in 2 (mild lameness and severe ROM reduction). Complications were encountered in 2/14 patients with implant-associated infection resolved after long-term antibiotic treatment and implant removal. The PAX system is shown to be a valid alternative for the treatment of Y-T humeral fractures, offering the benefit of polyaxial insertion of locking screws. The possibility of angle locking screws is helpful in the distal humeral bicondylar fractures, providing additional options for screw placement in juxtarticular fractures, avoiding fracture lines or other implants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The assay performance characteristics were evaluated using a panel of positive (n = 36) and negative (n = 80) samples with known infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) status. The assay showed adequate repeatability (within-run and between-run), with a coefficient of variability (CV%) of replicates below 30%; only two 1:40 diluted samples had a CV% above 20%. Additionally, an agreement analysis of the qualitative results of replicates led to a Gwet&#8217;s agreement coefficient of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96&#8722;1.00, p &lt; 0.001). The estimated diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and diagnostic specificity (DSp) were 100% (95% CI: 90.3&#8722;100%) and 97.5% (95% CI: 91.3&#8722;99.7%), respectively. Overall, a good level of agreement was observed between the assay results and the true IBR status of samples (weighted Cohen&#8217;s &#954;: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78&#8722;1.00). The findings demonstrate that the indirect ELISA kit validated here is an easy-to-use and economical method to differentiate infected and gE-deleted marker vaccine-immunised animals using BM samples.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878329</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Zebrafish: A Model to Study and Understand the Diabetic Nephropathy and Other Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</Title>	<Abstract>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complicated metabolic illness that has had a worldwide impact and placed an unsustainable load on both developed and developing countries' health care systems. According to the International Diabetes Federation, roughly 537 million individuals had diabetes in 2021, with type 2 diabetes mellitus accounting for the majority of cases (T2DM). T2DM is a chronic illness defined by insufficient insulin production from pancreatic islet cells. T2DM generates various micro and macrovascular problems, with diabetic nephropathy (DN) being one of the most serious microvascular consequences, and which can lead to end-stage renal disease. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has set the way for its future as a disease model organism. As numerous essential developmental processes, such as glucose metabolism and reactive metabolite production pathways, have been identified in zebrafish that are comparable to those seen in humans, it is a good model for studying diabetes and its consequences. It also has many benefits over other vertebrate models, including the permeability of its embryos to small compounds, disease-driven therapeutic target selection, in vivo validation, and deconstruction of biological networks. The organism can also be utilized to investigate and understand the genetic abnormalities linked to the onset of diabetes problems. Zebrafish may be used to examine and visualize the growth, morphology, and function of organs under normal physiological and diabetic settings. The zebrafish has become one of the most useful models for studying DN, especially when combined with genetic alterations and/or mutant or transgenic fish lines. The significant advancements of CRISPR and next-generation sequencing technology for disease modelling in zebrafish, as well as developments in molecular and nano technologies, have advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of several human diseases, including DN. In this review, we emphasize the physiological and pathological processes relating to microvascular problems in zebrafish, as well as the many experimental zebrafish models used to research DN, and the DN-related outcomes and mechanisms observed in zebrafish.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty healthy cats were recruited and randomly allocated to the control (G1; n = 20) and treatment groups (G2; n = 20). The cats were treated with mouth spray twice daily for 42 days. The changes in the gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were measured at baseline (day 0) and end of the study (42nd day). The changes in the oral microbial composition of representative animals (control, n = 9; and treatment, n = 8) were also evaluated at baseline and end of the study. Oral microbial composition was assessed by amplifying the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from supragingival dental plaque DNA extracts. The sequences were annotated using the QIIME 2.0. The GI and PI were significantly reduced after 42 days of treatment. The deep sequencing revealed that mouth spray influenced the cats' oral microbiome and was significantly diverse. About 20 phyla and 59 species were observed after 42 days of mouth spray usage in cats' oral microbiota. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of post-treatment samples (PoTS) of G2 was greatly reduced compared to other samples. Further analysis revealed that mouth spray acts substantially against Desulfomicrobium orale, one of the known pathogens in periodontal disease. The mouth spray efficiently reduced the growth of 22 species and uprooted 17 species. Moreover, the mouth spray supported the growth of normal oral microbiota, including Moraxella and Neisseria species. The preliminary study suggested that the gallic acids-containing mouth spray could be an essential oral product to improve the oral hygiene of the cats. Moreover, further studies are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of mouth spray on cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals were fed a basal diet and BBC supplemented at 0, 3 or 6 g/kg of dry matter (DM). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design by a group of animals with six replicates. The intake and digestibility among treatments were not different (p &gt; 0.05). The average daily gain (ADG) of steers that received BBC at 6 g/kg of DM (0.79 kg/day) tended to be higher (p = 0.07) than that of those receiving BBC at 0 and 3 g/kg/day (0.52 and 0.63 kg/day, respectively). Blood metabolites were not different (p &gt; 0.05) among treatments. Carcass characteristic traits included chilled carcass dressing percentage and loin eye area, while meat quality included drip loss, cooking loss, and Warner-Bratzler shear force were not different (p &gt; 0.05). Back fat thickness tended to be higher (p = 0.07) in steers fed BBC at 6 g/kg.

On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a mass involving the right epaxial muscles with vertebral canal invasion and causing marked extradural spinal cord compression was identified. At surgery, the mass was debulked and a right hemilaminectomy was performed. Histopathology was diagnostic of fibroblastic osteosarcoma. Residual osteolytic lesions of the osteosarcoma were present at the level of the spinous process of the second lumbar vertebra. Four cycles of adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy were administered followed by oral toceranib phosphate. Neurological signs improved gradually over weeks to months and the lesion in the spinous process was no longer visible on radiographs. At one year from diagnosis, an MRI of the T3-L3 (3rd thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra) spinal region and a whole-body computer tomography (CT) scan found no evidence of the osteosarcoma in the spine or of any metastasis. All medications were stopped and, at the time of writing 16 months later, the patient is neurologically normal with no signs of cancer recurrence. This is the first case report documenting the complete resolution of vertebral osteosarcoma lesions after treatment with doxorubicin followed by toceranib phosphate. The treatment also prevented tumor recurrence and was associated with an exceptionally long-term survival time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to use primary cultured broiler hepatocytes to establish a steatosis model to explore the optimal conditions for inducing steatosis by incubating the cells with a fat emulsion. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from an AA broiler by a modified two-step in situ perfusion method. Hepatocytes were divided into an untreated control group and a fat emulsion group that was incubated with 2.5, 5, 10, or 20% fat emulsion for different times to determine the optimal conditions for inducing steatosis of primary hepatocytes. Incubation of the cells with 10% fat emulsion resulted in cell viability at 48 h of 67%, which was higher than the control group and met the requirements of the model. In the second experiment, steatosis was induced by incubating hepatocytes with 10% fat emulsion for 48 h. In consequence, the apoptosis rate decreased (p &gt; 0.05) and the concentration of ALT (p &lt; 0.001), AST (p &lt; 0.01), and TG (p &lt; 0.05) increased significantly; the expression level of SREBP-1c (p &lt; 0.05) increased, and the expression levels of PPAR&#945; (p &lt; 0.001), CPT1 (p &lt; 0.001), and CPT2 (p &lt; 0.05) were lower in the fat emulsion group than in the control group.

In particular, treating infections caused by staphylococci with acquired antimicrobial resistance is problematic, as their treatment is more difficult. The resistance is found both in human and animal staphylococcal strains. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) have also been increasingly reported in wildlife. In Arab countries, MRS has been detected in food producing animals and food products; however, the risk this poses is somewhat unclear, and still a significant lack of information on the trend and distribution of these pathogens in these countries, which have a specific ecosystem (desert) and traditions (Muslim culture). In this manuscript, we aim to provide an overview of the prevalence and the major MRS clonal lineages circulating in these specific countries and compare to them other situations with different ecosystems and cultures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The majority of cases involve an autoimmune attack against AChR, but a limited number of patients are seronegative for AChR antibodies. Viral infection is incriminated as a trigger for MG occurrence, and in a limited number of reports, infection with SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with MG expression in humans. In this report, we describe case of seronegative generalized MG in a 2-year-old crossbred female dog associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close exposure to an infected owner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878336</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Isolation, Molecular Characterization, and Antibiotic Resistance of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli in Eastern China.</Title>	<Abstract>Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis in avians, resulting in considerable losses in the poultry industry. APEC showed zoonotic potential initially related to the fact that APEC serves as the reservoir of virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes for other E. coli. Thus, we determine the serotypes, phylogenetic groups, virulence genes distribution, and antibiotic resistance profiles of APEC isolates in eastern China. A total of 230 APEC were isolated from diseased chicken and duck with typical colibacillosis symptoms. Serotyping identified that O78 (44.78%) was the predominant serotype. The majority of APEC isolates were classified into B2 (29.57%), A (26.96%), D (20.00%), and B1 (18.26%), respectively. Among the 15 virulence genes, a high prevalence of ibeB (99.57%), fimC (91.74%), mat (91.30%), ompA (83.04%), and iss (80.43%) genes was observed. Except for low resistance rates for imipenem (1.7%) and polymyxin B (0.4%), most of the APEC isolates were resistant to erythromycin (98.7%), enrofloxacin (96.1%), tetracycline (95.2%), doxycycline (93.9%), lincomycin (90.0%), and streptomycin (90.0%). Moreover, all APEC exhibit multi-drug resistance. This study indicated that APEC isolates harbor a variety of virulence genes and showed multi-antibiotic resistance profiles, providing proof for understanding the epidemiological background and zoonotic potential of APEC in poultry farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there may still exist isolated areas that remain free of N. ceranae. Herein, we used molecular tools to survey the Azores to detect N. ceranae and unravel its colonisation patterns. To that end, we sampled 474 colonies from eight islands in 2014/2015 and 91 from four islands in 2020. The findings revealed that N. ceranae was not only present but also the dominant species in the Azores. In 2014/2015, N. apis was rare and N. ceranae prevalence varied between 2.7% in S&#227;o Jorge and 50.7% in Pico. In 2020, N. ceranae prevalence increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) in Terceira and S&#227;o Jorge also showing higher infection levels. The spatiotemporal patterns suggest that N. ceranae colonised the archipelago recently, and it rapidly spread across other islands, where at least two independent introductions might have occurred. Flores and Santa Maria have escaped the N. ceranae invasion, and it is remarkable that Santa Maria is also free of Varroa destructor, which makes it one of the last places in Europe where the honey bee remains naive to these two major biotic stressors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878338</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effect of Green Tea on Weight Gain and Semen Quality of Rabbit Males.</Title>	<Abstract>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the action of the green tea plant (Camellia sinensis, L) on male rabbit reproduction and some non-reproductive indexes. Male rabbits were fed either a standard diet (control group) or a diet enriched with green tea powder (experimental groups; E): 5 g (E1) or 20 g (E2) per 100 kg of the milled complete feed mixture. Weight gain, sperm concentration, total and progressive motility, as well as haematological, and biochemical parameters and changes in testicular tissue histomorphology were evaluated. Feeding with green tea, at both tested concentrations, decreased weight gain per week and the total average weight gain compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, green tea decreased sperm concentration, motility and progressive motility in the group fed with a lower dose (5 g) of green tea powder (p &lt; 0.05), whilst a higher dose (20 g) was neutral. Some haematological and biochemical indexes, like medium-size cell count (MID), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet percentage (PCT), levels of phosphorus (P) and total proteins (TP) were decreased in one or both experimental groups (p &lt; 0.05), whilst the triglyceride level (TG) was increased in the E2 group (p &lt; 0.05). The thicknesses of the testicular seminiferous tubules and epithelial layer were not affected by any concentration of green tea powder (p &gt; 0.05). These observations suggest that green tea in the diet may have an adverse effect on rabbit growth and sperm quality, but their effect may be potentially dose-dependent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A neurological examination revealed severe neck pain and non-ambulatory tetraparesis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed hypoplastic dens with moderate compression of the spinal cord at C1-C2. The atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) was surgically stabilized using ventral pins and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. On the second postoperative day, the patient showed significant dyspnea, and aspiration pneumonia was identified on radiography. The patient exhibited dysphagia with abnormal food prehension and an inability to protrude the tongue, with no gag reflex. We tentatively diagnosed the patient with multiple cranial nerve (CN) palsies involving the 9th, 10th, and 12th CNs following surgical ventral stabilization. The protruding cranial part of the implanted PMMA cement, which could mechanically contribute to the corresponding CNs dysfunction, was surgically removed. The symptoms gradually improved, and the patient showed normal tongue movement 1 month after revision surgery. In conclusion, we report herein a canine case of multiple CN palsies following ventral stabilization surgery for AAS. The experience gained from this case suggests an optimized management plan for postoperative neurological complications associated with ventral stabilization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CAD patients also present an abnormal immune response with an altered expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as &#946;-defensins and cathelicidins. Sphingolipids and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been reported to improve the skin barrier in several animal species, including dogs. Our objective was to evaluate the in vitro effects of a sphingomyelin-rich lipid extract (LE), a hyaluronic acid-rich GAG matrix, and their combination, on the expression of filaggrin and human &#946;-defensin 2 (hBD-2). Filaggrin expression was quantified in a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), and hBD-2 in normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) cultures. LE and GAGs were tested at 0.02 mg/mL, with or without adding a cytokine mix. A significant increase in mean hBD-2, compared to the control (99 pg/mL) was achieved with LE (138 pg/mL) and LE+GAGs (165 pg/mL). Filaggrin increased with GAGs (202% &#177; 83) and LE (193% &#177; 44) vs. the stimulated control, but this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) only with LE+GAGs (210% &#177; 39). In conclusion, the tested GAGs and LE enhance filaggrin and AMP expression in vitro, which might benefit CAD patients if applied in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on microbiome and metabolome recovery is unknown. This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study included sixteen healthy purpose-bred dogs. All dogs received tylosin 20 mg/kg PO once daily (days 1-7) and were randomly assigned to either receive one FMT via enema (day 8), daily oral FMT capsules (days 8-21), or daily placebo capsules (days 8-21). Fecal samples were frozen at regular intervals until day 42. Quantitative PCR for 8 bacterial taxa was performed to calculate the fecal dysbiosis index (FDI) and fecal concentrations of unconjugated bile acids (UBA) were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Tylosin altered the abundance of most evaluated bacteria and induced a significant decrease in secondary bile acid concentrations at day 7 in all dogs. However, most parameters returned to their baseline by day 14 in all dogs. In conclusion, tylosin markedly impacted fecal microbiota and bile acid concentrations, although return to baseline values was quick after the antibiotic was discontinued. Overall, FMT did not accelerate recovery of measured parameters. Further studies are warranted to confirm the value of FMT in accelerating microbiota recovery in antibiotic-associated dysbiosis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, as previously described, individual and breed variability (body size and conformation) is related to breeding, body conformation, and size. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the influence of morphometric measures on the speed (V), peak of vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), and stance time (ST) in healthy dolichomorph and mesomorph dogs and their combined effect on and interactions with V, PVF, VI, and ST in the same morphological types. Fifty dogs were enrolled in the current study, and specific morphometric measurements were recorded for each dog. A force platform was used to record the ground reaction forces (GFRs), including PVF and VI. Multiple linear regression models were used for the study purposes. According to our results, GFRs are influenced by morphometric measures (body weight, withers height, and speed) not so much as a single contribution, but by the interaction between them. It is not possible to compare GFRs in dogs that do not belong to the same breed. However, the subjective variabilities make this comparison difficult and poorly reliable. According to the author, the comparison should be made between canine morphological types rather than breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878343</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Pro-Inflammatory and Immunological Profile of Dogs with Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is a very frequently acquired cardiac disease in dog breeds and is responsible for congestive heart failure (CHF). The involvement of the immune system and pro-inflammatory cytokines in dogs with CHF due to mitral valve disease has not yet been extensively investigated. Here, we investigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the dysfunction of the immune system in dogs with different stages of severity through the blood assessment of CD4[+]FoxP3[+]regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, interleukin (IL)-1&#946; and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines, and immunological and echocardiographic parameters. A total of 36 cardiopathic dogs, 14 females and 22 males, with MMVD were included. Mean age and body weight (BW) at the time of enrollment were 10.7 &#177; 2.77 years and 10.9 &#177; 6.69 kg, respectively. For the comparison of the pro-inflammatory and immunological parameters, two groups of healthy dogs were also established. Control group 1 consisted of young animals (n. 11; 6 females and 5 males), whose age and mean weight were 4.1 &#177; 0.82 years and 13.8 &#177; 4.30 kg, respectively. Control group 2 consisted of elderly dogs (n. 12; 6 females and 6 males), whose age and BW were 9.6 &#177; 0.98 years and 14.8 &#177; 6.15 kg, respectively. Of particular interest, an increase in Treg cells was observed in the cohort of MMVD dogs, as compared to the healthy dogs, as Treg cells are involved in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, and they are involved in etiopathogenetic and pathophysiological mechanisms in the dog. On the other hand, TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 significantly increased according to the severity of the disease in MMVD dogs. Furthermore, the positive correlation between IL-6 and the left ventricle diastolic volume suggests that inflammatory activation may be involved in cardiac remodeling associated with the progressive volumetric overload in MMVD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878344</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Safety and Efficacy of an Oncolytic Adenovirus as an Immunotherapy for Canine Cancer Patients.</Title>	<Abstract>The use of oncolytic viruses is an innovative approach to lyse tumor cells and induce antitumor immune responses. Eight dogs diagnosed with carcinoma/adenocarcinoma were intratumorally treated with ICOCAV15, an oncolytic canine adenovirus (CAV). To evaluate the treatment's safety, a blood count, biochemistry, and coagulation test were performed before treatment and during follow-up. Immune populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Anti-adenovirus antibodies were also determined. The immune infiltration, vascularization, and viral presence in the tumor were determined by CD3, CD4, CD20, CD31 and CAV by immunohistochemistry. All the dogs maintained a good quality of life during follow-up, and some had increased median survival time when compared with dogs treated with chemotherapy. No treatment-related adverse effects were detected. The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria were also assessed: two patients showed a partial response and the rest showed stable disease at various times during the study. ICOCAV15 was detected inside the tumor during follow-up, and antiviral antibodies were detected in all patients. Furthermore, the tumor-infiltrating immune cells increased after viral administration. Therefore, we suggest that intratumorally administered ICOCAV15 could represent as a new tool for the treatment of canine carcinoma because it is safe, well-tolerated by dogs, and shows promising results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We isolated and identified a total of 165 strains of Corynebacterium species from experimental mice in Korean laboratories, diagnosed using several methods. When identified based on molecular methods, namely, 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequence analysis, the main Corynebacterium species isolated in Korean laboratory mice were C. mastitidis (44.8%, n = 74), C. bovis (25.5%, n = 42), C. lowii (21.2%, n = 35), and C. amycolatum (8.5%, n = 14). Diagnoses were also performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and biochemical methods. MALDI-TOF MS yielded results that were 77.9% identical to the molecular identification results, whereas biochemical methods showed only 15.5% identical to molecular identification, partly owing to difficulties in distinguishing among C. mastitidis strains. Collectively, our findings indicate that molecular biological methods are better suited for detecting and identifying Corynebacterium species candidates isolated from mice than biochemical methods. Because of limitations associated with the use of MALDI-TOF MS, more precise results will be obtained by complementing this approach with other methods when used for rapid identification testing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878346</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Differences in Behavior between Normal and Atopic Keratinocytes in Culture: Pilot Studies.</Title>	<Abstract>Skin barrier dysfunction is important in atopic dermatitis and can be secondary to inflammation. Observation of keratinocytes in culture may show intrinsic differences. TransEpithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) measures epithelial permeability. We cultured normal and atopic keratinocytes and found that TEER of atopic keratinocytes was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) than that of normals. Atopic keratinocytes grew upwards, first creating isolated dome-like structures and later horizontally into a monolayer. At time of confluence (D0), atopic keratinocytes were more differentiated, with higher filaggrin gene expression than normals. No differences existed between groups for TJ proteins (claudin, occludin, and Zonula Occludens-1) on D0 and D6. On D6, claudin and occludin were higher than D0, in normal (p = 0.0296 and p = 0.0011) and atopic keratinocytes (p = 0.0348 and 0.0491). Immunofluorescent staining showed nuclear location of filaggrin on D0 and cytoplasmic on D6. ANOVA showed increased cell size from D0 to D6 in both groups (effect of time, p = 0.0076) but no differences between groups. Significant subject effect (p = 0.0022) was found, indicating that cell size was subject-dependent but not disease-dependent. No difference for continuity for TJ protein existed between groups. These observations suggest that decreased TEER in atopics is not linked to TJ differences but is possibly linked to different growth behavior.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This still poses a public health problem in Algeria and in many countries. In order to assess the epidemiological situation of certain diseases in the Taher region in Jijel and to determine the influence of certain variation factors and to estimate the risk on public health, a study was extended over a period of 14 months on a total of 1756 cattle slaughtered at the Taher slaughterhouse. The results showed that 609 cattle (34.68%) showed lesions. The highest rate of pathological findings was observed on the liver (37.27%) followed by the lungs (30.21%). The lowest rate was recorded on the digestive system (0.33%) followed by the kidneys (1.14%). In addition, the liver and lungs were more contaminated with hydatid cyst compared to other organs (20.69%, 19.05%, respectively). Our data showed that the diseases affected more females (55.82%) than males (44.17%) (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, cattle aged between 3 and 5 years were the most affected (43.51%) and local breed cattle showed more lesions (71.59%). These results testify to the real risk represented by the consumption of organs affected by diseases, and the need to recognize the agents of contamination and the mode of transmission and to implement an extension and control program in this region depending on the epidemiological aspect of the lesions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878348</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Essential and Non-Essential Amino Acids in Dogs at Different Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>Abnormalities of serum amino acid profile, mostly characterized by a reduction in essential amino acids (EAAs) and an increase in non-essential amino acids (NEAAs), have been documented in human chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Amino acid disorders have been associated with CKD complications, such as metabolic acidosis and malnutrition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate EAAs and NEAAs in dogs affected by CKD at different IRIS stages, with particular reference to calcium&#8722;phosphate abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, and protein-energy wasting syndrome (PEW). Serum EAAs (L-histidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-threonine, tryptophan, L-valine, and L-arginine) and serum NEAAs (L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, glycine, proline, L-serine, and L-tyrosine) were analyzed with HPLC in a group of dogs with CKD (n = 62), and in a group of healthy dogs (n = 25). CKD dogs showed significantly lower serum levels of histidine (p &lt; 0.000), isoleucine (p &lt; 0.000), tryptophan (p &lt; 0.000), alanine (p = 0.013), cysteine (p &lt; 0.000), and serine (p = 0.002), and significantly higher levels of proline (p &lt; 0.000), leucine (p = 0.001), lysine (p &lt; 0.000), valine (p &lt; 0.000), arginine (p = 0.002), glutamic acid (p = 0.002), and glycine (p = 0.010) compared to healthy dogs. Dogs with abnormal calcium x phosphate values showed significantly higher levels of cysteine (p = 0.003), and lower levels of tryptophan (p = 0.025) compared to CKD dogs with normal CaxP. Dogs with metabolic acidosis showed significantly higher levels of phenylalanine (p = 0.035) and leucine (p = 0.034) compared to CKD dogs without metabolic acidosis. Dogs with PEW showed significantly lower levels for most of amino acids. In PEW dogs, the median distribution of both EAAs (p = 0.000) and NEAAs (p = 0.001) was significantly lower. The serum pattern of both EAAs and NEAAs was significantly different in CKD dogs compared to healthy dogs, although no association with the progression of the IRIS stage was found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Metaplasia of the mucosal epithelial layer and mucous gland, as well as lymphocyte infiltration under the esophageal mucous gland and epithelial cell layer, were observed, which we found were caused by vitamin A deficiency. In one chicken, however, the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the esophagus were completely replaced by increased numbers of ducts/ductules, lymphocytes, and connective tissue, resulting in a papillary morphology. The ducts were surrounded by a fibrous stroma. Multiple hyperplasia of the esophageal gland was also observed and the esophageal glands were lined by a single layer of columnar cells, and a large number of lymphocytes were infiltrated into the submucosal layer. Based on the gross findings, this papillary proliferation was considered papilloma, but histopathologically, a mass composed of squamous epithelium was not observed. Therefore, the papillary lesion appeared as adenoma with squamous metaplasia of the esophageal gland and ectasia, or mucosal epithelial papillary hyperplasia, associated with chronic esophagitis. A metagenomic analysis of the esophagus samples from this chicken was performed to determine the infectious etiology. No viral cause was identified; however, a contributing role of Bradyrhizobium sp. could not be excluded. In this study, we report the first histopathological examination of a rare case of esophageal papillary proliferation in a chicken and highlight the importance of histopathological results for a definitive diagnosis of such cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to compare the genetic structure and genetic diversity of six paternal genealogical lineages of the Danubian horse breed (Zdravko, NONIUS XVII-30, Torpedo, Lider, Kalifa, and Hrabar). In total, 166 individuals from the six genealogical lines were investigated, based on 15 STR markers (short tandem repeats, also known as microsatellites). In total, 184 alleles were found in the six populations, using 15 microsatellite loci. The mean number of alleles, the effective number of alleles, and the polymorphic information content (PIC) values per locus were 12.28, 9.48, and 0.73, respectively. In a comparison of the allelic diversity among sire lineages, the highest genetic diversity (Na) was observed in Lider and Kalifa (14.60 &#177; 0.21), while the lowest value of this parameter was observed in the Zdravko lineage 4.20 &#177; 0.35. The largest genetic diversity was found in loci HMS3 and HMS7, with 13 alleles, and the smallest polymorphism was noted for the locus ASB17, with 10 alleles. The level of observed heterozygosity was in the range of 0.65 &#177; 0.069 for the Zdravko lineage to 0.93 &#177; 0.01 for the Torpedo lineage. The expected heterozygosity level range was from 0.57 &#177; 0.048 to 0.91 &#177; 0.01 for all horse lineages. Structure analysis revealed three main gene pools in the study population. The first pool included the Zdravko lineage; the second had the NONIUS XVII-30, Torpedo, Lider, and Kalifa lineages; and the third defined the Hrabar lineage, which was significantly differentiated from the other genealogical lineages.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878351</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Trephination versus Minimally Invasive Transnasal Approaches for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Sinus Disease in Horses.</Title>	<Abstract>This retrospective case series aims to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different treatment options for sinus disease in horses, with a special focus on surgical approaches. The medical records of 25 horses with sinusitis which presented to the equine hospital, Vetmeduni Vienna, between August 2020 and January 2022 were analysed. In 11 cases, conservative treatment by the transnasal endoscopic lavage of the affected sinuses through the sinonasal channel or through a developed, pre-existing sinonasal fistula was performed. In the remaining 14 cases, openings into the sinus for subsequent lavage were surgically created either via classical trephination/bone flaps (8) or by transnasal endoscopically guided minimally invasive approaches (8). In some cases (2), a combination of classical extra-nasal and minimally invasive transnasal approaches was required. The minimally invasive techniques used were comprised of laser surgery (3), electrosurgery (3) and balloon sinoplasty (2). The sinusitis and underlying diseases were successfully treated in all of the horses until hospital discharge. Long-term follow-up could be obtained only from a small number of patients due to the temporal proximity (the study began two years ago) to their initial discharge from the hospital, but they showed the continuous resolution of clinical signs in all cases in which follow up data were available. The results of this case series indicate that if surgical intervention is required, minimally invasive techniques appear to be a promising and potentially cheaper alternative to classical extra-nasal approaches for the treatment of sinus disease in selected cases. In the future, the use of these techniques should be considered more commonly with the broader availability of improved endoscopes and instruments. Additionally, by using small-diameter endoscopes, the need for any surgical intervention might be significantly reduced in many cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Oxidative stress is a leading cause of oocyte aging. This study investigated the effects of lycopene supplementation of in vitro maturation (IVM) medium during the aging of mouse oocytes on the oocytes' morphology and oxidative stress status. Mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected and cultured in the IVM medium either for 17 h, (freshly matured oocytes), or for 48 h, (in vitro-aged oocytes), with or without lycopene. The rate of fragmented and degenerated oocytes and the oocyte levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated and compared. Oocytes aged with 200 nM lycopene revealed significantly less fragmentation and degeneration, lower H2O2 and MDA levels, and higher TAC, GSH and SOD levels than those aged without lycopene. CAT levels were unchanged by lycopene treatment. Taken together, our data showed beneficial effects of lycopene during in vitro aging of mouse oocytes by reducing the oxidative stress damages that lead to their apoptosis. The present study introduces lycopene as a natural supplement to reduce the postovulatory aging-dependent abnormalities of mammalian oocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this study, 20 adult dogs were selected from patients of a physiotherapy referral center with orthopedic, neurological, and/or degenerative conditions. The severity of the medical problem was ranked, and the symptoms, the treatment plan, and demographic data were recorded at the time of the physical examination. In addition, the owner of the dog was asked to fill out a questionnaire on the quality of life of the pet (the Milan Pet Quality of Life scale) at the time of the first consultation as well as the last follow-up after the treatment. The MPQL measures four domains of QOL: physical (signs of medical conditions), psychological (emotional and behavioral well-being), social (quality and extent of social interactions), and environmental (freedom and safety in one's environment). The results of the study indicated a significant improvement in the psychological QOL domain following physiotherapeutic treatment. The social QOL domain declined with the severity of lameness, while the physical QOL, as reported by the owner, declined with the overall criticality of the medical condition, as ranked by the physiotherapist. The results of the study support the recent evidence of a relationship between pain and canine psychological well-being and highlight the importance of investigating psychological and emotional aspects of dogs' QOL when treating orthopedic and neurological cases with physiotherapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological aspects of various populations of cats infected with Bartonella spp. or haemoplasma species. The populations evaluated included client-owned cats, stray cats and cats that live in breeding catteries in Greece. A total of 452 cats were prospectively enrolled into the study. A commercially available indirect immunofluorescence antibody testkit was used for the detection of Bartonella henselae IgG antibodies in serum. PCRs for the detection of Bartonella spp. and haemoplasma species DNA in the blood were also performed in a subgroup of 242 of the 452 cats. Risk factors for B. henselae seropositivity and infection with the haemoplasma species were determined using multivariable analysis. Overall, 160 (35.4%) of the 452 cats were seropositive for B. henselae. Seven (2.9%) and 46 (19%) of the 242 cats were PCR-positive for Bartonella spp. and haemoplasma species, respectively. The factors associated with B. henselae seropositivity, based on multivariate analysis, included older age, outdoor access, living region and flea infestation. Non-administration of ectoparasiticides was associated with haemoplasma species infection. This study shows a high prevalence of seropositivity for B. henselae and a relatively high prevalence of infection with haemoplasma species. Therefore, it is necessary to establish optimal strategies for the prevention of Bartonella spp. and haemoplasma species infections, considering the high-risk groups of cats identified in this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, diagnosis is complicated in endemically infected swine herds presenting no obvious clinical signs. This study aimed to investigate the right time point for sampling to detect swIAV. A cross-sectional study was performed in 131 farms from 12 European countries. The sampling protocol included suckling piglets, weaners, and nursery pigs. In each age group, 10 nasal swabs were collected and further examined in pools of 5 for swIAV by Matrix rRT-PCR, followed by a multiplex RT-PCR to determine the influenza subtype. SwIAV was detected in 284 (37.9%) of the samples and on 103 (78.6%) farms. Despite the highest number of animals with clinical signs being found in the nursery, the weaners were significantly more often virus-positive compared to nursery pigs (p = 0.048). Overall, the swIAV detection rate did not significantly differ between diseased or non-diseased suckling and nursery piglets, respectively; however, diseased weaners had significantly more positive pools than the non-diseased animals. Interestingly, in 9 farms, different subtypes were detected in different age groups. Our findings indicate that to detect all circulating swIAV subtypes on a farm, different age groups should be sampled. Additionally, the sampling strategy should also aim to include non-diseased animals, especially in the suckling period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Macroscopic examination revealed an enlarged spleen and liver with the hepatic and splenic parenchyma showing extensive infiltration with firm, white to cream-coloured nodules. The uterus showed a few small, firm, well-demarcated, white-to-cream-coloured nodules in the uterine body. Similar nodules were present in the mediastinum, parietal pleura, heart, and marrow cavity of the femur. Histological analysis of the uterus revealed densely cellular neoplastic proliferations, forming nests, tubules, and acini within an abundant fibrovascular stroma. The samples from the other tissues revealed neoplastic cells with a similar appearance to those seen in the uterus, also forming nests and acini in a fibrovascular stroma. Importantly, multiple neoplastic cells were also seen in the peribronchiolar lymphatic vessels. The neoplastic cells in the uterine sections showed positive immunohistochemical labelling for cytokeratin, as did the neoplastic cells in the sections of liver and parietal pleura, confirming they were of epithelial origin. In addition, transmission electron microscopy of the uterus and liver showed neoplastic cells arranged in groups surrounded by basement membranes and interspersed with collagen fibres. Junctions were present between the cells, and junctional complexes could be seen at some cell surfaces. This confirmed that the neoplastic cells seen in the liver sample were the same as those seen in the uterine sample and were of epithelial origin. Thus, a diagnosis was made of uterine adenocarcinoma with widespread metastasis. This is the first report of uterine adenocarcinoma in a sable antelope.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In animals, cutaneous progressive angiomatosis (CPA) is a disorder with variable prognosis related to the extension and depth of infiltration of the surrounding tissues by vessels. CPA may share some microscopical features with other vascular proliferations such as low-grade well-differentiated capillaritic hemangiosarcoma (HS), making the diagnosis not always straightforward, especially in small biopsies. The aim of this study is to retrospectively assess the most common diagnostic microscopical features of CPA in dogs. In this work, 11 histopathological criteria were analyzed on 31 CPA and 11 primary cutaneous HS in dogs. Features significantly associated with CPA included: lobular growth, interposition of connective tissue and adnexa between the vascular proliferation, presence of nerve fibers, and a mixed vascular proliferative component. Absence of plump/prominent endothelial cells, lack of atypia, and lack of mitoses were also significant factors differentiating CPA from HS. Additional distinctive findings in CPA, although with no statistical association to CPA diagnosis, were vascular shunting, absence of necrosis, and endothelial cell piling up. In conclusion, the combined use of different microscopical clues allowed for the distinction of CPA from HS and was considered useful for the diagnosis of CPA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878358</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Microscopical Evaluation of Smears of the Leptomeninges to Predict Meningitis in Piglets.</Title>	<Abstract>Meningitis, caused by bacterial infections such as Streptococcus spp., is a frequently observed cause of death in pigs. In order to implement effective treatment and avoid further losses, it is important to establish this diagnosis quickly. However, this is often difficult because macroscopic lesions may not be visible, and additional laboratory testing may take several days. The present study investigated whether microscopical examination of impression smears of the leptomeninges taken during necropsy can help in establishing a presumptive diagnosis of meningitis in pigs more quickly. In total, 54 pigs suffering from neurological signs and/or (acute) mortality were examined. They were 3 to 10 weeks old and originated from 16 farms. From each pig, bacterial culture was performed on one half of the brain using a swab from the leptomeninges. From the other half, paired cytological impression smears of the leptomeninges were stained with a commercial quick stain dye (Hemacolor[&#174;]) and Gram stain and microscopically evaluated for the abundance of neutrophils and the presence of short-chain coccoid bacteria. Bacterial culture of the leptomeninges was positive in 36/54 cases, in 28 of which Streptococcus spp. were found. The numbers of smears with low, moderate, or high abundance of neutrophils were 19, 17, and 18, respectively. Short-chain coccoid bacteria were detected successfully in 12 pigs in the Gram-stained smear. The positive predictive value of smears with moderate or high abundance of neutrophils for bacterial presence and, therefore, likely meningitis was 89%, whereas the negative predictive value of smears with low abundance of neutrophils was 74%. The positive predictive value of smears with short chains of coccoid bacteria for diagnosis of Streptococcus spp. was 100%, whereas the negative predictive value was 62%. In conclusion, microscopical examination of impression smears of the leptomeninges of piglets with neurological signs and/or (acute) mortality is a feasible procedure that can help swine practitioners in establishing a tentative diagnosis of meningitis more quickly, especially if neutrophils are abundant, and short chains of coccoid bacteria are present.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, little is known about the role of HPS_06257 in the protective immune response. A whole-genome data analysis showed that among 18 isolates of Glaesserella parasuis, 11 were positive for the HPS_06257 gene, suggesting that not every strain contains this gene. We used PCR to investigate the presence of the HPS_06257 gene among 13 reference strains and demonstrated that 5 strains contained the gene. A polyclonal antibody against HPS_06257 was generated with a recombinant protein to study the expression of HPS_06257 in those 13 strains. Consistent with the PCR data, five strains expressed HPS_06257, whereas eight strains were HPS_06257 null. We also compared the protective effects of HPS_06257 against an HPS_06257-expressing strain (HPS5) and an HPS_06257-null strain (HPS11). Immunization with HPS_06257 only protected against HPS5 and not HPS11. Moreover, phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized bacteria demonstrates that the antibody against HPS_06257 increased the phagocytosis of the HPS5 strain by macrophages but not the phagocytosis of the HPS11 strain, suggesting that antibody-dependent phagocytosis is responsible for the protective role exerted by HPS_06257 in the immune response to HPS5. Our data also show that the antibody against HPS_06257 increased the phagocytosis of the other HPS_06257-expressing strains by macrophages but not that of HPS_06257-null strains. In summary, our findings demonstrate that antibody-dependent phagocytosis contributes to the protective immune response induced by immunization with HPS_06257 against HPS_06257-expressing strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Spotted fevers caused by Rickettsiae may cause non-specific symptoms, which make clinical diagnosis difficult. The aim of the current study was to evaluate and review the diversity of SFG Rickettsiae in ticks collected in 41 counties in Romania. A total of 2028 questing and engorged ticks collected in Romania belonging to five species were tested by PCR amplification of Rickettsia spp. gltA and 17-D gene fragments: Ixodes ricinus (n = 1128), Dermacentor marginatus (n = 507), D. reticulatus (n = 165), Rhipicephalus rossicus (n = 128) and Haemaphysalis punctata (n = 100). Five Rickettsia species were identified following DNA sequence analysis: R. helvetica, R. monacensis, R. slovaca, R. raoultii, and R. hoogstraalii. The most common species detected was R. monacensis. Moreover, R. hoogstraalii was detected for the first time in Romania and in R. rossicus ticks. The detection of R. raoultii and R. monacensis in questing larvae of Hae. punctata suggests the possible transovarial transmission of these Rickettsia species in ticks. The detection of R. hoogstraalii for the first time in Romania increases the reported SFG Rickettsia diversity in the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The 2020-2021 season was the hitherto most devastating when considering bird numbers and duration in Europe. Surveillance data, virologic results and epidemiologic investigations from the 2020-2021 outbreaks in Sweden were analysed. Subtypes H5N8 and H5N5 were detected on 24 farms with poultry or other captive birds. In wild birds, subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, H5N4, H5Nx were detected in 130 out of 811 sampled birds. There was a spatiotemporal association between cases in wild birds and poultry. Based on phylogeny and epidemiology, most of the introductions of HPAI to commercial poultry were likely a result of indirect contact with wild birds. A definite route of introduction to poultry could not be established although some biosecurity breaches were observed. No spread between farms was identified but airborne spread between flocks on the same farm was suspected. Our findings exemplify the challenges posed by the continuously changing influenza viruses that seem to adapt to a broader species spectrum. This points to the importance of wild bird surveillance, compliance to biosecurity, and identification of risk factors for introduction on poultry farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Because malignant (MPNST) and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNST) are relatively common STS in dogs, the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PDGFR-&#946;, contributing to its characterization as a potential target for their treatment. A total of 19 samples were included, 9 histologically classified as benign and the other 10 as malignant. The results showed diffuse immunoexpression in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells. Six (66.7%) BPNST expressed the receptor in less than 25% of neoplastic cells and only three (33.3%) exhibited labelling in more than 25% of neoplastic cells. In contrast, all MPNST expressed PDGFR-&#946;, and in 8 (80%) of these samples, the receptor was expressed in more than 25% of neoplastic cells, and only 2 (20%) cases expressed the receptor in less than 25% of neoplastic cells. PDGFR-&#946; expression was significantly higher in MPNST and larger tumors, suggesting that drugs able to inhibit the activity of this tyrosine kinase receptor, such as toceranib, may be considered in the approach of unresectable tumors and/or in the context of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report describes a case of canine parainfluenza virus infection in a vaccinated household dog with an acute respiratory symptom (dry cough), who underwent clinical and endoscopic investigations for a suspected foreign body. Cytological investigations carried out on the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) tested negative for the presence of inflammatory or infectious processes and could have been misleading the clinicians. By the molecular analyses (PCR) carried out on the BALF, canine parainfluenza virus was exclusively detected without the simultaneous presence of other respiratory pathogens associated to CIRDC. This case report emphasizes the role of molecular diagnostics in the differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases, in order to avoid underestimating the circulation of the parainfluenza virus in the canine population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study we evaluated the effect of anticoccidial vaccination on intestinal health in clinically healthy organic Ross 308 chickens. On each of two farms, one unvaccinated flock (A1 and B1) was compared to one vaccinated flock (A2 and B2) until ten weeks of age (WOA). Faecal oocysts were counted weekly, and species were identified by PCR (ITS-1 gene). Lesion scoring, CP quantification and PCR targeting the CP NetB toxin gene were performed at three, four, and six WOA and chickens were weighed. Necropsies were performed on randomly selected chickens to identify coccidiosis/NE. Oocyst shedding peaked at three WOA in all flocks. Later oocyst shedding (E. tenella/E. maxima) in unvaccinated flocks at 5-7 WOA coincided with coccidiosis/NE. Although results differed somewhat between farms, vaccination was associated with lower intestinal lesion scores, reduced caecal CP counts, lower proportions of netB-positive CP, lower body weight at three-four WOA, and similar or slightly increased body weight at six WOA. In conclusion, the intestinal health of organic broilers can benefit from anticoccidial vaccination when oocyst exposure levels are high.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Accidentally, S. Thompson was found to be pathogenic to embryos of white feather broiler at a poultry farm in China. Therefore, this study aimed to explore antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity of clinical S. Thompson isolated from dead poultry embryos. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA and seven housekeeping genes showed that the 14 clinical S. Thompson were closely related. The core-genome multilocus sequence typing of 14 clinical S. Thompson based on whole-genome sequencing was cgST-12774, consistent with the only two strains of S. Thompson from humans in China as reported in the NCBI database. The antimicrobial resistance gene analysis demonstrated that all strains carried aac(6')-Iaa and the polymyxin resistance gene mcr-9. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests for 18 antibiotics showed that S. Thompson isolates displayed resistance against streptomycin (100%), ampicillin (35.7%), and doxycycline (14.3%), but sensitivity to polymyxin B, proving that the mcr-9 gene had not appeared resistance phenotype. Virulence genes Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) SPI1-5, type I fimbriae gene (fimA), flagellar assembly genes (bcfC, flhD, fliA, fliC, fljB, flgK, and lpfC), and other virulence genes (iroN, pagC, and cigR) were found in each S. Thompson isolate. Additionally, the bacterial inoculation experiment with 1-day-old chicks revealed that clinical S. Thompson was highly pathogenic to newborn chicks after yolk sac inoculation. This study highlighted that the S. Thompson isolated from poultry embryos and the S. Thompson causing human foodborne diarrhea in some parts of China belong to the same cgMLST typology (cgST-12774) and showed the pathogenicity of this clinical S. Thompson to chicks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The incisors of 20 horses were examined radiographically, macroscopically, and via micro-computed tomography (&#181;CT) to discriminate EORTH-affected teeth. Five categories from healthy to severely affected teeth were formed and teeth from each category were examined histologically to evaluate the opportunity of earlier radiographic diagnosis. Histologically, odontoclastic resorptive lesions, leukocytic infiltrations, and areas of irregular cementum and granulation tissue were observed. The extent and severity of histological findings were correlated to the &#181;CT data. Micro-CT imaging was suitable to detect subtle irregularities in the dental substances which were referred to as resorptive lesions. Although histological examinations confirmed the presence of resorptive lesions, not all of them were classified as pathological conditions. Instead, repaired surface lesions were documented which were regarded as a physiological condition. Nevertheless, incisors which were radiographically regarded as healthy can also feature histological signs of EOTRH. Therefore, due to the possibility of misinterpreting radiographic findings combined with superimpositions on intraoral radiographs, the detection of early resorptive lesions remains challenging.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878367</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Feed Space Allowance and Perch Design Criteria for Broiler Breeders Determined by Biometric Data.</Title>	<Abstract>The equipment used in broiler breeder houses is an important factor in allowing the expression of the various behaviours of the animals, and thus realizing high welfare standards. Presently, detailed requirements for the equipment in broiler breeder houses are not specified in Germany, especially feed space and perch design allowance. One reason is that basic biometric data on broiler breeders are lacking. To close this gap, a pilot study was conducted, and birds' width, weight, and feet were measured. Broiler breeders at 22 weeks of age (50 female and 17 male) were weighed and photographed digitally, and their body widths were calculated from the photographs. Female broiler breeders weighed 2791.80 &#177; 334.99 g on average and showed a body width of 20.63 &#177; 1.88 cm. For males, a mean of 3615.88 &#177; 432.46 g was measured with a body width of 21.94 &#177; 2.32 cm. Our examinations revealed that a trough side length of 21.00 cm per hen and 22.00 cm per cock must be provided to ensure that all broiler breeders have equal access to feed. The same dimensions should be planned as the perch length for each animal. Measurements of broiler breeders' feet (506 female and 150 male Cobb 500) were performed at 60 weeks of age. The length of each toe and the width and length of the foot pad of both sexes were photographed and measured digitally. Female broiler breeders' feet showed an average length of 10.14 cm, and male birds showed a length of 12.05 cm. Based on recommendations for the perch design for laying hens, round and oval perches for broiler breeders should have a circumference of at least 11.30 cm (female) or 13.40 cm (male). For angular perches, the upper contact area should have a width of 2.80 cm (female) or 3.40 cm (male). The obtained biometric data could be a useful basis for the development of legal requirements for broiler breeders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of M. bovis in adult cows and calves in the south-west region of Western Australia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 29 dairy farms with 699 apparently healthy adult lactating cows and 495 young calves during 2019-2020. Nasal swabs and blood samples collected from the animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were assessed for M. bovis-specific proteins and antibodies by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Mycoplasma immunogenic lipase A- Enzyme-Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (MilA ELISA). A seroprevalence of 42.5% (95% CI: 38.9-46.2) and 61% (95% CI: 56.6-65.2) was found in adult lactating cows and calves, respectively. The herd-level seroprevalence of M. bovis ranged from 4% (95% CI: 07-19.5) to 92% (95% CI: 75.0-97.8) in adult lactating cows and 25% (95% CI: 10.2-49.5) to 87% (95% CI: 67.9-95.5) for calves in these farms. None of the BTM and nasal swab samples were positive for M. bovis, indicating an absence of any current active infections on the farms. The female calves and pure Holstein-Friesian animals are twice as likely to be seropositive for M. bovis compared to male calves (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.7-3.5) and Holstein-Friesian crossbred calves (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.7-3.5). The high seroprevalence in both adult and young cattle in the southwest dairy farms of Western Australia warrants more effective farm biosecurity measures and further evaluation of the current prevention and management measures practiced on the farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A bifactorial experiment was conducted for 21 days (d) on 18 primiparous sows (195 &#177; 3 days old). The sows were fed two diets: (i) a control diet (SO) based on soybean oil (1.6%), with an 18.82 n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio; (ii) an experimental diet (HO) based on hemp seed oil (1.6%), with a 9.14 n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio. The milk contained an elevated level of linoleic acids (LA), n-3 FA, and especially alpha-linolenic acids (ALA), while the n-6:n-3 ratio declined using hemp oil. The Ig concentration was higher in colostrum than in milk. In the first few hours, the IgG in the plasma of piglets was more than double that of maternal plasma IgG (+2.39 times). A period effect (p &lt; 0.0001) for IgG concentration in the plasma of piglets was recorded (40% at 10 d, respectively 73% lower at 21 d than 12 h after parturition). However, the sow diet did not affect Ig (p &gt; 0.05). The frequency of diarrhoea declined after about 7 d. The value of the rate of diarrhoea was 6.2% lower in the PHO group. We found a 4.5% decline in E-CH4 in the HO group. Applying multiple linear regression, feed intake, n-6:n-3 ratio, ALA, and lean meat were potential indicators in estimating E-CH4. In conclusion, sow dietary hemp seed oil increased lean meat %, milk EFA, and milk IgM. Significant changes in the other dependent variables of interest (body weight, plasma Igs in sows and offspring, E-CH4 production) were not recorded. There was reduced diarrhoea which shows that EFA could play a therapeutic role in the incidence of diarrhoea and in lowering of E-CH4 emission in sows and progeny. All dependent variables were significantly altered at different time points, except for fat concentration in milk and sow plasma IgG.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In total, 63 conventional dairy cattle farms with zero-grazing in Northern Germany were assessed using selected animal welfare indicators (body condition score, integument alterations, lameness, milk somatic cell count, and social behaviour) of the Welfare Quality&#174; protocol. Additionally, housing characteristics such as designs of barns, cubicles, and floors were documented during farm visits and farmers were interviewed concerning their common management routines. Farms were categorized into a high welfare or low welfare group by calculating upper and lower tertiles for each of the animal welfare indicators separately. Both groups were compared regarding housing conditions and management practices using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. Several associations between housing and management factors and animal welfare indicators were demonstrated in univariable analysis (p &lt; 0.20). Significant effects within multivariable logistic regression analysis were determined for lameness (routine use of foot-baths), milk somatic cell count (milking frequency) and social behaviour (cow-to-stall ratio) (p &lt; 0.05). Comparing farms with higher and lower animal welfare status can provide useful information about effective options to improve animal welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This comparative study investigates the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of two field techniques for diagnosing V. destructor infestations in hives. The EasyCheck device (V&#233;to-pharma) was used in two of its application modes, namely, the sugar roll test and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection. The experiments were conducted on 15 samples of 300 bees each taken from the same frame and checked for the presence of mites using standard and modified field techniques in both uncaged and caged queen hive conditions. The results demonstrate that the sugar roll technique is significantly more effective and safer than CO2 injection, allowing for a higher accuracy in diagnosing a V. destructor infestation. Furthermore, the evaluation of mites present on bees in brood block conditions has proven to be particularly reliable. Considering the number of mites on the filter of the device as an additional step helps to implement the diagnostic accuracy of the CO2 injection technique, however, not achieving the efficacy results of the sugar roll.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878372</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Chitosan/Calcium-Coated Ginsenoside Rb1 Phosphate Flower-like Microparticles as an Adjuvant to Enhance Immune Responses.</Title>	<Abstract>Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious immunocompromising disorder that caused great economic losses in the poultry industry. The field-level control over IBD is primarily via vaccination. The development of a highly effective IBV vaccine has drawn great attention worldwide. Chitosan/Calcium Phosphate (CS/CaP) nanoparticle was a newly developed effective biological delivery system for drug and antigen. Ginsenoside Rb1 is one of the main bioactive components of ginseng root extract, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunological enhancement effects. Until now, the combined effect of CS/CaP and ginsenoside Rb1 on the chicken immune response had remained unknown. In this study, the GRb1 and IL-4 were encapsulated into Calcium phosphate and chitosan core structure nanoparticles microspheres (GRb1/IL-4@CS/CaP), and the effect of a newly developed delivery system on an infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) attenuated vaccine was further evaluated. The results demonstrated that GRb1/IL-4@CS/CaP treatment could induce the activation of chicken dendritic cells (DCs), with the upregulated expression of MHCII and CD80, and the increased production of IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945;. Importantly, GRb1/IL-4@CS/CaP could trigger a higher level of IBDV-specific IgG and a higher ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 than the traditional adjuvant groups, promoting the production of cytokine, including IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-1&#945;, and IL-1&#946;, in chicken serum after 28 d and 42 d post-vaccine. Taken in all, GRb1/IL-4@CS/CaP could elicit prolonged vigorous immune responses for IBDV attenuated vaccine in chicken, which might provide an effective adjuvant system for avian vaccine development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The extent to which human-borne infectious diseases are contributing to this trend is still poorly understood. This is due to insufficient or fragmented knowledge on the abundance and distribution of current wild great ape populations, the difficulty obtaining optimal biological samples for diagnostic testing, and the scarcity of pathogen typing data of sufficient quality. This review summarises current information on the most clinically relevant pathogens of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal nature for which transmission from humans to wild great apes is suspected. After appraising the robustness of available epidemiological and/or molecular typing evidence, we attempt to categorise each pathogen according to its likelihood of truly being of human origin. We further discuss those agents for which anthroponotic transmission is more likely. These include two viral (Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus), one bacterial (diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli), and two parasitic (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis) pathogens. Finally, we identify the main drawbacks impairing research on anthroponotic pathogen transmission in wild great apes and propose research lines that may contribute to bridging current knowledge gaps.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nowadays, its accuracy is poorly understood and variable interpretation of histological criteria leads to a lack of standardisation and impossibility to compare studies. This study aimed to quantify the reproducibility of histological diagnosis and grading in CMTs. A blinded ring test on 36 CMTs was performed by 15 veterinary pathologists with different levels of education, after discussion of critical points on the Davis-Thompson Foundation Classification and providing consensus guidelines. Kappa statistics were used to compare the interobserver variability. The overall concordance rate of diagnostic interpretations of WP on identification of hyperplasia-dysplasia/benign/malignant lesions showed a substantial agreement (average k ranging from 0.66 to 0.82, with a k-combined of 0.76). Instead, outcomes on ICD-O-3.2 morphological code /diagnosis of histotype had only a moderate agreement (average k ranging from 0.44 and 0.64, with a k-combined of 0.54). The results demonstrated that standardised classification and consensus guidelines can produce moderate to substantial agreement; however, further efforts are needed to increase this agreement in distinguishing benign versus malignant lesions and in histological grading.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878375</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genotype, but Not Climate, Affects the Resistance of Honey Bees (Apis mellifera) to Viral Infections and to the Mite Varroa destructor.</Title>	<Abstract>This study was conducted to analyze the effect of genotype and climate on the resistance of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies to parasitic and viral diseases. The prevalence and intensity of parasitism by Varroa destructor, or infection by Nosema spp., and four honey bee viruses were determined in 365 colonies of predominantly European or African ancestry (descendants of A. m. scutellata) in subtropical and temperate regions of Mexico. Varroa destructor was the most prevalent parasite (95%), whilst N. ceranae was the least prevalent parasite (15%). Deformed wing virus (DWV) and black queen cell virus (BQCV) were the only viruses detected, at frequencies of 38% and 66%, respectively. Varroa destructor was significantly more prevalent in colonies of European ancestry (p &lt; 0.05), and the intensity of parasitism by V. destructor or infection by DWV and BQCV was also significantly higher in colonies of European descent than in African descent colonies (p &lt; 0.01), although no genotype&#8722;parasite associations were found for N. ceranae. Additionally, significant and positive correlations were found between V. destructor and DWV levels, and the abundance of these pathogens was negatively correlated with the African ancestry of colonies (p &lt; 0.01). However, there were no significant effects of environment on parasitism or infection intensity for the colonies of both genotypes. Therefore, it is concluded that the genotype of honey bee colonies, but not climate, influences their resistance to DWV, BQCV, and V. destructor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The diagnosis included unilateral absence of the right external jugular vein and bilateral hypoplasia of the external jugular veins, associated with persistent left cranial vena cava. Vascular ultrasound and computed tomography were used for the diagnosis. Jugular vein anomalies can affect decision-making regarding the central venous catheterization needed to perform procedures such as pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty or central catheter placement. Based on the results of the present case series, anomalies of external jugular veins should be considered in French and English bulldogs when the external jugular veins cannot be palpated or when echocardiography shows coronary sinus dilation. Vascular ultrasound or computed tomography may help identify jugular venous anomalies and should be considered in the preoperative evaluation of bulldogs that need to undergo interventional procedures requiring transjugular catheterization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Six crossbred Holstein Friesian (HF) &#215; Thai lactating dairy cows with 110 &#177; 10 days in milk were randomly assigned to three different amounts of YERSEK at 0%, 10%, and 20% in a concentrate mixture using a 3 &#215; 3 repeated Latin square design. Cows were fed with concentrate diets at a concentrate-to-milk yield ratio of 1:1.5, with rice straw fed ad libitum. The inclusion of YERSEK did not adversely affect feed intake, nutrient intake, or digestibility (p &gt; 0.05), whereas ether extract intake and digestibility linearly increased in dairy cows receiving YERSEK (p &lt; 0.01). Increasing YERSEK levels did not adversely affect blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, hematological parameters, or microbial protein synthesis (p &gt; 0.05). Supplementation of YERSEK did not influence milk production, lactose, or protein levels (p &gt; 0.05). However, milk fat and total solids decreased linearly (p &lt; 0.05) with the addition of YERSEK. In conclusion, in a concentrate diet, YERSEK could be used as a protein source without negative effects on feed intake, digestibility, hematology, microbial protein synthesis, or milk yield. However, it reduced the milk fat and total solids of tropical lactating dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Epineural neurorrhaphy in canine sciatic nerve injury are described in this report. An 11-month-old, castrated male Maltese dog, presented with an one-month history of non-weight bearing lameness and knuckling of the right pelvic limb. The dog showed absence of superficial and deep pain perception on the dorsal and lateral surfaces below the stifle joint. The dog had undergone femoral head and neck osteotomy in the right pelvic limb one month prior to referral at a local hospital. Based on physical and neurological examinations, peripheral nerve injury of the right pelvic limb was suspected. Radiography showed irregular bony proliferation around the excised femoral neck. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed sciatic nerve injury with inconspicuous continuity at the greater trochanter level. A sciatic nerve neurotmesis was suspected and surgical repair was decided. During surgery, non-viable tissue of the sciatic nerve was debrided, and epineural neurorrhaphy was performed to bridge a large, 20-mm defect. The superficial and deep pain perception was progressively improved and restored at 3 weeks postoperatively, and the dog exhibited a gradual improvement in motor function. At 10 weeks postoperatively, the dog showed no neurological deficit including knuckling but the tarsal joint hyperextension did not improve due to ankylosis. The dog had undergone tarsal arthrodesis and exhibited almost normal limb function without any neurologic sequela until the last follow-up at 2.5 years postoperatively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Micronised Purified Flavonoid Fraction (MPFF) is a polyphenolic flavonoid compound which is considered to have many health-related properties such as antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, phlebotonic, and several vascular-protecting activities. The aim was to evaluate the effects of a new strategic therapy for metritis based on MPFF intrauterine infusions during the early postpartum in dairy cows naturally infected by Escherichia coli. The clinical effects on reproductive anatomical structures and chronological involution dynamics were monitored until day 24 postpartum by ultrasonography. Moreover, uterine bacteriological and cytological (polymorphonuclear neutrophils; PMNs) profiles were analysed before and after MPFF infusion. The results showed that the success rate (% cure) at day 24 postpartum was improved significantly when using higher MPFF doses (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, MPFF treatment acutely diminished the size of the cervix and uterus and improved the involution process during the first 24 days (p &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of pathogenic bacteria found in in vitro cultures was significantly variable (p &lt; 0.01), as were the antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Pathogenic bacteria isolates decreased after MPFF applications in a dose&#8722;response fashion (p &lt; 0.01), while isolates obtained from controls and low-dose-MPFF-treated animals were stable and similar (p &gt; 0.05). The sensitivity patterns of pathogenic bacteria isolated in in vitro cultures from MPFF-treated animals were variable, although resistance to E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus spp., and coliforms was shown irrespective of the MPFF doses used. However, MPFF-treated cows showed a dose&#8722;response effect regarding PMN rates (p &lt; 0.05). The calving-first service, calving&#8722;conception interval, and conception rate improved significantly from using higher MPFF doses (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that MPFF treatment differentially affects uterine involution, bacteriological profiles, cytological traits, and reproductive performance in metritis-positive dairy cows naturally infected by E. coli.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thus, this study aims to investigate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in client-owned cats from Portugal and evaluate the infection risk of cats that maintain contact with human COVID-19 cases. A total of 176 cats, belonging to 94 households, were sampled. Cat owners answered an online questionnaire, and cats were screened for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial ELISA. Twenty (21.3%) households reported at least one confirmed human COVID-19 case. Forty cats (22.7%) belonged to a COVID-19-positive and 136 (77.3%) to a COVID-19-negative household. The seroprevalences of cats from COVID-19-positive and -negative households were 5.0% (2/40) and 0.7% (1/136). The two SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cats from COVID-19-positive households had an indoor lifestyle, and their owners stated that they maintained a close and frequent contact with them, even after being diagnosed with COVID-19, pointing towards human-to-cat transmission. The SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cat from the COVID-19-negative household had a mixed indoor/outdoor lifestyle and chronic diseases. Owners of the three SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cats did not notice clinical signs or behavior changes. This study highlights the low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from COVID-19-positive human household members to domestic cats, even in a context of close and frequent human-animal contact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

T1D mice treated with fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 showed reduced fecal output as well as improved gut transit time. Cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist, AM251 blocked the effects of URB597, which may demonstrate that FAAH inhibitor is a potential remedial strategy for GI dysmotility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although several singular case reports have been published, no large case series is available. The aim of this study is to report a multicentric retrospective collection of suture exostosis cases. Data concerning horses with suture exostosis in the facial region were collected retrospectively. Information regarding breed, age, gender, history, imaging findings, initiated treatment, response to treatment and follow up was recorded. One hundred and five cases of various breeds were reported. Analysis revealed the cases could be grouped into four entities: 45 developed following sino-nasal surgery, 23 following trauma, seven with underlying sinus pathology and 25 idiopathic. Treatment consisted of sequestra removal, plate fixation, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drugs or no treatment. Whereas initial localized pain fades within few days or weeks, resolution or reduction of the swelling was obtained in most cases after 3 months to 1.5 years. The etiopathogenesis of suture exostosis seems to consist of different entities. Identification of an underlying cause, particularly the presence of a bone sequester and infection is important to speed up resolution and before concluding an idiopathic case. When performing sinusotomies, it is important to provide as little trauma as possible to the surgical site in order to prevent suture exostosis as a complication.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to compare results from cytology, bacterial culture and 16S amplicon profiling. Twenty samples from 16 dogs with chronic suppurative otitis externa were collected. A direct cytological evaluation was carried out during the consultations. Aerobic bacterial culture and susceptibility were performed by an external laboratory used in routine practice. For 16S amplicon profiling, DNA was extracted and the hypervariable segment V1&#8722;V3 of the 16S rDNA was amplified and then sequenced with a MiSeq Illumina sequence carried out by the Mothur software using the SILVA database. A good correlation between cytology and bacterial culture was observed in 60% of the samples. Some bacterial species revealed by bacterial culture were present with low relative abundance (&lt;10%) in 16S amplicon profiling. Some bacterial species revealed by the 16S amplicon profiling analysis were not identified with culture; most of the time, the offending species was a Corynebacterium. To conclude, a careful interpretation of the results of bacterial culture should be made and always be in agreement with the cytology. The 16S amplicon profiling method appears to be a more sensitive method for detecting strains present in suppurative otitis but does not provide information on bacterial susceptibility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Variation in pathologist threshold levels of resident inflammatory cells in the tissue of interest can further decrease inter-pathologist agreement. This study applied a predictive modeling tool to bladder histology slides that were assessed by four pathologists: first without animal and clinical information, then with this information, and finally using the predictive tool. All three assessments were performed twice, using digital whole-slide images (WSI) and then glass slides. Results showed marked variation in pathologists' interpretation of bladder slides, with kappa agreement values of 7-37% without any animal or clinical information, 23-37% with animal signalment and history, and 31-42% when our predictive tool was applied, for digital WSI and glass slides. The concurrence of test pathologists to the reference diagnosis was 60% overall. This study provides a starting point for the use of predictive modeling in standardizing pathologist agreement in veterinary pathology. It also highlights the importance of high-quality whole-slide imaging to limit the effect of digitization on inter-pathologist agreement and the benefit of continued standardization of tissue assessment in veterinary pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study explored whether the lockdown in Italy affected the cat-owner relationship, as well as cat behaviour and welfare. A survey that included questions on owner and cat's demographics, living environment, cat behaviour and a modified version of the Cat/Dog Relationship Scale (C/DORS) was distributed online during the lockdown and was completed by 548 cat owners, mainly women (81.6%). With regard to the C/DORS subscales, both emotional closeness and cat-owner interactions increased during confinement, as opposed to a reduction in perceived costs. The effect of the type of job, family role and owner's age on the C/DORS scores suggests that the relationship improved for those owners that, due to the lockdown, increased the time spent with their cats. For 58.8% of respondents, their cat's general behaviour did not change, but when changes occurred, they were mostly positive (20.4%). Attention-seeking and demanding behaviours were the most increased during lockdown (25.7%). Cats with pre-existing problematic behaviours tended to either remain stable or improve during confinement. The overall positive effects of lockdown-related environmental changes on a cat's behaviour suggest that some aspects of commonly implemented cat management practices should be revised to improve cat welfare in normal circumstances.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, an AI protocol at natural estrus in organic Churra sheep was performed. In the first phase (AI protocol development), 125 ewes were exocervically inseminated, and their fertility was assessed based on the following factors: number of AI, physiological state, body condition, estrus detection-AI interval, and vaginal fluids in cervix. That protocol was repeated for six consecutive years. In all individuals, fertilities based on the timing of insemination after estrus detection were very high. Lactating ewes produced better results than did dry ewes, which was probably because of the better feeding of the former. In addition, double insemination increased the fertility of ewes whose estrus was detected within 16 h of onset. Body condition and amount of vaginal fluid were correlated with fertility. Exocervical inseminations at natural estrus can produce acceptable fertility and prolificity in Churra ewes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The goals of this study were (1) to describe the prevalence of S. aureus in Israeli dairy farms; (2) to characterize the spa-based clonal structure of mastitis-related S. aureus isolates; (3) to analyze the transmission network of a large outbreak within a single farm and (4) to characterize the virulence factors of the outbreak strain. The prevalence and the molecular survey were performed on all Israeli IMI-related isolates, 9.2019-8.2020. Molecular methods included spa-typing for the survey and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the investigation of the farm 'A' outbreak. During the one-year survey, S. aureus was identified in 152 dairy farms, with a total of 440 positive samples. The spa t2873 was found in 284 isolates (64.5%) across 112 farms (73.6%). Other common types included t529 (n = 46), t9303 (n = 34) and the methicillin-resistant S. aureus t011 (n = 11). The highest number of cases (n = 25) was detected in Farm 'A', all of which were found to be spa t2873. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that most transmission events occurred within the same milking group, and inter-group transmission was due to the transfer of cows between groups or due to consecutive milking order. The spa t2873 strain contained putative virulence genes, including various intracellular and collagen adhesion proteins. Our study revealed the dissemination of the t2873 strain to the majority of Israeli dairy farms. The possibility of inter-farm transmission should be monitored and prevented.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Inside the oviduct, sperm are stored, waiting for the ovulated oocyte where they bind to the apical surface of the oviduct cells, which in turn hold sperm to form a sperm nest. The essential functions of the sperm reservoir include attaching spermatozoa to oviduct epithelial cells, selecting intact, good-quality sperm with an end result of extending sperm life expectancy. The current study aimed to evaluate the fertilization ability of sperm that bind to cell aggregates from different parts of the oviduct (infundibulum-ampulla-isthmus), and to assess the effect of heparin and or progesterone (P4) on the in-vitro fertilization ability of sperm co-incubated with cell aggregates from the isthmus. In-vitro fertilization was identified as a cleaved oocyte to two cells or more. The sperm bound to cell aggregates from the isthmus improved the rate of in-vitro fertilization (48.09%) compared to aggregates from the infundibulum (36.90%) and ampulla (37.61%). Moreover, pre-treatment of mature COCs with heparin (40 &#956;g/mL) and P4 (80 nanomolar) play a coactive role that improves the in-vitro fertilization ability of sperm bound to cell aggregates from isthmus (63.33%), compared to 42.61% in the absence of cells aggregates. In conclusion, binding to cell aggregates from isthmus improves the in-vitro fertilization ability of Bovine sperm. Additionally, heparin, together with P4, exerts a synergistic action that improves the in-vitro fertilizing potential of sperm attached to cell aggregates from the isthmus of the bovine oviduct.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Domestic species show different susceptibility to aMPV subtypes, whereas sporadic detections in wild birds have revealed links between epidemiology and migration routes. To explore the epidemiology of aMPV in wild species, a molecular survey was conducted on samples that were collected from wild birds during avian influenza surveillance activity in Italy. The samples were screened in pools by multiplex real time RT-PCR assays in order to detect and differentiate subtypes A, B, C, and those that have been newly identified. All the birds were negative, except for a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) that was positive for aMPV subtype C (sampled in Padua, in the Veneto region, in 2018). The sequencing of partial M and full G genes placed the strain in an intermediate position between European and Chinese clusters. The absence of subtypes A and B supports the negligible role of wild birds, whereas subtype C detection follows previous serological and molecular identifications in Italy. Subtype C circulation in domestic and wild populations emphasizes the importance of molecular test development and adoption to allow the prompt detection of this likely emerging subtype.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to determine the ability of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to decrease the expression of arginase and other soluble mediators by canine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and to determine the inhibitory activity of arginase on canine T-lymphocytes. The immunomodulatory ability of ATRA (2 &#181;M) on canine MDMs was evaluated via reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), flow cytometry, arginase activity assay, and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Arginase effects on T-lymphocyte phenotype and proliferation were then evaluated by flow cytometry. ATRA consistently decreased MDM expression of IL6, TGFB1, NOS2, ARG1, and CIITA transcripts, by approximately 2-4-fold, although this did not reach statistical significance for ARG1 or CIITA. Furthermore, arginase activity was decreased in ATRA-treated MDMs while the MDM phenotype remained unchanged. Arginase decreased the expression of granzyme B on CD8+ T-lymphocytes and inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte proliferation. These findings suggested that ATRA could inhibit canine MDM production of soluble inflammatory/immunosuppressive mediators. These data also revealed that arginase decreased canine T-lymphocyte proliferation and granzyme B expression. Further studies are needed to determine whether ATRA could reverse the immunosuppressive effects of myeloid cells on canine T-lymphocytes in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35878392</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of the Expression of Angiogenic Factors in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Domestic Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a common malignant skin cancer with a significant impact on health, and it is important to determine the degree of reliance of CSCC on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis. Major regulators of angiogenesis are the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and their associated receptors. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing produces multiple isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF with distinct biological properties. Several studies highlight the function of VEGF-A in CSCC, but there are no studies of the different isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF for this neoplasm. We characterized the expression of three isoforms of VEGF-A, two isoforms of PLGF, and their receptors in cat CSCC biopsies compared to normal haired skin (NHS). Although our results revealed no significant changes in transcript levels of panVEGF-A or their isoforms, the mRNA levels of PLGF I and the receptors Flt-1 and KDR were downregulated in CSCC compared to NHS. Differences were observed in ligand:receptor mRNA expression ratio, with the expression of VEGF-A relative to its receptor KDR higher in CSCC, which is consistent with our hypothesis and prior human SCC studies. Immunolocalization in tissue showed increased expression of all measured factors and receptors in tumor cells compared to NHS and surrounding vasculature. We conclude that the factors measured may play a pivotal role in CSCC growth, although further studies are needed to clarify the role of angiogenic factors in feline CSCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Activating mutations of the proto-oncogenes c-KIT and PDGFRA drive GIST oncogenesis and are used to predict the response to RTK-inhibitors in human oncology. Currently, the frequency and significance of these mutations in canine GIST have not been adequately explored. Therefore, we investigated the mutational status of c-KIT (exons 9, 11 and 13) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes by PCR followed by fragment analysis for c-KIT deletions and PCR followed by screening with DHPLC and direct sequencing confirmation for single nucleotide variations in 17 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded canine GISTs confirmed by KIT immunopositivity. c-KIT mutations were detected in 47% of cases, with a mutation detection rate significantly higher (p = 0.0004, Fisher's exact test) and always involving exon 11. A PDGFRA gene mutation (exon 18) was identified in one case. Even if follow-up data were not available for all cases, four cases with documented abdominal metastases displayed c-KIT mutations. These data confirm that c-KIT exon 11 mutations occur frequently in canine GISTs, and identify the presence of a PDGFRA mutation similar to human GISTs. This study also suggests a potential association of c-KIT mutation with more aggressive biological behavior.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nellore heifers (n = 259) were used, divided into two studies. Experiment I evaluated the ovarian follicular dynamics in 64 Nellore heifers submitted to different FTAI protocols (n = 32/group) using either FSH or eCG. In Experiment II, the pregnancy rate was evaluated in 195 heifers submitted to FTAI protocols and divided into two groups: FSH (n = 97) and eCG (n = 98). In Experiment I, the ultrasound examination showed that the maximum diameter of the dominant and preovulatory follicles and the ovulation time were similar between the FSH and eCG groups (p &gt; 0.05). However, the ovulation rate was higher in the eCG group when compared to FSH (p = 0.014). In Experiment II, females that received eCG presented a higher pregnancy rate (58.1%) when compared to FSH (40.2%) (p = 0.012). The use of eCG in the FTAI protocol in Nellore heifers promoted a higher ovulation rate and increased pregnancy rate and may be the most suitable alternative to increase conception rates in animals that are raised in an extensive system under tropical conditions in the Amazon.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The number of studies focused on MR and MRCP for pancreatic disease in small animals is very limited. MR has been described for the evaluation of insulinoma in dogs and to investigate pancreatitis in cats. The studies were based on a standard protocol with T2 weighted (w) fast recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) with and without fat suppression, T1w FSE pre-contrast and T1w FSE post-contrast with and without fat suppression. MRCP after secretin stimulation has been described in cats to assess the pancreatic ductal system, taking advantage of pulse sequences heavily T2w as rapid acquisition with rapid enhancement (RARE), fast-recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) sequences and single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) sequences. In addition to the standard protocol, fast spoiled gradient recalled echo pulse sequences (fSPGR) and volume interpolated 3D gradient-echo T1w pulse sequences pre and post-contrast have also been used in cats, reaching the goal of assessing the biliary tree and the pancreatic duct with the same sequence and in multiple planes. Despite the small amount of data, the results show potential, and the most recent technical innovations, in particular, focused on diffusion MRI and fast acquisition, further support the need for continued evaluation of MRI as an effective instrument for the investigation of pancreatic disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Molecular markers can be used for the quick diagnosis of mastitis infection, consequently reducing the loss caused by this disease. Lactoferrin (LTF) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) have been suggested as candidate genes for mastitis; however, their associations with the mastitis incidence and milk components have not been reported in Vietnamese Holstein cows. This study examined the association of TLR2 and LTF polymorphisms with subclinical mastitis and milk components in the Holstein breed raised in Vietnam. Among 192 samples, we identified 44 mastitis-positive samples (22.92%). The mastitis significantly reduced the fat and lactose components in milk (p &lt; 0.001) but increased the protein concentration in milk. A total of 94 (49%) and 98 (51%) cows had AA and AB genotypes for the LTF gene, respectively. No significant association was found between the LTF genotypes and the milk component traits or mastitis incidence (p &gt; 0.05). The interaction between LTF and mastitis incidence was significantly associated with the protein percentage (p = 0.01). A total of 78, 76, and 38 cows had genotypes GG, GT, and TT for the TLR2 gene, respectively. TLR2 genotypes were not significantly associated with mastitis incidence (p &gt; 0.05) but were significantly associated with pH value (p = 0.03). The interaction between TLR2 and mastitis incidence was significantly associated with the fat (p = 0.02) and protein percentage (p = 0.04). Further studies are required to confirm the roles of LTF and TFL2 in mastitis in the Holstein breed in Vietnam.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several lines of evidence show that the gut microbiome of cockroaches, snakes, crocodiles, water monitor lizards, and other species may possess molecules that are bioactive. As these animals are routinely exposed to a variety of microorganisms in their natural environments, it is likely that they have developed methods to counter these microbes, which may be a contributing factor in their persistence on the planet for millions of years. In addition to the immune system, the gut microbiota of a host may thwart colonization of the gastro-intestine by pathogenic and/or foreign microorganisms through two mechanisms: (i) production of molecules with antibacterial potential targeting foreign microorganisms, or (ii) production of molecules that trigger host immunity targeting foreign microorganisms that penetrate the host. Herein, we discuss and deliberate on the current literature examining antibacterial activities that stem from the gut bacteria of animals such as crocodiles, cockroaches, and water monitor lizards, amongst other interesting species, which likely encounter a plethora of microorganisms in their natural environments. The overall aim is to unveil a potential library of novel bioactive molecules for the benefit of human health and for utilization against infectious diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is considered to be a causative environmental pathogen and frequently enters into mammary glands, causing inflammation. Artemisinin is a highly effective malaria remedy and is not easy to develop drug resistance to. In recent years, other effects of artemisinin (including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, etc.) have been increasingly discovered and applied. The current study aimed to investigate whether artemisinin could attenuate E. coli-induced inflammation. Through the E. coli mastitis model in MAC-T cells and mice, the protective effects of artemisinin were analyzed by CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8), Western blot, and RT-qPCR. The results showed that artemisinin reversed the decrease of cell viability and upregulated TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4)/NF-&#954;B (nuclear factor &#954;B) and MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/p38 signaling pathways, as well as restrained the expression of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1&#946; mRNA caused by E. coli. Meanwhile, artemisinin also alleviated mammary tissue damage, reduced inflammatory cells' infiltration, and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors in a mice mastitis model. This study demonstrated that artemisinin alleviated the inflammatory response of mouse mastitis and MAC-T cells induced by E. coli, thus providing a practical approach for the clinical control of mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sporadic SE outbreaks in Japan are mostly caused by the E. rhusiopathiae serovar 1a variant featured by methionine (M) and isoleucine (I) at amino acid positions 203 and 257 of the surface protective antigen (Spa) A protein (M203/I257 SpaA-type). To determine if current vaccines are effective against infection with this variant in pigs, one representative inactivated vaccine, SER-ME (containing E. rhusiopathiae serovar 2a), was evaluated. All vaccinated pigs survived without any apparent clinical signs after lethal challenge with the Fujisawa reference strain or the variant. This indicates that the SER-ME vaccine effectively protects pigs against the infection of E. rhusiopathiae M203/I257 SpaA-type variant. Current vaccines in Japan, including SER-ME, suggest that outbreaks in Japan are unlikely caused by vaccine failure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The incidence of GC is lower in dogs than in humans, accounting for less than 1% of all canine malignancies. In recent years, efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis of GC and in find an appropriate therapy to maximize curative results, such as adjuvant chemotherapy treatments in addition to surgery. Although surgery is the first-line treatment, it is associated with several complications. In terms of chemotherapeutic intervention, canine gastric cancer has not received much attention, probably due to its late diagnosis, fast progression, low median survival time, and very high mortality rate, along with the lack of publications with concrete scientific results. In this review, we explore canine GC and the pharmacological approach used in the treatment of this often-fatal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease, which is endemic in Nigeria, lacks appropriate attention and national data. This review estimated the burden and distribution of human and animal brucellosis in Nigeria in the last twenty years (2001-2021). Publications reporting the detection of brucellosis in Nigeria were sorted from different search engines, including PubMed, ResearchGate, Scopus, and Google Scholar, to generate data on its prevalence, spatial distribution, and predisposing factors. The results of the national seroprevalence of human and animal brucellosis as revealed in this study were 17.6% (554/3144) and 13.3% (8547/64,435), respectively. Specifically, 15.8% (7178/45,363) seroprevalence of brucellosis was recorded in northern Nigeria as against 8.7% (1902/21,740) seroprevalence in the southern part. It also indicated that 78.7% of the detected brucellae were un-typed. The Brucella species detected were B. abortus (15.2%), B. melitensis (4%), B. suis (1.8%), and B. canis (0.4%). This study revealed that brucellosis is endemic in Nigeria. Culture and molecular methods for detecting brucellosis and reports on antimicrobial susceptibility testing remain a conjecture. This review will help researchers redirect their research focus and serve as a guide for policymakers on measures for managing brucellosis in Nigeria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in the severity of skin lesions and pruritus, and the overall efficacy of antimicrobial treatment, in dogs with AD and bacterial overgrowth/infection and/or Malassezia dermatitis. A total of 20 dogs with AD and SIs were prospectively enrolled (group A) and they were examined before and after the administration of systemic antimicrobials that resulted in the resolution of SIs. In addition, 19 dogs fulfilling the same inclusion criteria and treated with systemic, with or without topical antimicrobials, were included retrospectively (group B). Since there were no major differences between the groups, their results were combined. The severity of skin lesions decreased significantly, by 30% based on Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index-4 (CADESI-4), by 28.1% based on the erythema domain of CADESI-4 and based on owner's global assessment of the severity of skin lesions. Pruritus decreased significantly, by 34.7% based on the Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale (PVAS). The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment was assessed as good to excellent by the investigator and the owner in 55% and 60% of the dogs, respectively. Despite the significant improvement, there was high variability in the response to treatment among dogs. Further studies are needed to find factors that determine the response to antimicrobial treatment in dogs with AD and SIs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This parasite causes visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal leishmaniasis in people in the Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, South America, and West Asia. This disease is mostly unknown by veterinarians outside the endemic areas, but the disease is expanding in the Northern Hemisphere due to travel and climate change. New methodologies to study the epidemiology of the disease have found new hosts of leishmaniasis and drawn a completely new picture of the parasite biological cycle. Canine leishmaniasis diagnosis has evolved over the years through the analysis of new samples using novel molecular techniques. Given the neglected nature of leishmaniasis, progress in drug discovery is slow, and the few drugs that reach clinical stages in humans are unlikely to be commercialised for dogs, but several approaches have been developed to support chemotherapy. New-generation vaccines developed during the last decade are now widely used, along with novel prevention strategies. The implications of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of canine leishmaniasis are fundamental to public health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite its veterinary and medical importance, there is currently no available vaccine against this pathogen. In this study, the recombinant GP19 (rGP19) was produced and used as a recombinant vaccine prototype in a mouse model against experimental E. canis infection. The efficacy of the rGP19 vaccine prototype in the part of stimulating B and T cell responses and conferring protection in mice later challenged with E. canis pathogen were evaluated. The rGP19-specific antibody response was evaluated by ELISA after E. canis challenge exposure (on days 0, 7, and 14 post-challenge), and demonstrated significantly higher mean antibody levels in rGP19-immunized mice compared with adjuvant-immunized and naive mice. Significantly lower ehrlichial loads in blood, liver, and spleen DNA samples were detected in the immunized mice with rGP19 by qPCR. The up-regulation of IFNG and IL1 mRNA expression were observed in mice immunized with rGP19. In addition, this study detected IFN-&#947;-producing memory CD4+ T cells in the rGP19-immunized mice and later infected with E. canis on day 14 post-infection period using flow cytometry. The present study provided a piece of evidence that rGP19 may eliminate E. canis by manipulating Th1 and B cell roles and demonstrated a promising strategy in vaccine development against E. canis infection in the definitive host for further study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Utilizing this assay, we monitored decreases in the levels of tear film ceramides with short-chain fatty acids, hydroxy-ceramides, phytoceramides, and hydroxy-phytoceramides. Dihydroceramide levels were unaltered and increased levels of ceramides with long-chain fatty acids (24:0 and 24:1) were monitored in cattle with pink eye. The data from this pilot study (n = 8 controls and 8 pink eye) demonstrate a major disruption of the lipid tear film layer in pink eye disease, that can result in severe eye irritation and damage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 25 American Staffordshire Terrier dogs were selected and randomly assigned to two groups: control (CTR, n = 12) and treated (TRT, n = 13) groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding body weight, body condition score, and fecal score. No significant differences in microbiota/mycobiota, short chain fatty acids, indole/skatole, histamine, zonulin, or lactoferrin were detected. Indeed, supplementation with S. boulardii significantly decreased fecal calprotectin Immunoglobulin A, indicating an improvement in the gut well-being. Interestingly, fecal cortisol significantly decreased in dogs belonging to the TRT group compared to the CTR, suggesting both an improvement of the intestinal status and a reduction of stress, a common condition affecting animals managed in a breeding environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We investigated the effect of a spot-on containing plant-based essential fatty acids and essential oils on skin barrier parameters in a dog model of acute skin barrier disruption, using five healthy beagle dogs maintained in a laboratory setting. Four test sites on the dorsum and a control site on the abdomen were defined on each dog. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin surface hydration (SSH) were measured before and after tape stripping on the first day and then for three consecutive days, over four consecutive weeks. The spot-on was applied at the end of each of the first three weeks. The increase in TEWL after tape stripping was reduced after the spot-on application and reached control values in Weeks 3 and 4. SSH after tape stripping was reduced in Week 4 compared with the baseline. Thus, the ATOP 7[&#174;] spot-on significantly reduced acute skin barrier impairment in a dog model. The use of this product should be further evaluated as a potential treatment for skin barrier defects such as canine atopic dermatitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They are most often caused by non-genetic factors such as persistent deciduous canine teeth or trauma coinciding with the eruption of permanent teeth. Another factor may be mandible narrowing or underdevelopment in the transverse dimension and vestibular inclination of the maxillary canine teeth. This article presents a procedure based on three cases where the position of the mandibular canine tooth was corrected using human orthodontic appliances modified to affect the canine dental system. The incline of the appliance was made to stimulate the protrusion of the mandible while the teeth were closing. After approximately 4 weeks, the lower canine teeth moved along the incline of the appliance, and tilt toward the flews was achieved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In canine lymphoma cells, methylation due to inactivation of the p16 gene has been reported. However, its protein expression has not been examined in previous studies. In our in vitro study, the gene and protein expression of p16 and phosphorylated pRb were examined simultaneously in eight canine lymphoma and leukemia cell lines (17-71, CLBL-1, GL-1, CLC, CLGL-90, Ema, Nody-1, and UL-1). Methylation of the p16 gene was also explored using the demethylation drug 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). After 5-Aza treatment, p16 gene and protein expression increased and pRb phosphorylation decreased, suggesting that both hypermethylation of the p16 gene and pRb hyperphosphorylation occurred in four out of eight cell lines (CLBL-1, CLC, Nody-1, and UL-1). Moreover, the estimation of p16's protein expression was better than that of p16's mRNA expression because the expression of the protein was more stable than those of the gene, and highly related to the phosphorylation of pRb. These results revealed that p16's protein expression could be a promising biomarker for canine lymphoma cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of aromatase (Arom) and steroid receptors [estrogen receptor &#945; (ER &#945;), estrogen receptor &#946; (ER &#946;), progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR)] and intratumor steroid hormone levels of 17&#946;-estradiol (E2), estrone sulfate (SO4E1), progesterone (P4), androstenedione (A4), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone (T) in 78 samples of mammary cancer-51 human breast cancer (HBC) and 27 canine mammary cancer (CMC)-and corresponding controls. Frequency of tumors expressing Arom, ER&#946;, PR, and AR was similar in both species, whereas ER&#945;+ tumors were less frequent in the canine species. There was a closer similarity between premenopausal HBC and CMC. In HBC and CMC, all hormones assayed were increased in tumors compared to control samples. Intratumor androgen levels were similar in the two species, although levels of progesterone and estrogens were higher in the HBC samples than the CMC samples. Statistical associations among Arom, receptors, and hormones analyzed suggest that the major hormonal influence in both species is estrogenic through the ER, being the &#945; isoform predominant in the human samples. Our findings further support CMC as a spontaneous model for the study of HBC, especially premenopausal HBC, although several differences, such as the more prevalent ER&#945; immunoexpression and higher intratumor levels of estrogens and P4 in HBC, should be taken into account in comparative hormonal studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dogs are not only models of specific naturally occurring tumours but can also be sentinels of environmental exposures to carcinogens, as they share the same environment with their owners. The purpose of this work was to describe the data collected by The Italian Network of Laboratories for Veterinary Oncology in the first 9 years of activity (2013-2021) and to evaluate their potential epidemiological significance. Frequencies of tumour topographies and main morphologies in dogs were described, analysed and compared, calculating age-adjusted proportional morbidity ratios and considering several risk factors (breed, sex, period and region of residence). These observations allowed us to highlight differences not only in morphology and topography of some tumours but also to formulate hypotheses on the potential role of some risk factors, e.g., neutering/spaying or geographical location. In our opinion, the results of this case series confirm the importance of initiating and consolidating animal cancer registration initiatives that would facilitate the possibility of conducting multicentric collaborative studies to deepen the knowledge of the epidemiology of tumours in dogs from a comparative perspective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Knowledge of tolerance in the use of new drugs is, therefore, important to avoid severe toxicity in species, which are both commonly admitted in veterinary clinics and are of conservation concern. Antimalarial drugs have been developed for use in human medicine, but treatment with different agents has also long been used in avian medicine, as haemosporidian infections play a major role in many avian species. This study investigates the effects of the application of atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone[&#174;], GlaxoSmithKline) in common buzzards (Buteo buteo). The potential effects of treatment on body condition, growth rate, and chemical blood parameters of nestlings were assessed. All individuals survived the treatment, and no effects on body condition, growth rate, and chemical blood parameters were observed. Our results suggest the tolerability of Malarone[&#174;] in common buzzards at a single dose of on average 11 mg/kg body weight. For its safe use, we recommend further studies to determine pharmacokinetics in different avian species as well as to assess the effects of repeated treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006312</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prevalence, Diagnosis and Improving the Effectiveness of Therapy of Mastitis in Cows of Dairy Farms in East Kazakhstan.</Title>	<Abstract>In the present work, the prevalence, etiological factors and effective treatment scheme of mastitis in cows of dairy farms &#8220;Balke&#8221; and &#8220;Madi-R&#8221; in Eastern Kazakhstan were investigated. In total, 210 heads were investigated on two farms. The incidence of mastitis in cows on dairy farms is not the same in different years. Average clinical mastitis was detected in 35.4% of cows in 2016, 19.6% in 2017, 28.5% in 2018, and in 2019 in 16.4% of cows. The prevalence rates of subclinical mastitis by year had some differences. So, in 2016&#8212;36.5% of cows, then in 2017&#8212;21.5%, 2018&#8212;19.3% and in 2019&#8212;22.6%. In cows with udder inflammation, serum calcium 9.37 &#177; 0.15 mg/% with a range of 8.0 to 10.8 mg/%, phosphorus 3.58 &#177; 0.07 mg/% (3.0 to 4.3 mg/%), reserve alkalinity 363.46 &#177; 6.69 mg/% (320 to 440), carotene 0.49 &#177; 0.03 mg/% (0.220 to 0.988 mg/%), which are in the lower limit of physiological parameters. The drug &#8220;Dorob&#8221; was tested during the study of comparative effectiveness of treatment methods. The results of the study showed that this drug has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and stimulating healing actions. The treatment of the sick cows with catarrhal mastitis has shown that a total of 8 cows have recovered in the control group and 10 cows in the experimental group with the preparation &#8220;Dorob&#8221;. The period of recovery in the control group was 8.8 &#177; 0.39, and in the experimental group&#8212;6.2 &#177; 0.28 (p &lt; 0.05). The drug does not contain antibiotics and hormonal preparations. The inclusion of the drug in the scheme of treatment allows for effectively treating inflammatory processes in the udder of cows and restoring their productivity with minimal cost of time and money.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This was a prospective observational study. The RVE was defined by echocardiography. The amplitude (mV) of the Q, R, and S waves, the R/S ratio, and the mean electrical axis (MEA) of the QRS complex were assessed on the 12-lead ECG. The ROC curve and the Youden index yielded the best cutoffs for RVE detection. An area under the curve (AUC) &gt; 0.7 defined suitable diagnostic accuracy. A total of 84 dogs, 27 with RVE and 57 healthy controls, were enrolled. Q wave amplitude in aVR (cutoff &gt; 0.10 mV; AUC = 0.727), R/S ratio in V4 (cutoff &lt; 1.15; AUC = 0.842), R/S ratio in V5 (cutoff &lt; 1.95; AUC = 0.839) and S wave amplitude in V6 (cutoff &gt; 0.70 mV; AUC = 0.703) showed suitable diagnostic accuracy in detecting RVE. Among dogs with RVE, only 9/27 (33%) presented a right shift of MEA. Differently, 19/27 (70%) showed at least one of the identified precordial lead criteria. Assessment of the R/S ratio in V4 and V5 and S wave amplitude in V6 increases the diagnostic accuracy of ECG in distinguishing between dogs with RVE and healthy dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human clinics, FMT has been used for treating diseases for decades, with promising results. In recent years, veterinary specialists adapted FMT in canine patients; however, compared to humans, canine FMT is more inclined towards research purposes than practical applications in most cases, due to safety concerns. Therefore, in order to facilitate the application of fecal transplant therapy in dogs, in this paper, we review recent applications of FMT in canine clinical treatments, as well as possible mechanisms that are involved in the process of the therapeutic effect of FMT. More research is needed to explore more effective and safer approaches for conducting FMT in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In May 2019, a 13-year-old neutered European Shorthair male was referred due to weight loss and exfoliative dermatitis. Lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly were detected upon clinical inspection, while the presence of several Leishmania infantum amastigotes were detected on splenic and lymphonodal fine needle aspiration (FNA). Allopurinol (10 mg/kg PO q 12 h) was administered. After two months, the cat's clinical symptoms disappeared, and the owners decided to interrupt the therapy. In February, two reddish nodular fleshy neoformations appeared in both eyes, and amastigotes of Leishmania were detected by cytology on conjunctival swabs. Allopurinol treatment was re-started at the same rate; the ocular lesions regressed in two weeks, and the owner again decided to interrupt the therapy. In July, the patient had a new relapse, but the owner, tired of continuous relapses, refused further treatment of the disease. The cat's health condition continued to worsen: in October 2021, the ocular lesions appeared again, and in November the patient died. This case underlines the effectiveness of allopurinol and highlights how interruption of treatment frequently leads to relapse, impairing the animal's health condition and prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006316</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison between Some Phenotypic and Genotypic Methods for Assessment of Antimicrobial Resistance Trend of Bovine Mastitis Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from Bulgaria.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of this study was to assess the resistance of bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates from farms in Bulgaria to different classes of chemotherapeutic drugs by comparison of some phenotypic and genotypic methods by means of Cohen's kappa statistics. The study comprised 546 milk samples from subclinical and clinical mastitis at 14 farms from 9 districts in the country. A total of 92 Staphylococcus aureus strains were isolated from tested samples and identified by nuc PCR. The results demonstrated high levels of resistance to sulfadimethoxine (87%), followed by resistance to penicillin (33.7%), erythromycin (13%), streptomycin (8.7%), tetracycline (6.5%) and gentamicin (1.1%). The comparison of both phenotypic tests with respect to 9 antimicrobials revealed strong agreement with kappa coefficient 0.836. An almost complete agreement was evidenced between phenotypic resistance to penicillin and blaZ gene presence, to methicillin with mecA gene, to tetracycline with tet genes, but the agreement between erythromycin resistance and erm genes presence was moderate. This study was the first to demonstrate discrepancy between the behaviour to cefoxitin in the disk diffusion test and oxacillin in the MIC test for an isolate shown to carry the mecA gene in the subsequent genetic analysis. Considering the detected discrepancies for some of isolates, an integral evaluation through phenotypic and molecular methods for monitoring of antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006317</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Ovarian Neuroglial Choristoma in a Bitch.</Title>	<Abstract>Neuroglial choristomas are rare malformations consisting of heterotopic mature neural tissue at a site isolated from the brain or spinal cord. In human medicine, neuroglial choristomas are predominantly reported in the head and in the neck, except for one recent case reported in a foot of a child. In domestic animals, neuroglial choristomas are exceedingly rare, reported only in the retina of a dog, in the pharynx and in the skin of two kittens, and within the oropharynx of a harbor seal. A three-year-old intact female Jack Russell Terrier presented for elective ovariectomy exhibited a cystic lesion 2 cm in diameter expanding in the right ovary. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a mass composed of well-organized neuroglial tissue. Immunohistochemistry with primary antibodies against GFAP, NSE, and IBA-1 confirmed the neuroglial origin of the mass. At the time of this writing, 7 years after ovariectomy, the dog was clinically normal. Together with a recent case described in the foot of a child, this case confirms that neuroglial choristoma may also be found far from the skull or spine, supporting the hypothesis that they may arise from an early embryological migration defect.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006318</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Green Tea Extract in the Extender Improved the Post-Thawed Semen Quality and Decreased Amino Acid Mutation of Kacang Buck Sperm.</Title>	<Abstract>This study was the first to combine the addition of antioxidants to a skim milk-egg yolk (SM-EY) extender and different equilibration periods to obtain higher quality post-thawed Kacang buck semen. This study aimed to determine the effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the quality of frozen Kacang goat sperm equilibrated for one and two hours. The pool of Kacang buck ejaculate was equally divided into four portions and was diluted in an SM-EY extender that contained four doses of 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 mg of GTE/100 mL for T0, T1, T2, and T3 groups, respectively. The aliquots were treated for an equilibration period of 1-2 h before further processing as frozen semen. Post-thawed semen quality was evaluated for sperm quality. The Sanger method was used for DNA sequencing, and the amino acid sequence was read using MEGA v.7.0. The post-thawed semen of the T2 group that was equilibrated for one hour had the highest semen quality. Pre-freezing motility had the highest determination coefficient compared to post-thawed sperm motility. This study is the first to report amino acid mutation due to freeze-thawing. The frequency of amino acid mutations revealed that T2 was the least mutated amino acid. Glycine, valine, leucine, serine, and asparagine strongly correlated to post-thawed sperm motility. It can be concluded that a combination of 0.1 mg GTE/100 mL extender as an antioxidant and one-hour equilibration period resulted in the best post-thawed Kacang buck semen quality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hand2os1 is an lncRNA located upstream of Hand2, with which a bidirectional promoter is shared and is involved in the regulation of cardiac development and embryo implantation in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and regulation of Hand2os1 in the ovaries. Here, we used RNAscope to detect differential expression of Hand2os1 in the ovaries of cycling and pregnant mice. Hand2os1 was specifically detected in luteal cells during the proestrus and estrus phases, showing its highest expression in the corpus luteum at estrus. Additionally, Hand2os1 was strongly expressed in the corpus luteum on day 4 of pregnancy, but the positive signal progressively disappeared after day 8, was detected again on day 18, and gradually decreased after delivery. Hand2os1 significantly promoted the synthesis of progesterone and the expression of StAR and Cyp11a1. The decreased progesterone levels caused by Hand2os1 interference were rescued by the overexpression of StAR. Our findings suggest that Hand2os1 may regulate the secretion of progesterone in the mouse corpus luteum by affecting the key rate-limiting enzyme StAR, which may have an impact on the maintenance of pregnancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This bacterial genus is classified into several serovars/lineages, some of them showing high antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The ease of Salmonella transmission in farms, slaughterhouses, and eggs industries has made controlling it a real challenge in the poultry-production chains. This review describes the emergence, dissemination, and AMR of the main Salmonella serovars and lineages detected in Brazilian poultry. It is reported that few serovars emerged and have been more widely disseminated in breeders, broilers, and layers in the last 70 years. Salmonella Gallinarum was the first to spread on the farms, remaining as a concerning poultry pathogen. Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis were also largely detected in poultry and foods (eggs, chicken, turkey), being associated with several human foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella Heidelberg and Minnesota have been more widely spread in recent years, resulting in frequent chicken/turkey meat contamination. A few more serovars (Infantis, Newport, Hadar, Senftenberg, Schwarzengrund, and Mbandaka, among others) were also detected, but less frequently and usually in specific poultry-production regions. AMR has been identified in most isolates, highlighting multi-drug resistance in specific poultry lineages from the serovars Typhimurium, Heidelberg, and Minnesota. Epidemiological studies are necessary to trace and control this pathogen in Brazilian commercial poultry production chains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

First, to determine the optimum WC dose, newly hatched broiler chick groups (n = 10) were untreated or consecutively given WC (0.005%, 0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.1%) and AM until slaughter (31 days of age). At day 21, all chicks were infected with coccidia. From the economical and practical viewpoints, 0.03% WC supplementation was the best dose. Second, newly hatched broiler chick groups (n = 10) were untreated or given 0.03% WC and AM. Each group was run in triplicate. At day 21, two chicks/pen with the farthest body weights as per the group's mean body weight were spared, and the remaining inoculated with coccidia. At days 42 and 49, the WC and AM groups had significantly greater body weights and daily weight gains. Intestinal lesion scores were lower in 29-day-old AM and WC. Oocyst numbers were lower in 29- and 49-day-old AM and WC, but only 29- and 49-day-old AM had higher Escherichia coli levels. To conclude, although WC and AM induced similar growth performance in coccidium-infected chicks, unlike AM, the E. coli levels did not increase with WC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There are no studies about ultrasonographic appearance of the pancreas with EPI in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe ultrasound features of the pancreas during EPI in this species. Dogs with history and clinical signs of maldigestion, serum canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI) values &lt;5 &#181;g/L, and abdominal ultrasound exam were included in the study. Size, shape, margin, echogenicity, echostructure, and pancreatic duct appearance of the right pancreatic lobe were valued. Additional sonographic intestinal findings were recorded. Thirty-four dogs were included. The mean pancreatic thickness in our population was significantly lower than the mean reference values of healthy dogs. In 68% of dogs, the pancreas had a normal ultrasound appearance. Ultrasonographic intestinal abnormal findings were identified in 85% of dogs and were suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that EPI is a functional diagnosis, ultrasound evaluation should be considered among the useful tests. The finding of a normal but thinned pancreas associated with sonographic intestinal signs of inflammatory bowel disease in dogs with typical history and supportive clinical signs could suggest a diagnosis of EPI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An observational, in field multicentric study was performed, aiming to evaluate the tolerability and the long-term prevention of Afilaria SR in Italy, a country where filariasis is endemic. The study was designed to include not less than 300 dogs, older than 6 months, of any breed. Side effects were recorded by veterinarians and antigenic tests were performed after 210, 365, 730, and 1095 days after the administration of the drug. A total of 583 dogs were recruited from 2018 to 2021 and all of them were negative with respect to antigenic tests at all time points, indicating that 100% of protection was achieved. Ranking of adverse reactions and correlation to patient features were analyzed using descriptive statistics and &#967;2 square test, respectively. Afilaria SR was well tolerated: 13% of dogs experienced mild reactions and only two dogs out of 583 (0.3%) demonstrated anaphylactoid/angioneurotic reactions, resolved administering corticosteroids. These data support that Afilaria SR prevented Dirofilaria immitis disease in all enrolled dogs and the low number and the low grade of side effects indicate the high safety profile of the product.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the current study, the gut microbiome profile of dogs diagnosed with advanced stages of multicentric lymphoma was compared with that of healthy dogs and analyzed. For this purpose, dogs from veterinary hospitals diagnosed with lymphoma were selected and were further narrowed down to cases of stage IV multicentric lymphoma. Fecal samples from the selected sick and healthy dogs were collected and analyzed using MiSeq sequencing. The gut microbiota in the two groups of dogs was statistically analyzed and compared. The results revealed significant differences in the microbial populations present in sick and healthy dogs. Phylum Actinobacteria and two species (Corynebacterium amycolatum and Streptococcus lutetiensis) were found in high proportions in sick dogs and may be considered as potential biomarkers for canine stage IV multicentric lymphoma. Further investigations need to be conducted to understand the mechanisms they might be involved in.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of immunocastration on animal welfare in heavy pig production through the evaluation of behaviour and body lesions. A total of 188 commercial-hybrid pigs were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: surgical castration (SC) and immunocastration with Improvac[&#174;] (IC). Data on behaviour, body lesions, and salivary testosterone levels were collected the day before each vaccination at 15, 22, 32, and 36 weeks of age. IC and SC pigs were slaughtered at 40 and 41 weeks of age, respectively; productive and carcass traits data were also collected. Considering productive performance, our results confirmed that IC pigs grew faster and presented a higher weight at slaughter. A critical period for pig welfare was observed before 32 weeks: testosterone concentration and body lesion score were significantly higher in IC pigs compared to SC pigs; active behaviours were significantly more frequent in IC at 15 weeks. Immunocastration may represent a suitable alternative to surgical castration with profitable productive performances, whereas the impairment of welfare during the period before the effective vaccination should be further investigated as a potential critical aspect in heavy pig production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, studies on RAS inhibition with a single agent have not shown consistent anticancer effects, potentially due to the neoplastic cells utilizing alternative pathways for RAS activation. To achieve more complete RAS inhibition, multimodal therapy with several medications that simultaneously block multiple steps in the RAS has been developed for use in humans. In the present study, the safety of multimodal RAS inhibition using atenolol, benazepril, metformin, curcumin, and meloxicam was assessed in six cats with squamous cell carcinomas. Cats were treated for 8 weeks, with blood pressure measured and blood sampled five times during the treatment period. None of the cats developed hypotension, azotemia, or increased serum liver enzyme concentrations. The packed cell volume of one cat decreased to just below the reference range during treatment. One cat was reported to have increased vomiting, although this occurred infrequently. One cat was withdrawn from the study due to difficulties administering the medications, and another cat died of an unrelated cause. Two cats were euthanatized during the study period due to cancer progression. Two cats completed the 8-week study period. One was subsequently euthanized due to cancer progression while the other cat is still alive 32 weeks after entering the study and is still receiving the multimodal blockade of the RAS. This is the first evaluation of multimodal blockade of the RAS in veterinary species. The study showed that the treatment is safe, with only mild adverse effects observed in two treated cats. Due to the small number of cats, the efficacy of treatment could not be evaluated. However, evidence from human studies suggests that a multimodal blockade of RAS could be a safe and cost-effective treatment option for cancer in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006327</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Identification of Parasitic Protozoa Sarcocystis in Water Samples.</Title>	<Abstract>Sarcocystis parasites are among the most common parasitic protozoa in farm animals. So far, the diversity of these parasites has been mainly studied in animal carcasses by morphological or molecular methods. Research on parasitic protozoa in environmental samples is scarce due to the lack of an appropriate methodology and low concentrations of parasites. For these reasons, there is a paucity of validated methods for Sarcocystis identification from environmental samples. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate various molecular methods for Sarcocystis parasite identification in water samples. In the present study, the sample volume, sporocysts isolation, and various conventional PCR were evaluated, and species-specific primers for the identification of different Sarcocystis species have been developed. Of the methods studied, based on data the most appropriate method for the identification of analyzed Sarcocystis spp. in water bodies is nested PCR, using species-specific primers targeting the cox1 gene. Sarcocystis DNA was detected in 111 out of 114 (97.4%) samples. This paper represents the first identification of S. bovifelis, S. cruzi, S. hirsuta, S. arieticanis, S. tenella, S. capracanis, S. bertrami, and S. miescheriana by PCR and sequencing in environmental water samples. Our pilot study is useful in developing techniques for the identification of Sarcocystis species from water samples.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Furthermore, deficiencies in feed microbiology are suspected to trigger gastrointestinal and liver disorders in horses, but the connection needs further clarification. Most of the previous studies regarding horse feed hygiene focused on forage, whereas research regarding hygienic quality of concentrates is scarce. In the present study, results of reports on hygienic quality of compound feed and cereals for horses were evaluated secondarily. Results included sensory findings, and counts of aerobic bacteria, molds and yeasts determined by cultivation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contents. It was found that microbial counts of compound feed exceeded VDLUFA orientation values significantly more frequently than cereals (38.4 vs. 22.6%). However, average counts of bacteria, molds and yeasts were higher in cereals than in compound feeds (p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Mold counts in grains were significantly higher if dry matter contents were below 86% (p = 0.0201). No relation could be established between the anamnestically reported gastrointestinal disorders or elevated liver enzyme activities and microbiological deviations. Mold counts of concentrates which were suspected to cause coughing in horses were significantly higher than mold counts of control samples (3.29 vs. 2.40 log10 cfu g&#8722;1, p = 0.0313). These results indicate that hygienic status of concentrates is relevant for horse health in the respiratory tract.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006329</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison of Low- and High-Cost Infrared Thermal Imaging Devices for the Detection of Lameness in Dairy Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Lameness has a high economic cost to the U.K. dairy industry; accurate and early detection of lameness minimises this cost. Infrared thermal imaging (IRT) devices have shown promising results for use as a lameness detection aid in cattle when used in research settings; these devices are typically high-cost, limiting their adoption. This study analysed the effectiveness of low-cost IRT devices (LCDs) as lameness detection aids, by comparing both maximum environmentally adjusted temperature values and hindfeet temperature difference collected by an LCD to the mobility score of the cow; this test was repeated for data collected by a research-specification device. Data collection occurred during routine milking of 83 cattle; each cow's mobility was scored afterwards. Significant differences were found between lame and sound cows with the LCD, upon analysis of both methods. There was no significant difference between the data captured by differing devices. The maximum sensitivity and specificity values for the LCD were calculated as 66.95 and 64.53, respectively, compared with 70.34 and 70.94, respectively, for the research-specification device; optimum threshold values for these were equivalent for both devices, suggesting IRT lameness identification is not device-dependent. It was concluded that a minimal difference in effectiveness between tested devices suggests that LCDs could be used as a lameness detection aid; consequently, there is potential for widespread adoption as on-farm detection aids.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four Thai native sheep with an initial body weight (BW) of 20.87 &#177; 1.95 kg and 11 &#177; 1.0 months old were assigned to a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 14-d adaptation and 7 d of sample collection. Each treatment received a different combination of experimental roughage as follows: FSB without additives (T1), FSB + 10% molasses (T2), FSB + 20% molasses (T3), and FSB + 10% molasses + 3% urea (T4). The concentrate diet was fed twice daily at 2% BW, while roughage sources were provided ad libitum for each treatment. The crude protein (CP) digestibility in the T2 and T3 groups was higher (p &lt; 0.05) than in the FSB group without additions, with the T4 group having the highest (p &lt; 0.05). Although there were no significant differences in blood glucose, packed cell volume, ruminal pH, ammonia&#8722;nitrogen (NH3-N), propionic acid, or acetic acid, the plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) at 0 h was highest in the T4 group (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the other groups. However, the proportion of butyric acid tended to be higher in all FSB groups with additives. Thus, the current experiment concluded that the addition of molasses alone or in combination with urea had positive effects on pH and LAB population, and including both together in FSB improved the CP digestibility of sheep. In conclusion, FSB with 10% molasses and 3% urea might be used as an alternate roughage source for ruminants without affecting the animal&#8217;s ruminal fermentation or hematological parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006331</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Predictive Models of Dairy Cow Thermal State: A Review from a Technological Perspective.</Title>	<Abstract>Dairy cattle are particularly sensitive to heat stress due to the higher metabolic rate needed for milk production. In recent decades, global warming and the increase in dairy production in warmer countries have stimulated the development of a wide range of environmental control systems for dairy farms. Despite their proven effectiveness, the associated energy and water consumption can compromise the viability of dairy farms in many regions, due to the cost and scarcity of these resources. To make these systems more efficient, they should be activated in time to prevent thermal stress and switched off when that risk no longer exists, which must consider environmental variables as well as the variables of the animals themselves. Nowadays, there is a wide range of sensors and equipment that support farm routine procedures, and it is possible to measure several variables that, with the aid of algorithms based on predictive models, would allow anticipating animals' thermal states. This review summarizes three types of approaches as predictive models: bioclimatic indexes, machine learning, and mechanistic models. It also focuses on the application of the current knowledge as algorithms to be used in the management of diverse types of environmental control systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the ASFV E248R gene was selected to be the target for establishing a real-time PCR method. TaqMan real-time PCR for the detection of ASFV E248R gene did not cross-react with other porcine viruses that could cause similar symptoms. The results of the repeatability test showed that the coefficients of variation between and within groups were lower than 1.977%. This method can be used for the rapid detection and early diagnosis of ASF. Meanwhile, the recombinant PRRS virus (PRRSV)-expressing E248R gene of ASFV was constructed and rescued by using the reverse genetic platform of live-attenuated PRRSV vaccine. The ASFV E248R gene can be detected by using this real-time PCR detection method, confirming that the ASFV E248R gene could be stably amplified in PRRSV genome at least 20 cell passages. The detection methods can be used for the efficient detection of the ASFV infection and recombinant PRRSV live vector virus-expressing ASFV antigen protein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Maca is an herbaceous plant rich in protein, crude oil, essential acids, and pharmacological compounds. Maca has positive effects on different health parameters. In this study, the effect of adding Maca powder to the diets of young and old laying quails at the end of the 10-week trial was investigated. In total, 150 laying Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) (209.1 &#177; 10.0 g) were randomly distributed to a 2 &#215; 3 factorial arrangement with two ages (10 weeks and 30 weeks) and three Maca powder levels (0, 1, or 2 g/kg), with five subgroups per treatment. According to the study, eggshell quality, total cholesterol, triglyceride, progesterone, and testosterone concentrations of serum were lower in old quail than in young quail, while egg weight, feed intake, and follicle-stimulating hormone increased significantly as quail aged. (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, aging negatively affected the histomorphology of the ileum and cortical bone thickness (p &lt; 0.05). Additional findings show that adding 1 g/kg Maca powder to the diet of quail significantly improved eggshell, ileum, and bone traits that deteriorate with age, without affecting performance, and adding 2 g/kg Maca powder to the diet significantly reduced serum total cholesterol levels (p &lt; 0.05). Incorporating Maca powder into the diet of aged birds could reduce the negative effects of aging.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasonography reports of cats presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between October 2018 and February 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Cats showing adrenomegaly (one or both glands having a dorsoventral axis &gt;4.8 mm) were selected and medical records respectively evaluated. Nine-hundred and eighty-three ultrasonographical reports were selected, of which, 68 (7%) disclosed adrenomegaly. European/Domestic Short-Hair (62/68; 91%) male (44/68; 65%) castrated (35/44; 80%) cats were overrepresented. Adrenomegaly was an incidental finding in 62/68 (91%) cats while in 6/68 (9%) it was identified in the context of investigating a potential adrenal disease. Concerning established diagnosis, chronic kidney disease was overrepresented (25/68; 37%), followed by endocrinopathies (20/68; 29%). Adrenomegaly was bilateral in 53% (36/68) of cases. In unilateral cases (32/68; 47%), it was more prevalent on the left side (23/32; 72%), with a normal-sized contralateral adrenal gland. Left adrenal demonstrated a larger size and a tendency to oval shape. This study assesses the prevalence of adrenomegaly in clinically ill cats, reinforcing it can be an incidental ultrasound finding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Previous veterinary studies have demonstrated that changes in these values are detectable in multiple canine cancer patients. However, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, no studies have yet demonstrated an increase in LDH in canine oral malignant melanoma patients, nor has the effect of metastasis on LDH levels been explored. This retrospective pilot study included 18 dogs, of which 10 were healthy controls, 5 OMM patients with metastasis and 3 without metastasis. Serum LDH was measured and pre-treatment peripheral leucocyte ratios were calculated. LDH was measurable within all patient groups and a statistically significant difference in LDH levels was detected between patients with OMM and healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05); however, no significant difference was detected between patients with or without metastatic disease. This study suggests that serum LDH levels are significantly increased in dogs with OMM compared to healthy controls, paving the way for further research to investigate the prognostic value of this biomarker.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

According to the results of a previous analysis of the therapeutic use of amphibians in Spain, we decided to carry out a histological study that provides a complementary view of their ethnopharmacology, through the natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita). This species possesses a characteristic integument, where the parotoid glands stand out, and it has been used in different ethnoveterinary and ethnomedical practices. This histological study of their glandular variability allow us to understand the stages through which the animal synthesises and stores a heterogeneous glandular content according to the areas of the body and the functional moment of the glands. To study tegumentary cytology, a high-resolution, plastic embedding, semi-thin (1 micron) section method was applied. Up to 20 skin patches sampled from the dorsal and ventral sides were processed from the two adult specimens collected, which were roadkill. Serous/venom glands display a genetic and biochemical complexity, leading to a cocktail that remains stored (and perhaps changes over time) until extrusion, but mucous glands, working continuously to produce a surface protection layer, also produce a set of active protein (and other) substances that dissolve into mucous material, making a biologically active covering. This study provides a better understanding of the use of traditional remedies in ethnoveterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Samples of ascending, thoracic and abdominal aorta were processed for histological and morphometric studies. The elastic component was higher in the proximal aortic segments, and the muscular elements increased distally in all cases. Morphometric analyses showed that all families presented a decrease in the thickness of the arterial wall and the tunica media along the aorta. The reduction was dramatic between ascending and thoracic aorta in the Physeteridae specimens; meanwhile, the other three families showed a more uniform decrease between the ascending, thoracic and abdominal aorta. The decline was not correlated with a reduced elastic or lamellar unit thickness but with a loss of lamellar units. The organization of the elements in the aortic wall did not show essential modifications between the four families, resembling the structure described previously in the shallow and intermediate diving dolphins. Our findings support that the difference in the morphometric characteristics of the different segments in the aortic wall is likely related to the diving habit more than the absolutes values of any other parameter.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, 407 aborted-fetus samples were obtained from 89 pig farms in Hunan province, to investigate the prevalence of four viruses associated with porcine reproductive disease, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Meanwhile, the target gene sequences of representative PRRSV (ORF5), PCV2 (ORF2), CSFV (E2), and PRV (gE) strains were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The results showed that the positive rates of PRRSV, PCV2, PRV, and CSFV among the collected samples were 26.29% (107/407), 52.83% (215/407), 6.39% (26/407), and 12.29% (50/407), respectively. Moreover, co-infection with two and three pathogens were frequently identified, with PCV2/PRRSV, PRRSV/CSFV, PRRSV/PRV, PCV2/CSFV, PCV2/PRV, and PRRSV/PCV2/CSFV mix infection rates of 9.09%, 3.19%, 2.95%, 3.69%, 2.21%, and 0.49%, respectively. Moreover, ORF5-based phylogenetic analysis showed that 9, 4, and 24 of 37 PRRSV strains belonged to the PRRSV2 lineages 1, 5, and 8, respectively. ORF2-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that PCV2d and PCV2b were prevalent in Hunan province, with the proportions of 87.5% (21/24) and 12.5% (3/24), respectively. An E2-based phylogenetic tree showed that all 13 CSFV strains were clustered with 2.1 subgenotypes, these isolates were composed of 2.1b (10/13) and 2.1c (3/13) sub-subgenotypes. A gE-based phylogenetic tree showed that all six PRV strains belonged to the genotype II, which were genetically closer to variant PRV strains. Collectively, the present study provides the latest information on the epidemiology and genotype diversity of four viruses in sows with reproductive diseases in Hunan province, China, which would contribute to developing effective strategies for disease control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Further, the objective was to determine if horses with high titre results were shedding Leptospira in their urine. Blood samples were collected from twelve horses located on or next to the farm with the outbreak in alpacas, on day zero and at four subsequent time points (two, four, six and nine weeks). The microscopic agglutination test was used to test sera for five serovars endemic in New Zealand: Ballum, Copenhageni, Hardjo, Pomona and Tarassovi. A reciprocal MAT titre cut-off of &#8805;1:100 was used to determine positive horses. Seven out of twelve horses (58%) were positive to at least one serovar during one of the time points. Two horses recorded titres of &#8805;1600, one for both Pomona and Copenhageni and the other for Hardjo, and these two horses were both PCR positive for Leptospira in their urine samples. For five out of seven horses, the titres either remained the same or changed by one dilution across the sampling time points. The study confirmed endemic exposure to five endemic Leptospira serovars in New Zealand in a group of horses located near a confirmed leptospirosis outbreak in alpacas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objectives of this retrospective study are to report the time to progression and survival times of a group of dogs with histologically confirmed intracranial gliomas treated with surgical debulking and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy. All cases treated in a single referral veterinary hospital from 2014 to 2021 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria comprised a histopathological diagnosis of intracranial glioma, adjunctive chemotherapy, and follow-up until death. Cases were excluded if the owner declined chemotherapy or there was insufficient follow-up information in the clinical records. Fourteen client-owned dogs were included with a median time to progression (MTP) of 156 days (95% CI 133-320 days) and median survival time (MST) of 240 days (95% CI 149-465 days). Temozolomide was the first-line adjuvant chemotherapy but changed to another chemotherapy agent (lomustine, toceranib phosphate, or melphalan) when tumour relapse was either suspected by clinical signs or confirmed by advanced imaging. Of the fourteen dogs, three underwent two surgical resections and one, three surgeries. Survival times (ST) were 241, 428, and 468 days for three dogs treated twice surgically and 780 days for the dog treated surgically three times. Survival times for dogs operated once was 181 days. One case was euthanized after developing aspiration pneumonia, and all other cases after progression of clinical signs due to suspected or confirmed tumour relapse. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are well-tolerated options in dogs with intracranial gliomas in which surgery is a possibility and should be considered a potential treatment option. Repeated surgery may be considered for selected cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 100 adult brown female mink (Mustela vison) were randomly and equally allocated to control group (C group), in which mink were fed basal diet and Spirulina group (Sp group), where mink received basal diet supplemented with 100 mg of Spirulina/kg of body weight. The experiment lasted 5 months, starting from 1 month prior to mating till kit weaning. Weight gain during pre-mating period was higher in Sp group compared to C group (p &lt; 0.001). Sp group remained heavier until the onset of lactation. Subsequently, mink of Sp group lost more weight than C group (p &lt; 0.001) but without an adverse effect on kit survival. A tendency for a higher whelping rate was detected in Sp group (93.61%) compared to C group (81.25%) (p = 0.07). Litter size, as well as weight of kits at weaning, did not differ between groups (p &gt; 0.10). Finally, Sp group weaned numerically more kits compared to C group. Results obtained here showed that Spirulina treated animals tended to an increased whelping rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this review was to evaluate the current scientific outcomes on these four neurological diseases and on their physiotherapy approaches. From the analysis of the published articles, it emerged that intervertebral disc herniation can be treated, with different rates of success, through a conservative or a surgical approach followed by physiotherapy. The literature is generally oriented toward the efficacy of the rehabilitation approach in this specific canine disease, often proposing intensive post-surgery physiotherapy for the most severe conditions with the absence of deep pain perception. When degenerative myelopathy, fibrocartilaginous embolism or polyradiculoneuritis occur, the existing literature supports the use of a physiotherapeutic approach: allowing a delay in the onset and worsening of the clinical signs in degenerative myelopathy, physical improvement, and, sometimes, complete remission during fibrocartilaginous embolism or acute idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis. However, papers on rehabilitation in dogs affected by polyradiculoneuritis are currently limited to single clinical cases and further blinded, controlled, prospective studies are still advisable for all four neurological diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006345</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Biofilm Producing Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci Isolated from Bulk Tank Milk.</Title>	<Abstract>Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are considered less virulent as they do not produce a large number of toxic enzymes and toxins; however, they have been increasingly recognized as an important cause of bovine mastitis. In particular, the ability to form biofilms appears to be an important factor in CoNS pathogenicity, and it contributes more resistance to antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenic potential by assessing the biofilm-forming ability of CoNS isolated from normal bulk tank milk using the biofilm formation assay and to analyze the biofilm-associated resistance to antimicrobial agents using the disc diffusion method. One hundred and twenty-seven (78.4%) among 162 CoNS showed the ability of biofilm formation, and all species showed a significantly high ability of biofilm formation (p &lt; 0.05). Although the prevalence of weak biofilm formers (39.1% to 80.0%) was significantly higher than that of other biofilm formers in all species (p &lt; 0.05), the prevalence of strong biofilm formers was significantly higher in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (36.4%), Staphylococcus chromogenes (24.6%), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (21.7%) (p &lt; 0.05). Also, 4 (11.4%) among 35 non-biofilm formers did not harbor any biofilm-associated genes, whereas all 54 strong or moderate biofilm formers harbored 1 or more of these genes. The prevalence of MDR was significantly higher in biofilm formers (73.2%) than in non-formers (20.0%) (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the distribution of MDR in strong or moderate biofilm formers was 81.5%, which was significantly higher than in weak (67.1%) and non-formers (20.0%) (p &lt; 0.05). Our results indicated that various CoNS isolated from bulk tank milk, not from bovine with mastitis, have already showed a high ability to form biofilms, while also displaying a high prevalence of MDR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present case series describes the transvenous right jugular embolization of PDA using an Amplatzer Vascular Plug II in seven dogs of different ages, breeds, and body weights. Complete closure of the PDA was demonstrated in all cases. All dogs showed significant hemodynamic reduction of pulmonary overcirculation and left heart size after the procedure and at following echocardiographic check-ups. Transjugular PDA occlusion using an Amplatzer Vascular Plug II can thus be considered as a safe alternative to the arterial or venous femoral approach using an Amplatzer canine ductal occluder (ACDO), particularly in puppies with small femoral vessels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent technology has offered the wearable wireless sensor of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for determining gait parameters. This study proposed the use of a triaxial IMU, comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer, for detecting three-dimensional limb segment motion (XYZ axis) during the gait cycle in Asian elephants. A new algorithm was developed to estimate the kinematic parameter that represents each limb segment of the forelimbs and hindlimbs while walking at a comfortable speed. For future use, this study aimed to create a new prototype of the IMU with a configuration that is tailored to the elephant and apply machine learning in an effort to achieve greater precision.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Genetic changes, or mutations, that give rise to a pathology in most cases result from recessive alleles that are normally found with minority allelic frequency. The use of genetic improvement increases the consanguinity within canine breeds and, on many occasions, also increases the frequency of these recessive alleles, increasing the prevalence of these pathologies. This prevalence has been known for a long time, but mutations differ according to the canine breed. These genetic diseases, including skin diseases, or genodermatosis, which is narrowly defined as monogenic hereditary dermatosis. In this review, we focus on genodermatosis sensu estricto, i.e., monogenic, and hereditary dermatosis, in addition to the clinical features, diagnosis, pathogeny, and treatment. Specifically, this review analyzes epidermolytic and non-epidermolytic ichthyosis, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, nasal parakeratosis, mucinosis, dermoid sinus, among others, in canine breeds, such as Golden Retriever, German Pointer, Australian Shepherd, American Bulldog, Great Dane, Jack Russell Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Shar-Pei, and Rhodesian Ridgeback.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Annual means for conception status, defined as the inverse of the number of inseminations to conception in percent, decreased from 55.6 for cows born in 1983 to 46.5 for cows born in 2018. Mean estimated breeding values increased by 1.8% for cow born in 1981 to cows born in 2018. Phenotypic records from 1988 to 2016 for the nine Israeli breeding index traits were divided into three time periods for multi-trait REML analysis by the individual animal model. For all traits, heritabilities increased or stayed the same for the later time periods. Heritability for conception status was 0.05. The first parity genetic correlation between conception status and protein yield was -0.38. Heritabilities decreased with the increase in parity for protein but remained the same for conception status. Realized genetic trends were greater than expected for cows born from 2008 through 2016 for somatic cell score, conception status and herd-life, and lower than expected for the production traits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of the study is to describe the registered cases and mortality from echinococcosis in Brazil, from 1995 to 2016. The records of two national databases, the Hospital Information System (HIS) and the Mortality Information System (MIS), were accessed during the period of 1995-2016. Demographic, epidemiological, and health care data related to the occurrence of disease and deaths attributed to echinococcosis in Brazil are described. The results showed that 7955 records of hospitalizations were documented in the HIS, during the study period, with 185 deaths from echinococcosis, and 113 records of deaths were documented in the MIS Deaths in every state of Brazil in the period. When comparing between states, the HIS showed great variability in mortality rates, possibly indicating heterogeneity in diagnosis and in the quality of health care received by patients. Less severe cases that do not require specialized care are not recorded by the information systems, thus the true burden of the disease could be underrepresented in the country. A change in the coding of disease records in the HIS in the late 1990s, (the integration of echinococcosis cases with other pathologies), led to the loss of specificity of the records. The records showed a wide geographic distribution of deaths from echinococcosis, reinforcing the need to expand the notification of the disease in Brazil. Currently, notification of cases is compulsory in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The major drivers of this collapse include both individual and synergic pathogen actions, threatening the colonies' survival. The need to define the epidemiological pattern of the pathogens that are involved has led to the establishment of monitoring programs in many countries, Italy included. In this framework, the health status of managed honey bees in the Emilia-Romagna region (northern Italy) was assessed, throughout the year 2021, on workers from 31 apiaries to investigate the presence of major known and emerging honey bee pathogens. The prevalence and abundance of DWV, KBV, ABPV, CBPV, Nosema ceranae, and trypanosomatids (Lotmaria passim, Crithidia mellificae, Crithidia bombi) were assessed by molecular methods. The most prevalent pathogen was DWV, followed by CBPV and N. ceranae. Trypanosomatids were not found in any of the samples. Pathogens had different peaks in abundance over the months, showing seasonal trends that were related to the dynamics of both bee colonies and Varroa destructor infestation. For some of the pathogens, a weak but significant correlation was observed between abundance and geographical longitude. The information obtained in this study increases our understanding of the epidemiological situation of bee colonies in Emilia-Romagna and helps us to implement better disease prevention and improved territorial management of honey bee health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although antibiotics are usually recommended for treating Salmonella infections, their misuse results in the evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. To minimize the health and economic burdens associated with antimicrobial resistance, a novel antibacterial strategy that can obliterate pathogens without any adverse effects on humans and animals is urgently required. Therefore, therapeutic supplementation of phages has gained renewed attention because of their unique ability to lyse specific hosts, cost-effective production, environmentally-friendly properties, and other potential advantages over antibiotics. In addition, the safety and efficacy of phage therapy for controlling poultry-associated Salmonella have already been proven through experimental studies. Phages can be applied at every stage of poultry production, processing, and distribution through different modes of application. Despite having a few limitations, the optimized and regulated use of phage cocktails may prove to be an effective option to combat infections caused by MDR pathogens in the post-antibiotic era. This article mainly focuses on the occurrence of salmonellosis in poultry and its reduction with the aid of bacteriophages. We particularly discuss the prevalence of Salmonella infections in poultry and poultry products; review the trends in antibiotic resistance; and summarize the application, challenges, and prospects of phage therapy in the poultry industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In vitro maturation (IVM) is the first and most critical step of IVEP, during which, the oocyte is matured in an artificial maturation medium under strict laboratory conditions. Despite all of the progress in the field of IVEP, the quality of in vitro matured oocytes remains inferior to that of those matured in vivo. The accumulation of substantial amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within oocytes during IVM has been regarded as one of the main factors altering oocyte quality. One of the most promising approaches to overcome ROS accumulation within oocytes is the supplementation of oocyte IVM medium with antioxidants.

Only a single phylogenetic study has been carried out in Cameroon, and neither an extensive genotyping aimed at identifying the different serotypes nor has an appropriate differential diagnosis of different species of Erysipelothrix has been effected in ASF-infected animals. Of the 377 blood or tissue samples randomly collected from pig farms and slaughter slabs from January to August 2020, 120 were positive for ASFV (by PCR), giving a prevalence of 31.83%. Intragenomic resolution through sequencing divulged the presence of genotypes I, and Ia, two variants with 19 (ABNAAAACBNABTDBNAFA) and six (ABNAFA) tandem repeat sequences (TRS), serotype IV, and a single GGAATATATA repeat. The sole presence of E. tonsillarum (avirulent species) and not E. rhusiopathiae (virulent species) indicates that the severity observed during the 2020 ASF outbreak in the sampled regions was exclusively due to ASFV genotype I infection. Such characterisations are necessary for designing effective control measures and future potential vaccine candidates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006356</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Myers-Briggs Personality Types of Veterinary Students and Their Animal Ethical Profiles in Comparison to Criminal Justice Students in Slovenia.</Title>	<Abstract>Personality types are related to trustworthy, reliable, and competent communication, especially when dealing with clients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the Myers-Briggs (MBTI) indicator could be used to detect differences in the personality preferences of students at the Veterinary Faculty, University of Ljubljana (VS) compared to students at the Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security, University of Maribor (CJS). Our aim was to profile the two cohorts of students in Slovenia, to compare profiles of students from the social and natural sciences with similar personality traits, and to compare them with published results. CJS are considered well-established, well-studied, non-science ombudsman profiles of students in Slovenia for whom care and safety will play important roles in their future work, similar to VS. Views of people's duties to animals and the implications for animal care, safety, and welfare are also very important, especially for VS. For this reason, we tested the ethical viewpoints of the two cohorts of students using an interactive web-based program. Our results show that both VS and CJS had different MBTI types, with ISTJ (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging) preferences predominating, followed by INFJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging) in VS and ESTJ (Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging) in CJS. Between the two cohorts, the ratio between ISFJ and INFJ was statistically different. In the animal ethics study, the utilitarian viewpoint was most prevalent and statistically higher in VS compared to CJS, where the animal rights perspective was most prevalent. Compared to previous profile studies, some differences were found that could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the different generations of students. Overall, this study highlights the importance of personality traits for better communication, work, and animal research in veterinary science as well as criminal justice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We confirmed the conventional clinico-histopathological features of MCF, as well was the presence of Ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV-2) DNA in several tissues, employing histological and virological investigations. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that this Sardinian OvHV-2 strain is genetically similar to all the other Italian strains. By Real Time PCR examinations of blood samples collected across Sardinia's sheep population, which is considered the most important reservoir species, we discovered an OvHV-2 prevalence ranging from 20 to 30 percent. Despite the high prevalence of OvHV-2 in the Sardinian sheep population, clinical disease in bovine remains sporadic; further investigations are needed to understand the risk factors that regulate this epidemiological aspect.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In laboratory-kept animals, hemoplasmas have been described as an important confounding variable. Different hemoplasma species have been detected infecting non-human primates (NHP) from Brazil. However, the occurrence of hemoplasma species in laboratory-kept NHP in Brazil has not-yet been assessed. Accordingly, this study aimed (i) to screen laboratory-kept rhesus monkeys for hemoplasmas, (ii) to verify if any of the hemoplasma-positive animals demonstrate hematological abnormalities, and (iii) to assess the genotype diversity of hemoplasma species in NHP from Brazil. Five out of eight (62.5%; 95% CI: 3.05-8.63) rhesus monkeys tested positive for hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. by PCR. Sequencing, phylogenetic, distance, and genotype diversity analyses of partial 16S rRNA gene demonstrate that rhesus monkeys were infected by 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haematomacacae' (formerly 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomacaque'). Assessments of partial 16S rRNA diversity of hemoplasma species in NHP suggest that at least four genetically diverse groups may occur in Brazil. Although no hematological abnormalities were demonstrated in rhesus monkeys evaluated herein, future studies are needed to elucidate the influence of 'Ca. M. haematomacacae' as a confounding variable on research studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

If left untreated, pythiosis may be fatal. This organism is not a true fungus because its cell wall and cell membrane lack chitin and ergosterol, respectively, requiring specific treatment. Identifying the organism is challenging, as a hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain poorly stain the P. insidiosum hyphae and cannot be differentiated conclusively from other fungal or fungal-like organisms (such as Lagenidium sp.) morphologically. Our study aimed to develop a nested PCR to detect P. insidiosum and compare it with the traditional histopathologic detection of hyphae. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue scrolls from 26 dogs with lesions suggesting the P. insidiosum infection were assessed histologically, and DNA was extracted from the FFPE tissue sections for nested PCR. Agreement between the histologic stains, (H&amp;E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and/or Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) and the nested PCR occurred in 18/26 cases. Hyphae consistent with Pythium sp. were identified via histopathology in 57.7% of the samples, whereas the nested PCR detected P. insidiosum in 76.9% of samples, aiding in the sensitivity of the diagnosis of pythiosis in dogs. Using this combination of techniques, we report 20 canine cases of pythiosis over 18 years in Indiana and Kentucky, an unexpectedly high incidence for temperate climatic regions. Using a combination of histopathology evaluation and nested PCR is recommended to aid in the accurate diagnosis of pythiosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty (n = 50) 20 cm long jejunal loops were randomly assigned to be transected with RFVS devices and linear stapler (Caiman5, Caiman Maryland, Caiman12, Ligasure Atlas, and Stapler group as control respectively). Caiman5, Caiman12 and stapler required only one activation to complete the sealing. The mean BP in Caiman5 and Caiman Maryland groups were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than the S group as control and the other RFVS devices studied. RFVS Caiman12 and Ligasure Atlas produced mean BP values that were close to the Control and did not differ between them. The lumen was totally closed in the Caiman12 and Ligasure Atlas groups. The findings of this investigation were promising; we discovered that Caiman12 and Ligasure Atlas produce comparable mechanical capabilities as well as stapled intestinal closure, however Caiman12 need a single activation to complete the transection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Radiography and ultrasonography revealed an oval, dorsal, pharyngeal mass, with an internal horizontal line demarcating the radiolucent area from the radio-opaque area. Upper airway endoscopy revealed pus-like deposits in the dorsal nasal passage, hyperemia, and edema in the dorsal pharynx, leading to swelling and airway obstruction. Manual palpation, after sedation, revealed a thickened mass surface, which was difficult to rupture with manual pressure. After inserting a linear sonographic probe through the mouth to establish the vascularity surrounding the mass and to identify a relatively thin-walled area, a trocar was pierced into the mass under endoscopic guidance, and the opening was enlarged manually. The mass was filled with stale pus-like material, which was removed manually. The abscess cavity was washed using saline and povidone-iodine. Day 1 post-surgery, dysphagia and wheezing disappeared. Day 16 post-surgery, endoscopy showed significant improvement in the airway patency. One year postoperatively, the owner reported that the cow had an uneventful recovery. For deep abscesses, such as bovine pharyngeal abscesses, it is important to perform a preoperative transoral Doppler ultrasonography to assess the vascularity and thickness of the abscess wall for safe trocar insertion and abscess drainage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since the existing information on cat spermatogenesis is limited and somewhat contradictory, in the present study, germ cell proliferation and apoptosis in feral adult tomcats orchiectomized during reproductive (reproductive group, RG; February-July) and non-reproductive (non-reproductive group, NRG; November and December) seasons were compared. Cross-sections taken from the middle third of the left testis were chemically fixed and embedded in paraffin wax. Histological sections were processed for the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating germ cells (PCNA) and for the identification of apoptotic cells (TUNEL method). The percentage of PCNA-positive spermatogonia was higher in the RG than in the NRG. On the contrary, germ cell apoptosis was higher in the NRG than in the RG. Our results confirm that cat spermatogenesis is modulated on a seasonal basis and suggests that spermatogenesis control involves changes in germ cell proliferation and apoptosis according to a common paradigm of seasonally breeding species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The vitreous samples obtained during vitrectomies were usually tested for anti-Leptospira antibodies and for more than 20 years also by PCR for leptospiral DNA. If the indication for surgery was ophthalmologically inconclusive, an aqueous humor was collected preoperatively and examined for evidence of leptospiral infection. In this study, medical records from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed. Records for 1387 eyes affected by equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) and 237 eyes affected by another type of uveitis met the inclusion criteria. A total of 216 samples from healthy eyes were used as controls. In 83% of intraocular samples from ERU eyes, antibody titers of 1:100 or higher were detectable by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Similarly, 83% of intraocular samples had anti-Leptospira antibodies detected by ELISA. In 72% of the intraocular specimens, leptospiral DNA was detectable by PCR. No antibodies were detectable in the samples from eyes with another type of uveitis or in the samples from healthy eyes. A PCR was positive in only one sample from a healthy eye. These results with a very high number of intraocular specimens demonstrate the great importance of an intraocular leptospiral infection for ERU. It can be concluded that for a reliable diagnosis of intraocular leptospiral infection or to reliably exclude an infection multiple tests should be applied.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36006364</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Possible Consequences of Climate Change on Survival, Productivity and Reproductive Performance, and Welfare of Himalayan Yak (Bos grunniens).</Title>	<Abstract>Yak are adapted to the extreme cold, low oxygen, and high solar radiation of the Himalaya. Traditionally, they are kept at high altitude pastures during summer, moving lower in the winter. This system is highly susceptible to climate change, which has increased ambient temperatures, altered rainfall patterns and increased the occurrence of natural disasters. Changes in temperature and precipitation reduced the yield and productivity of alpine pastures, principally because the native plant species are being replaced by less useful shrubs and weeds. The impact of climate change on yak is likely to be mediated through heat stress, increased contact with other species, especially domestic cattle, and alterations in feed availability. Yak have a very low temperature humidity index (52 vs. 72 for cattle) and a narrow thermoneutral range (5-13 &#176;C), so climate change has potentially exposed yak to heat stress in summer and winter. Heat stress is likely to affect both reproductive performance and milk production, but we lack the data to quantify such effects. Increased contact with other species, especially domestic cattle, is likely to increase disease risk. This is likely to be exacerbated by other climate-change-associated factors, such as increases in vector-borne disease, because of increases in vector ranges, and overcrowding associated with reduced pasture availability. However, lack of baseline yak disease data means it is difficult to quantify these changes in disease risk and the few papers claiming to have identified such increases do not provide robust evidence of increased diseases. The reduction in feed availability in traditional pastures may be thought to be the most obvious impact of climate change on yak; however, it is clear that such a reduction is not solely due to climate change, with socio-economic factors likely being more important. This review has highlighted the large potential negative impact of climate change on yak, and the lack of data quantifying that impact. More research on the impact of climate change in yak is needed. Attention also needs to be paid to developing mitigating strategies, which may include changes in the traditional system such as providing shelter and supplementary feed and, in marginal areas, increased use of yak-cattle hybrids.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PRRSV-1 was first isolated in China in 2006. However, there were few reports concerning the genetic characteristics of PRRSV-1 in China. In this study, three PRRSV-1 strains (HL85, HeB3, and HeB47) were detected by a general RT-qPCR method from clinical samples in 2018. HeB47 was identified as a recombinant between the BJEU06-1 and CReSA228-like strains. To further analyze the recombination and deletion features of PRRSV-1, all the available 88 complete genome sequences (isolated in 19 countries) from 1991 to 2018 in GenBank were analyzed. The high-frequency recombination regions were concentrated in NSP2 and GP2 to GP4. More importantly, phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV-1 revealed four independent introductions in China. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the important monitoring of breeding pigs and pork products and epidemiological surveys on pig farms to prevent the further spread of PRRSV-1.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36136667</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Study on NGF and VEGF during the Equine Perinatal Period-Part 1: Healthy Foals Born from Normal Pregnancy and Parturition.</Title>	<Abstract>The importance of trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during the perinatal period, is now emerging. Through their functional activities of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, they play a key role in the final maturation of the nervous and vascular systems. The present study aims to: (i) evaluate the NGF and VEGF levels obtained at parturition from the mare, foal and umbilical cord vein plasma, as well as in amniotic fluid; (ii) evaluate NGF and VEGF content in the plasma of healthy foals during the first 72 h of life (T0, T24 and T72); (iii) evaluate NGF and VEGF levels at parturition in relation to the selected mares&#8217; and foals&#8217; clinical parameters; (iv) evaluate the relationship between the two trophic factors and the thyroid hormone levels (TT3 and TT4) in the first 72 h of life; (v) assess mRNA expression of NGF, VEGF and BDNF and their cell surface receptors in the placenta. Fourteen Standardbred healthy foals born from mares with normal pregnancies and parturitions were included in the study. The dosage of NGF and VEGF levels was performed using commercial ELISA kits, whereas NGF, VEGF and BDNF placental gene expression was performed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. In foal plasma, both NGF and VEGF levels decreased significantly over time, from T0 to T24 (p = 0.0066 for NGF; p &lt; 0.0001 for VEGF) and from T0 to T72 (p = 0.0179 for NGF; p = 0.0016 for VEGF). In foal serum, TT3 levels increased significantly over time from T0 to T24 (p = 0.0058) and from T0 to T72 (p = 0.0013), whereas TT4 levels decreased significantly over time from T0 to T24 (p = 0.0201) and from T0 to T72 (p &lt; 0.0001). A positive correlation was found in the levels of NGF and VEGF in foal plasma at each time point (p = 0.0115; r = 0.2862). A positive correlation was found between NGF levels in the foal plasma at T0 and lactate (p = 0.0359; r = 0.5634) as well as between VEGF levels in the foal plasma at T0 and creatine kinase (p = 0.0459; r = 0.5407). VEGF was expressed in all fetal membranes, whereas NGF and its receptors were not expressed in the amnion. The close relationship between the two trophic factors in foal plasma over time and their fine expression in placental tissues appear to be key regulators of fetal development and adaptation to extra-uterine life.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36136668</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Metagenomic Characterization and Volatile Compounds Determination in Rumen from Saanen Goat Kids Fed Olive Leaves.</Title>	<Abstract>The accumulation and disposal of by-products deriving from the agro-food industry represents a problem both from an economic and environmental point of view. The use of these matrices in zootechnical nutrition could represent a feasible solution. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a diet containing olive leaves (OL), a by-product of the olive industry, on the ruminal microbial community of Saanen goat kids and on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during the digestion. Twenty goat kids were randomly divided into two groups of ten goat kids each. The control group (CTR) was fed with a standard diet, while the experimental group (OL+) received a custom-formulated diet containing 10 % OL on a dry matter (DM) basis. After 30 days of trial, genomic DNA was extracted from the rumen liquor and prepared for 16S rRNA-gene sequencing to characterize the rumen microbiota; furthermore, rumen VOCs were also characterized by solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Shannon&#8217;s alpha index was not significantly different between the two groups, on the contrary, Bray-Curtis (p &lt; 0.01) and Jaccard (p &lt; 0.01) distances evidenced that feed affected microbial community. Eleven genera were influenced by OL supplementation, with a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in Paludibacter, Fibrobacter, Sphaerochaeta Christensenella, Rikenella, Oligosphaera, Candidatus Endomicrobium, Anaerovorax, and Atopobium was observed, while the percentages of Bacteroides and Selenomonas were reduced (p &lt; 0.05). Differences were also observed between the two groups at the family level (p &lt; 0.004). Fibrobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Oligosphaeraceae, Candidatus Endomicrobium, and Planctomycetaceae were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in goat kids fed OL diet compared to CTR, while the levels of other identified families, Succinivibrionaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, were opposite (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, results showed that the main phyla in both groups were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes; however, no significant differences in the relative abundance of any phyla were observed between the two groups. In addition to what has been reported, the analysis of VOCs at the rumen level showed the ability of the OL integration to induce an increase in hexanoic acid and a parallel decrease in decanal. Furthermore, only in OL+ samples there was the accumulation of &#945;-terpineol to which a wide range of interesting biological properties is attributed. The presence of VOCs associated with health status suggests a favorable role of OL in preserving and improving animal welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cats diagnosed with CE were evaluated to investigate the relationships between TP, SPE and endoscopy, histopathology, and extraintestinal involvement. Medical records were searched for cats with a history of chronic gastrointestinal signs and a final diagnosis of CE. Information on signalment, TP, SPE, endoscopic score, histopathological diagnosis and score, and concurrent hepatic or pancreatic ultrasonographic alterations was collected. Relationships between protein profiles and other variables were investigated. Ninety-nine cats were included in the study, 63 diagnosed with various degrees of bowel inflammation and 36 with small-cell alimentary lymphoma. The most common TP alteration was hypoproteinemia (24%). No significant differences were observed between protein profiles and endoscopic and histopathological severity scores. Forty-five cats showing concurrent pancreatic and/or hepatic ultrasonographic alterations, had significantly lower albumin, lower &#945;-globulin, and higher &#947;-globulin levels than cats not showing concurrent alterations. Disease severity scores did not seem to influence the protein profile in cats with CE. Extraintestinal involvement may be suspected in cats with lower albumin and &#945;-globulins and higher &#947;-globulins.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on the findings of the general clinical examination of 650 milking cows, 10 cows with subclinical mastitis (SCM) and 10 clinically healthy cows (HG) were selected (without clinical signs of any diseases). Rumination behavior biomarkers were registered with RumiWatch noseband sensors (RWS; ITIN + HOCH GmbH, F&#252;tterungstechnik, Liestal, Switzerland). Sensors were implanted on the first day after calving. Data from the RWS 13 days before diagnosis of SCM and 13 days after diagnosis of SCM were compared with HG data from the same period. Healthy cows were checked alongside SCM cows on the same days. In our study, we found that healthy cows spent more time engaging in rumination and drinking (p &lt; 0.05) and also had more boluses per rumination. Moreover, among cows with subclinical mastitis, rumination time from day 4 to day 0 decreased by 60.91%, drinking time decreased by 48.47%, and the number of boluses per rumination decreased by 8.67% (p &lt; 0.05). The results indicate that subclinical affects time and rumination chews registered with sensor systems. However, additional studies with larger numbers of animals are required to confirm these results. Furthermore, the impact of heat stress, estrus, and other effects on rumination behavior biomarkers should be evaluated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A reduced Fischer ratio (BCAAs/AAAs) has been found to be associated with hepatic fibrosis and is useful for assessing prognosis in human patients. In veterinary medicine, few studies have been performed, and in contrast to human patients, dogs with different kinds of hepatopathy tend to show both increased AAAs and BCAAs. In dogs, the association between histological scores and serum AAs has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum AAs in dogs with chronic hepatitis (CH) compared with a healthy control group (C) and, among CH dogs, in relation to their histological fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity scores. Leftover serum samples of 16 dogs with histological CH and 25 healthy dogs were employed. Serum AAs were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Proline and the AAAs phenylalaine and tyrosine progressively increased with the histological severity. In contrast, cysteine, tryptophan and BCAA isoleucine progressively reduced. Lysine and the BCAAs leucine and valine showed a non-linear trend with the histological findings. The BCAAs/AAAs ratio was significatively reduced if higher grades of liver fibrosis were present.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The first aim of this study is to describe a network of inertial measurement units system (IMUs) for quantifying FJA simultaneously in all limbs. The second aim is to evaluate the accuracy of IMUs for quantifying the sagittal plane FJA overground in comparison to bi-dimensional (2-D) optical motion capture (OMC). 14 horses (7 free from lameness and 7 lame) were enrolled and analyzed with both systems at walk and trot on a firm surface. All enrolled horses were instrumented with 8 IMUs (a pair for each limb) positioned at the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal/metatarsal bone and pastern and acquiring data at 200 Hz. Passive markers were glued on the center of rotation of carpus/tarsus, fetlock, and distal interphalangeal joint, and video footages were captured at 60 Hz and digitalized for OMC acquisition. The IMU system accuracy was reported as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The Granger Causality Test (GCT) and the Bland&#8722;Altman analysis were computed between the IMUs and OMC patterns to determine the agreement between the two systems. The proposed IMU system was able to provide FJAs in all limbs using a patented method for sensor calibration and related algorithms. Fetlock joint range of motion (FJROM) variability of three consecutive strides was analyzed in the population through 3-way ANOVA. FJA patterns quantified by IMUs demonstrated high accuracy at the walk (RMSE 8.23&#176; &#177; 3.74&#176;; PCC 0.95 &#177; 0.03) and trot (RMSE 9.44&#176; &#177; 3.96&#176;; PCC 0.96 &#177; 0.02) on both sound (RMSE 7.91&#176; &#177; 3.19&#176;; PCC 0.97 &#177; 0.03) and lame horses (RMSE 9.78&#176; &#177; 4.33&#176;; PCC 0.95 &#177; 0.03). The two systems&#8217; measurements agreed (mean bias around 0) and produced patterns that were in temporal agreement in 97.33% of the cases (p &lt; 0.01). The main source of variability between left and right FJROM in the population was the presence of lameness (p &lt; 0.0001) and accounted for 28.46% of this total variation. IMUs system accurately quantified sagittal plane FJA at walk and trot in both sound and lame horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, whilst there are numerous reports of extracranial (spinal, orbital and sinonasal) meningiomas in the dog, there have only been a few case reports of spinal meningiomas, and no post-mortem confirmed orbital or sinonasal meningiomas in cats. In this report, a 20-year-old captive tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) with a history of chronic ocular inflammation resulting in enucleation, spontaneously developed tetanic convulsions (epileptic seizures) that over a 2-year period resulted in a gradually worsening condition and the animal was eventually euthanized. At autopsy, a focal, expansile, neoplastic mass was found in the caudal nasal cavity midline, abutting the cribriform plate and slightly compressing the calvarium. Histological analysis revealed nasal turbinates attached to a well-circumscribed expansile multi-lobular mass consisting of interlacing whorls and streams of neoplastic cells supported by a variably fibrous to microcystic collagenous matrix displaying rare psammoma bodies. The diagnosis was sinonasal transitional meningioma. This is the first report of a captive wild felid with an extracranial meningioma, specifically a tiger with a sinonasal transitional meningioma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the protective efficacy of the trivalent inactivated IC vaccine (PT Medion Farma Jaya) against the field isolates of three serovars of Av. paragallinarum was verified. After vaccination, the hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers in double-vaccinated groups (A2, B2, and C2) were higher than those in single-vaccinated groups (A1, B1, and C1). The highest antibody titer was 213.1 at 3 weeks after the booster vaccination in group A2. Consistent with the trend in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers, the protective efficacy of double vaccination was better than that of single vaccination. The clinical symptoms and pathological changes were alleviated, or the bacterial shedding was significantly reduced with double vaccination after challenge with field isolates of three serovars (p &lt; 0.05). In particular, the chickens with double vaccination showed no clinical symptoms, pathological changes, or bacterial shedding after challenge by the serovar C strain. There was no significant difference in body weight and egg production between the double-vaccinated groups and the negative control group (p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, we recommend that the commercial IC vaccine should be double-vaccinated in clinical applications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Understanding the underlying pathophysiology is important in formulating a rational approach to diagnosis. The preliminary aim was to clinically characterize a population of foals spontaneously affected by NE. The study aimed to: (i) evaluate nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in plasma samples obtained in the affected population at parturition from the mare&#8217;s jugular vein, umbilical cord vein and foal&#8217;s jugular vein, as well as in amniotic fluid; (ii) evaluate the NGF and VEGF content in the plasma of foals affected by NE during the first 72 h of life/hospitalization; (iii) evaluate NGF and VEGF levels at birth/admission in relation to selected mare&#8217;s and foal&#8217;s clinical parameters; (iv) evaluate the relationship between the two trophic factors and thyroid hormone levels (TT3 and TT4) in the first 72 h of life/hospitalization; and (v) assess the mRNA expression of NGF, VEGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and their cell surface receptors, in the placenta of mares that delivered foals affected by NE. Thirteen affected foals born from mares hospitalized for peripartum monitoring (group NE) and twenty affected foals hospitalized after birth (group exNE) were included in the study. Dosage of NGF and VEGF levels was performed using commercial ELISA kits, whereas NGF, VEGF, and BDNF placental gene expression was performed using a semi-quantitative real-time PCR. In group NE, NGF levels decreased significantly from T0 to T24 (p = 0.0447) and VEGF levels decreased significantly from T0 to T72 (p = 0.0234), whereas in group exNE, only NGF levels decreased significantly from T0 to T24 (p = 0.0304). Compared to healthy foals, a significant reduction of TT3 levels was observed in both NE (T24, p = 0.0066; T72 p = 0.0003) and exNE (T0, p = 0.0082; T24, p &lt; 0.0001; T72, p &lt; 0.0001) groups, whereas a significant reduction of TT4 levels was observed only in exNE group (T0, p = 0.0003; T24, p = 0.0010; T72, p = 0.0110). In group NE, NGF levels were positively correlated with both TT3 (p = 0.0475; r = 0.3424) and TT4 levels (p = 0.0063; r = 0.4589). In the placenta, a reduced expression of NGF in the allantois (p = 0.0033) and a reduced expression of BDNF in the amnion (p = 0.0498) were observed. The less pronounced decrease of the two trophic factors compared to healthy foals, their relationship with thyroid hormones over time, and the reduced expression of NGF and BDNF in placental tissues of mares that delivered affected foals, could be key regulators in the mechanisms of equine NE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The goose industry suffers significant economic losses as a result of GP, which is found to be widespread worldwide, with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Our group developed a novel technique for detecting GPV nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) and the characterization of its specificity and sensitivity. It was developed by using the traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nanoparticles. The findings of this study revealed that GPV nanoPCR products were 389 bp in length, and the lower limit of the nanoPCR assay was 4.68 &#215; 10[2] copies/&#956;L, whereas that of the conventional PCR assay was 4.68 &#215; 10[4] copies/&#956;L. A total of 230 geese suspected of GPV were detected using nanoPCR, with a positive rate of 83.0% and a specificity of 73%, respectively. Overall, we present a hitherto undocumented method for identifying GPV by using nanoPCR to aid in the evaluation of subclinical illness.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess the ability of the MENT-EGAS prototype-based EN to respond to direct sampling and to evaluate the influence of possible error sources that might affect the quality of VOC signatures. This study was performed on a dairy farm using 11 (n = 11) multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows. The cows were divided into two groups housed in two different barns: group I included six lactating cows fed with a lactating diet (LD), and group II included 5 non-lactating late pregnant cows fed with a far-off diet (FD). Each group was offered 250 g of their respective diet; 10 min later, exhalated breath was collected for VOC determination. After this sampling, 4 cows from each group were offered 250 g of pellet concentrates. Ten minutes later, the exhalated breath was collected once more. VOCs were also measured directly from the feed's headspace, as well as from the environmental backgrounds of each. Principal component analyses (PCA) were performed and revealed clear discrimination between the two different environmental backgrounds, the two different feed headspaces, the exhalated breath of groups I and II cows, and the exhalated breath within the same group of cows before and after the feed intake. Based on these findings, we concluded that the MENT-EGAS prototype can recognize several error sources with accuracy, providing a novel EN technology that could be used in the future in precision livestock farming.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease causes fever and hemorrhagic manifestations in humans but not in animals. Domestic and wild animals are asymptomatic hosts of CCHFV and are critical in the transmission cycle. Hyalomma marginatum spp. has been identified as the natural reservoir and vector of the virus in Turkiye. A few studies have been conducted on domesticated animals showing the seroprevalence of CCHFV in them, but seroevidence in wild animals is absent. For contributing this antrum to the understanding of virus transmission in Turkiye, we performed a seroprevalence investigation of CCHFV in both wild and domesticated animals in various geographical areas of Turkiye. In-house IgG iELISA was performed for the screening of sera IgG in a total of 582 animal samples collected from boar (n = 40), cattle (n = 259), goat (n = 132), hare (n = 21), and sheep (n = 130). Results from ELISA performed on domestic animals revealed 10.81%, 15.15%, and 19.23% anti-CCHF virus seropositivity in cattle, goats, and sheep, respectively, in collected serum samples. ELISA tests performed in wild animals showed 23.81% and 2.5% positivity in hare and wild boars, respectively, suggesting the importance of wild animals in CCHF virus epidemiology in Turkiye. This study performed the first serological investigation of CCHFV in wild animals and provided the first seroevidence of CCHFV in wild boars and hare in Turkiye.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The characterization of the fecal microbiota in health and disease can be critical to unravel the bacterial dynamics associated with diarrhea and help with its prevention and control. In this study, we aimed to detect changes in the fecal microbiota of calves that experienced early-life diarrhea episodes. Fecal samples were taken from calves remaining healthy and calves with an episode of diarrhea during the study. We sampled at arrival (12 days of age) and after one and two months of life; also, at the time of the diarrhea episode for the diarrheic calves (day 17). Samples were processed to extract total DNA, submitted to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and bioinformatically analyzed to infer the bacterial populations. Microbiota changes through time were reported for both groups. However, we detected an earlier stabilization in the healthy group. Moreover, we detected changes within low abundant taxa that may play a role in the subsequent health status of the animals. The fecal microbiota of healthy and diarrheic calves showed different dynamics in the diversity through time that may be the reflections of the variations within low-abundant taxa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on various differences, the serovar Grippotyphosa has been divided into two types, Moskva V and Duyster. Differences or similarities of the two type strains in the context of leptospiral diagnostics have not yet been elucidated in more detail; therefore both strains were analysed in MAT diagnostics for the detection of leptospiral infections in pigs, dogs and horses. Serum samples from 2996 pigs, 55 dogs and 35 horses, as well as vitreous and/or aqueous fluid samples from these and 13 additional horses were analysed by MAT; available supplementary samples were tested for leptospires by PCR. In pigs, 92.6% of the samples with both strains received an identical titre result in the MAT test, whereas in dogs and horses only 53.0% and 43.6% had concordant results. Since infections with the serovar Grippotyphosa occur more frequently in dogs and horses overall, more differences were observed here. In the case of discrepant serological results, supplementary samples and PCR examinations were not able to add information on the true status. Further analyses of follow-up studies or at least serum pairs from dogs and horses infected with the serovar Grippotyphosa are necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To date, Eimeria tenella ROPs are not well studied. This study identified and characterized a novel E. tenella ROP (EtROP35), which showed the highest levels among 28 putative ROPs in previous sporozoite and merozoite transcriptomes. Sequence analysis showed that EtROP35 contains an N-terminal secretory signal and a protein kinase domain including eight conserved ROP35-subfamily motifs. Subsequent experiments confirmed that it is a secretory protein. Subcellular localization revealed it localized at the apical end of the sporozoites and merozoites, which was consistent with the ROPs of other Apicomplexan parasites. To further understand the biological meaning of EtROP35, expression levels in different developmental stages and sporozoite invasion-blocking assay were investigated. EtROP35 showed significantly higher levels in sporozoites (6.23-fold) and merozoites (7.00-fold) than sporulated oocysts. Sporozoite invasion-blocking assay revealed that anti-EtROP35 polyclonal antibody significantly reduced the sporozoite invasion rate, suggesting it might participate in host cell invasion and be a viable choice as a vaccine candidate. The immunological protective assays showed that EtROP35 could induce a high level of serum IgY and higher mean body weight gain, and lower cecum lesion score and oocysts excretion than the challenged control group. These data indicated that EtROP35 had good immunogenicity and may be a promising vaccine candidate against E. tenella.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Investigations have demonstrated that some infectious organisms can have a direct role in the development of neoplasia, whereas others can predispose to neoplasia by alterations in the immune response, or by creating a pro-inflammatory environment. Feline leukaemia virus was one of the first infectious agents recognised as an oncogenic organism, and along with feline immunodeficiency virus has received the most attention. Since the discovery of this retrovirus, several other organisms have been associated with neoplastic processes in cats, these include gammaherpes virus, mouse mammary tumour virus, papillomaviruses, hepadnavirus, Helicobacter species, and the parasitic infections Platynosomum fastosum and Opisthorchis viverrini.

No information on these parameters in healthy cats less than 1 year of age exists. We aimed to evaluate serum concentrations of fPLI, fTLI, and cobalamin in healthy cats at different time-points during their first 12 months of life. Fourteen healthy 2-month-old kittens were included. Blood was collected at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, and serum concentrations of fPLI, fTLI, and cobalamin were measured. While there was a statistically significant difference in serum fPLI concentrations over time, there was no statistically significant difference between individual time-points. There was no significant difference in serum fTLI concentrations over time. Serum cobalamin concentrations were below the reference interval in 3/13 cats at 2 months of age and were significantly lower by 3 months, when 13/14 had hypocobalaminemia. By 12 months, serum cobalamin had significantly increased, yet 4/12 cats still had hypocobalaminemia. Serum fPLI and fTLI concentrations did not show any statistically or clinically significant differences in young kittens. In contrast, serum cobalamin concentrations were commonly below the reference interval in kittens. Serum fPLI and fTLI concentrations are not practically affected by age in kittens as young as 2 months of age and could be used for the investigation of pancreatic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During captivity, both cats were kept as isolated as possible from humans and fed appropriate live wild prey. After maturing and demonstrating the ability to capture and feed on live prey, the cats were radio-collared, released at a national wildlife refuge previously assessed for predator and prey occurrence, and monitored. After 54 days, the ocelot was trapped while preying on chickens in a nearby community, and after 20 days, the margay was found dead, likely due to ocelot predation. Avoiding habituation to humans, assuring hunting abilities, and assessing release sites likely is not sufficient to assure successful release of these species, and more experimental releases with innovative and detailed protocols and monitoring are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36136686</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Activating Fc Gamma Receptors and Viral Receptors Are Required for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Infection.</Title>	<Abstract>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an event in preexisting sub-, or non-neutralizing antibodies increasing the viral replication in its target cells. ADE is one crucial factor that intensifies porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection and results in PRRSV-persistent infection. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of PRRSV-ADE infection are poorly understood. In the current research, the results of the ADE assay showed that porcine immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific for the PRRSV significantly enhanced PRRSV proliferation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), suggesting that the ADE activity of PRRSV infection existed in pig anti-PRRSV IgG. The results of the RNA interference assay showed that knockdown of the Fc gamma receptor I (Fc&#947;RI) or Fc&#947;RIII gene significantly suppressed the ADE activity of PRRSV infection in PAMs, suggesting that Fc&#947;RI and Fc&#947;RIII were responsible for mediating PRRSV-ADE infection. In addition, the results of the antibody blocking assay showed that specific blocking of the Sn1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 extracellular domain of the sialoadhesin (Sn) protein or selective blockade of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) 5 domain of the CD163 molecule significantly repressed the ADE activity of PRRSV infection in PAMs, suggesting that Sn and CD163 were involved in Fc&#947;R-mediated PRRSV-ADE infection. The Sn1-6 domains of porcine Sn protein and the SRCR 5 domain of porcine CD163 molecule might play central roles in the ADE of PRRSV infection. In summary, our studies indicated that activating Fc&#947;Rs (Fc&#947;RI and Fc&#947;RIII) and viral receptors (Sn and CD163) were required for ADE of PRRSV infection. Our findings provided a new insight into PRRSV infection that could be enhanced by Fc&#947;Rs and PRRSV receptors-mediated PRRSV-antibody immune complexes (ICs), which would deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of PRRSV-persistent infection via the ADE pathway.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In our research, we investigated the biological characteristics of the isolate by using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing, biochemical assay, and drug sensitivity test. Moreover, the pathogenicity study, including the bacteria load determination, the histopathology examination, and the RNA sequencing was carried out to explore whether the isolate could cause lung injury in mice through intraperitoneal injection. The results indicated that the isolate was identified as K. pneumoniae and named as KPHN001. The drug susceptibility test showed that KPHN001 was only sensitive to polymyxin B and furazolidone, and was resistant to other 28 antibiotics. In the bacteria load determination, the highest bacterial load of the organs was found in the spleen, and abundant bacterial colonization was also found in the lung. The histopathology showed the mainly acute inflammations in the lung were due to congestion, edema, and exudation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were expressed massively in mice. In the present research, the biological characteristics and pathogenesis of clinically isolated K. pneumoniae were systematically studied, revealing the pathogenic mechanism of K. pneumoniae to animals, and providing a theoretical basis for the following prevention, control, and diagnosis research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Commonly used treatment modalities are radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or both. Typical chemotherapy protocols used in cats with nasal lymphoma are COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine prednisolone) and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). Thus far, the use of single-agent chlorambucil in nasal lymphoma has been evaluated in a single case report. We report a case series of three cats with B cell nasal lymphoma, two cats with intermediate cell, and one large cell, all with a low mitotic index (MI) of less than 5 mitotic figures per &#215;400 field, treated with chlorambucil and prednisolone. Two of the cases achieved a long disease-free interval, while the one with the highest MI did not. Protocols using chlorambucil and prednisolone may have potential as a first-line therapy for feline nasal lymphoma cases with a very low mitotic index.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of splenic and hepatic involvement in newly diagnosed canine low-grade cMCT (Patnaik grade I-II, Kiupel low-grade). Medical records of dogs that underwent a clinical staging work-up and surgical excision for a low-grade cMCT between December 2019 and December 2021 were reviewed at five veterinary centers. Only dogs with a histological diagnosis of low-grade cMCT, FNA or histology of the eTDLN, FNA of the spleen and liver, and one year of follow up were included. One hundred and thirty-six dogs met the inclusion criteria. Only 1 out of 136 dogs (0.7%) had the presence of visceral metastases at diagnosis, suggesting that the prevalence of visceral metastases in low-grade cMCT is extremely low. The results of this study are consistent with previous literature and suggest that after a diagnosis of low-grade cMCT, cytology of visceral organs may not represent an essential step in the clinical staging work-up.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To verify whether BPV infection causes dysregulation of the pRb-Cyclin D1-p16[CDKN2A]-p53 pathway as reported for human papillomavirus (HPV), the study employed immunohistochemistry to test 55 equine sarcoid biopsies for the expression of pRb, Cyclin D1, and p53 cell cycle regulatory proteins and to evaluate the proliferative rate through Ki67. High Cyclin D1 and pRb expression were observed in 51% and 80% of cases, respectively, while low expression was observed in 49% and 20% of cases, respectively. Significantly higher Ki67 proliferation indexes were observed in fibroblastic, nodular, and mixed sarcoids compared to the occult and verrucous. High proliferation was significantly associated with high Cyclin D1 expression. In contrast with previous studies, p53 positivity was not observed in the cases examined in this study. Moreover, follow-up analysis revealed that fibroblastic, mixed sarcoids were associated with significantly higher local recurrence rates while the verrucous subtype was associated with higher rates of new sarcoid development at distant sites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with essential oils (EOs) on productive performance, rumen parameters, serum metabolites, and quality of products (meat and milk) derived from small ruminants by means of a meta-analysis. Seventy-four peer-reviewed publications were included in the data set. Weighted mean differences (WMD) between the EOs treatments and the control treatment were used to assess the magnitude of effect. Dietary inclusion of EOs increased (p &lt; 0.05) dry matter intake (WMD = 0.021 kg/d), dry matter digestibility (WMD = 14.11 g/kg of DM), daily weight gain (WMD = 0.008 kg/d), and feed conversion ratio (WMD = &#8722;0.111). The inclusion of EOs in small ruminants&#8217; diets decreased (p &lt; 0.05) ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentration (WMD = &#8722;0.310 mg/dL), total protozoa (WMD = &#8722;1.426 &#215; 105/mL), methanogens (WMD = &#8722;0.60 &#215; 107/mL), and enteric methane emissions (WMD = &#8722;3.93 L/d) and increased ruminal propionate concentration (WMD = 0.726 mol/100 mol, p &lt; 0.001). The serum urea concentration was lower (WMD = &#8722;0.688 mg/dL; p = 0.009), but serum catalase (WMD = 0.204 ng/mL), superoxide dismutase (WMD = 0.037 ng/mL), and total antioxidant capacity (WMD = 0.749 U/mL) were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in response to EOs supplementation. In meat, EOs supplementation decreased (p &lt; 0.05) the cooking loss (WMD = &#8722;0.617 g/100 g), malondialdehyde content (WMD = &#8722;0.029 mg/kg of meat), yellowness (WMD = &#8722;0.316), and total viable bacterial count (WMD = &#8722;0.780 CFU/g of meat). There was higher (p &lt; 0.05) milk production (WMD = 0.113 kg/d), feed efficiency (WMD = 0.039 kg/kg), protein (WMD = 0.059 g/100 g), and lactose content in the milk (WMD = 0.100 g/100 g), as well as lower somatic cell counts in milk (WMD = &#8722;0.910 &#215; 103 cells/mL) in response to EOs supplementation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with EOs improves productive performance as well as meat and milk quality of small ruminants. In addition, EOs improve antioxidant status in blood serum and rumen fermentation and decrease environmental impact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) is a common surgery performed for CCLD. A modified, simplified technique (TTA Rapid) is also reported to have very good clinical outcomes. In this paper, we report a modified TTA Rapid technique to treat a CCLD in a dog with an amputated contralateral hindlimb. A 5-year-old mixed breed dog presented with amputated right hindlimb and difficulty walking. Pain and positive drawer sign were present at manipulation of left stifle joint. Radiographic findings of the stifle joint confirmed the presence of moderate osteoarthritis associated with CCLD, and modified TTA Rapid procedure was performed. Recovery from surgery was uneventful, and the dog was able to stand by his own by the second day postoperative. At three months follow-up evaluation, the dog was free of lameness and the osteotomy site was completely healed.

Results: The pathological diagnosis identified 679 lymphomas, 122 carcinomas, 28 sarcomas, 23 polyps, 7 MCT and 1 leiomyoma. Carcinomas and polyps were most commonly found in the large intestine, lymphomas were most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine and MCT only occurred in the small intestine. Besides the well-described small-cell, mitotic count &lt;2 T-cell lymphomas and the large-cell B-cell lymphomas with a high mitotic count, several variants of lymphomas were identified. The values of miRNA-20b were found to be up-regulated in samples of all types of cancer, whereas miRNA-192 was only up-regulated in carcinomas and B-cell lymphomas. Conclusions: The histopathological and immunohistochemical (sub-)classification of feline intestinal masses confirmed the occurrence of different tumour types, with lymphoma being the most frequent neoplasm. Novel biomarkers such as miRNA-20b and miRNA-192 might have diagnostic potential in feline intestinal neoplasms and should be further investigated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study aimed to assess the reliability of 2D-SWE for evaluating the elastosonographic appearance of the distal attachment of the fetlock joint capsule (DJC) in sound horses and in horses with osteoarthritis (OA) (2). According to a thorough evaluation of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ), adult horses were divided in a sound Group (H) and in OA Group (P). Thereafter, a 2D-SWE of MCPJs was performed. Shear wave velocity (m/sec) and Young's modulus (kPa) were calculated independently by two operators at each selected ROI. Statistical analysis was performed with R software. (3) Results: 2D-SWE had good-excellent inter-CC and intra-CC in both groups. Differences in m/s and kPa between Groups H and P were found in transverse scans with lower values in Group P. No correlation with age or DJC thickness was found. (4) Conclusions: 2D-SWE was repeatable and reproducible. In Group H, DJC was statistically stiffer than in Group P only in transverse scan. The technique showed poor sensitivity and specificity in differentiating fetlocks affected by OA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There are numerous reports of adverse pulmonary effects following intravenous (IV) injection; however, adverse effects following subarachnoid injection (SAI) are underreported. An adult Merino wether was one of eighteen animals anaesthetised during an experimental trial modelling intervertebral disc injury. The animal was premedicated with methadone 0.1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.3 mg/kg IV. Anaesthesia was induced using alfaxalone IV and it was maintained using isoflurane, delivered in 100% oxygen by controlled mechanical ventilation. An SAI of xylazine 0.05 mg/kg diluted to 1 mL with 0.9% saline was performed at the lumbosacral site prior to recovery. This resulted in rapid narcosis, oxygen dependency and ventilatory compromise. Treatment with frusemide 1 mg/kg IV and salbutamol 0.2 mg inhaled did not attenuate the adverse cardiopulmonary effects. A rapid improvement in all physiological variables was seen following high dose atipamezole 0.05 mg/kg IV. This case report adds to the current knowledge regarding the risk for potential side effects when using alpha2 receptor agonists, such as xylazine, for the sedation or regional analgesia in sheep.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Certain AMR bacteria circulate between humans, animals, and the environment, while AMR genes can be found in all ecosystems. The aim of the present review was to provide an overview of antimicrobial use in food-producing animals and to document the current status of the role of farm animals in the spread of AMR to humans. The available body of scientific evidence supported the notion that restricted use of antimicrobials in farm animals was effective in reducing AMR in livestock and, in some cases, in humans. However, most recent studies have reported that livestock have little contribution to the acquisition of AMR bacteria and/or AMR genes by humans. Overall, strategies applied on farms that target the reduction of all antimicrobials are recommended, as these are apparently associated with notable reduction in AMR (avoiding co-resistance between antimicrobials). The interconnection between human and animal health as well as the environment requires the acceleration of the implementation of the 'One Health' approach to effectively fight AMR while preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data about feline L. infantum adaptive immune response are scant. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and immune response in cats and dogs from the same endemic area of canine leishmaniosis. Stray cats (109) and rescued dogs (59) from C&#243;rdoba (Spain) were enrolled. Data about their exposure to L. infantum were analyzed by detection of parasite DNA, measurements of Leishmania-specific interferon-&#947; (whole blood assay in 57 cats and 29 dogs), and antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence antibody test). An overall L. infantum prevalence of 30.5% in dogs and 30% in cats were found according to serology and PCR tests. Prevalence was 44.8% in dogs and 35.1% in cats tested also for interferon-&#947; production. Dogs showed higher anti-L. infantum antibody levels compared to cats. More than one-third of cats had contact with or were infected by L. infantum and they may contribute to the endemicity of leishmaniosis in the investigated region. The immunopathogenesis of feline L. infantum infection has similarities with dogs but cats show a lower level of adaptive immune response compared to dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As yet, an evidence-based understanding of incisor occlusal surface angle dynamics and normocclusal range is missing. Orthodontic measuring devices could help unravel this information objectively but imply measurement validation. We evaluated intra- and interexaminer variability of repeated sagittal and transversal incisor occlusal surface angle measures using a commercial orthodontic gauge device (MaPHorse1). Five examiners (two experienced, three inexperienced) measured six cadaver heads on 2 consecutive days in a blinded block-randomization design, resulting in 16 measures per examiner*head. Sagittal and transversal angle measures revealed low intraexaminer variability at scale-level independent mean SDs of &#945; 0.58&#176; and &#945; 0.69&#176;, respectively. Sagittal angle measures associate with low interexaminer variability, showing small mean angle differences (max. &#945; 0.51&#176; &#177; 0.35&#176;), small scatter, and more consistent data reproducibility. Despite comparable mean interexaminer differences, the spread of transversal angle measures was relevantly higher using the proposed landmarks (average 2.2-fold higher interquartile range). The measurement performance of experienced and inexperienced examiners did not systematically differ. The time required for individual measurements was already comparable after 24/96 repetitions. This instrument may help deciphering sagittal angle normocclusal range and orthognathic dynamics and, with a proposed procedural amendment, transversal angle as well.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It can metastasise to lymph nodes (LNs), and this adversely affects the prognosis and treatment. The study aims to evaluate the SLN mapping of MCTs with radiographic indirect lymphography. Dogs that underwent clinical staging were prospectively enrolled. Lipiodol was injected around the MCT or the surgical scar. After 24 h, LNs that picked up contrast were radiographically assessed. Twenty-six dogs with 29 MCTs were included. MCTs were confirmed histologically, while SLNs were evaluated either by cytology and/or histology. SLNs were detectable in 23 dogs with 26 MCTs. Lymphatic vessels were visible in 19 MCTs. In nine MCTs, at least two SLNs picked up contrast. In particular, seven MCTs involved two SLNs, and two MCTs involved three different SLNs. In nine MCTs, at least a SLN was metastatic. This study indicates that the lymph drainage pattern of the MCTs may be different for each MCT, and more than one SLN can be involved. Indirect lymphangiography with Lipiodol allowed the detection of the SLN in 90% of MCTs. This provided clinically relevant information to remove the LN and stage the patient.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Scarce reports among current publications detail the growth of testes and ST morphometry among juvenile chicks. Therefore, this study aims to investigate changes in components occurring in Gallus domesticus testes, by assessing the GSI and morphologically and histologically evaluating the testes and ST morphometry from 1-wk- to 4-mo-old. Right and left testes were collected from 70 healthy chickens divided into seven age-related groups (n = 10) and then immersed into the alcoholic acetate formalin (AAF) fixative solution. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissues were used for microscopic observations. The findings revealed that both testes exhibited smooth features from 1-wk-old to 1-mo-old, and thereafter showed a consistent increase in vascularization until 4-mo-old. Histologically, both testes exhibited unclear ST, with ST apoptotic resorption observed in the 1-wk-old chicks. Until 1-mo-old, ST formed and few spermatogonia differentiated into primary spermatocytes, with all spermatogenic cells observed at 3-mo-old, i.e., sexual maturity. These findings suggest that both testes develop in analogy, and their sizes including increases in length and diameter are related to the spermatogenic activity in the ST. Subsequently, ST resorption by apoptosis is assumed to participate in the physiological mechanism regulating germ cells (GC). Finally, the GSI tended to increase with growth.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals were housed individually in raised wire-mesh pens, with individual water troughs and feeders. Lambs were randomly divided into three groups (n = 7) that received different doses of Hura crepitans seeds: 4 g/kg B.W. (group 1), 6 g/kg B.W. (group 2) and 0 g/kg B.W. (control group or group 0). The treatment was administered at the beginning of the experiment once orally and the study lasted 21 days. Stool samples were taken for quantitative analysis of oocysts using the McMaster technique and blood for haematological and biochemical analysis. Lambs that received the seeds showed a higher excretion of coccidia oocysts between days 5 and 7 after treatment (p &lt; 0.05) due to the antiparasitic effect of these seeds, without affecting their productive performance (daily feed intake (DFI)- total weight gain (TWG), daily weight gain (DWG)). In addition, the daily feed consumption (DFC) and dry matter intake (DMI) were similar between the groups. The analysed enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT and FA) and creatinine showed reference values. Only the urea and BUN levels were slightly increased, but without statistical difference between the groups. Therefore, the Hura crepitans seed, at doses of 4 and 6 g/kg, favours the expulsion of coccidial oocysts, without affecting either the health or the productive behaviour of lambs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal activity of different concentration of authorized (phoxim, ByeMite&#174;, 500 mg/mL) and unauthorized (fipronil, Frontline&#174; 250 mg/100 mL spray) molecules on 14 field isolates of D. gallinae collected from different ornamental poultry farms from different Italian regions. The sensitivity test was performed by contact exposure to four concentrations of each insecticide diluted at 1:5 (10,000-2000-400-80 ppm for phoxim, 500-100-20-4 ppm for fipronil) on a filter paper. The effectiveness of the treatment was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) associated with the dose of the pesticide used. Considering the mean lethality, phoxim has greater efficacy compared to fipronil (p &lt; 0.001). A great variability of lethality rate was observed with the increase in fipronil dilution; conversely, for phoxim, some outliers were observed, particularly in one farm, suggesting the hypothesis that a certain degree of resistance in the mite population could occur possibly as a consequence of the continual contact with the molecule. This underlines the importance of the use of licensed products administered at correct dosages and the need for alternative molecules to avoid the onset of drug resistance phenomena.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis is considered relevant and is commonly reported in poultry products. Evaluating innovative approaches for resisting colonization in animals could contribute to the goal of reducing potential human infections. Microalgae represent a source of molecules associated with performance and health improvement in chickens. Tetraselmis chuii synthesizes fermentable polysaccharides as part of their cell wall content; these sugars are known for influencing caecal bacterial diversity. We hypothesized if its dietary administration could exert a positive effect on caecal microbiota in favor of a reduced S. Infantis load. A total of 72 one-day-old broiler chickens (COBB 500) were randomly allocated into three groups: a control, a group infected with bacteria (day 4), and a group challenged with S. Infantis but fed a microalgae-based diet. Caecal samples (n = 8) were collected two days post-infection. A PMAxx[TM]-based qPCR approach was developed to assess differences regarding bacterial viable load between groups. The inclusion of the microalga did not modify S. Infantis content, although the assay proved to be efficient, sensitive, and repeatable. The utilized scheme could serve as a foundation for developing novel PCR-based methodologies for estimating Salmonella colonization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At equipotent dosages, oral methylprednisolone is believed to cause less PUPD than prednisolone. We performed a pilot randomized, open, parallel trial with 22 dogs with nonseasonal AD receiving either prednisolone or methylprednisolone at equipotent dosages, once daily for 14 days during the first phase of a restriction-provocation dietary trial. Before and on days 3, 7, and 14 after starting the glucocorticoids, owners estimated water consumption for 24 h. On the same days and before the glucocorticoid was given, owners collected the first-morning urine to determine the urine specific gravity (USG). There were no significant differences between the prednisolone and methylprednisolone groups on days 3, 7, and 14 when comparing the changes in water intake from baseline. Most dogs from both groups exhibited a slight reduction in USG during the study. Still, there was no significant difference in USG changes between the groups on any of these three reevaluation days. In conclusion, the administration of two weeks of oral prednisolone and methylprednisolone at equipotent anti-inflammatory dosages at the beginning of an elimination diet did not lead to significant differences in water intake and USG.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Early nutrition strategies such as in ovo intervention can be an alternative means to support growth and gut health by compensating for the energy deficit after pipping out of the egg. In the current study, 1200 Ross 308 eggs were used to examine the effects of a complex carbohydrate solution of disaccharides and glucose applied in ovo on hatchability, the hatching time of different-sized eggs, and the development, performance, and carcass characteristics of broilers of both sexes. The eggs were divided into three treatment groups: intact (NT), in ovo saline (ioS), and in ovo carbohydrate mixture (ioCH). The incubation protocol was performed according to the recommendations of Aviagen (2019), and the in ovo process was carried out on day 17 by manually injecting 0.5 mL of the solutions into the amniotic fluid. After hatching, the birds were kept in floor pens until day 35 and fed ad libitum in a three-phase feeding program. Body weight, average daily weight gain, feed intake and conversion, and carcass characteristics were measured during the trial. In ovo carbohydrates reduced hatchability by 15%, while growth performance and the weight of thigh and breast muscle were enhanced significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared with ioS as a possible outcome of carbohydrate-to-muscle satellite cell proliferation and protein accumulation. However, further study is needed to refine the in ovo carbohydrate supplementation method to minimize the mortality of embryos during hatching.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of ITD mutations in exons 8 and 11 of c-kit in canine subcutaneous MCTs and to investigate its association with histologic grade, KIT pattern, and proliferation markers. ITD mutations in exons 8 and 11 of c-kit, mitotic count, Ki67 index, AgNOR number, Ki67xAgNOR score, KIT pattern, and histologic grade (two-tier system) were retrospectively recorded for 216 dogs with subcutaneous MCTs. ITD mutations in exons 8 and 11 of c-kit were detected in 23 (10.6%) and 12 (5.56%) subcutaneous MCTs, respectively. Exon 11 mutations were significantly associated with Kiupel high grade (p &lt; 0.001) and increased mitotic count (p &lt; 0.001) compared to subcutaneous MCTs with no mutations in exons 8 or 11 (p = 0.002) or subcutaneous MCTs with a mutation in exon 8 (p = 0.001). There was no significant association of either c-kit mutation with KIT patterns or proliferation activity. This study identified a higher prevalence of ITD mutations in exons 8 and 11 of c-kit in subcutaneous MCTs than previously reported. Like their cutaneous counterpart, subcutaneous MCTs with exon 11 mutations were more likely to be histologically high grade and have a higher mitotic count, whereas such associations were not observed in subcutaneous MCTs with exon 8 mutations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A minority of bovine EPEC belong to one of the ten classical serotypes of human and bovine AE-STEC. The purpose of this study was to identify five non-classical O serotypes (O123/186, O156, O177, O182, and O183) among bovine EPEC and to characterize their virulence repertoires by whole genome sequencing. Around 40% of the 307 EPEC from 307 diarrheic calves, 368 EPEC from 47 healthy cattle, and 131 EPEC from 36 healthy calves in dairy farms were analyzed. Serotype O177 was the most frequent among EPEC from diarrheic and healthy calves, while the O156 was the most frequent in healthy cattle. The genomic analysis identified different H serotypes, MLSTypes, and/or eae gene subtypes among the O156 and O177 EPEC, while the O182 was homogeneous. The virulence gene profiles of bovine EPEC were closely related to each other and to the profiles of ten bovine and human AE-STEC. These results emphasize the need for additional studies to identify more O:H serotypes of bovine EPEC and to elucidate their origin and evolution of EPEC with regard to AE-STEC belonging to the same O:H serotypes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>36136711</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Implication of Netrin-1 Gain of Expression in Canine Nodal Lymphoma.</Title>	<Abstract>Netrin-1 is a member of the laminin superfamily, and is known to interact with specific receptors, called dependence receptors. While upon netrin-1 binding these receptors initiate positive signaling, in absence of netrin-1, these receptors trigger apoptosis. Tumor cells can avoid apoptosis by inactivating these receptors or by gaining ligand expression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of netrin-1, the ligand of dependence receptors, in canine healthy lymph nodes (LN), and in lymphomas and to evaluate efficiency of a netrin-1 interfering compound in cell cultures from canine lymphoma. Thirty-two control LN and 169 lymphomas were analyzed through immunohistochemistry. Netrin-1 was expressed in the nucleoli of lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells in controls. Acquisition of a cytoplasmic expression was present in B-cell lymphomas (23.1 % in low-grade and 50.6% in high-grade) and T-cell lymphomas (50.0 % in low-grade and 78.8 % in high-grade), with a significant difference between the high- and low-grade in B-cell lymphomas. Through flow cytometry, we showed a significant increase in netrin-1 expression in either high-grade B-cell and T-cell lymphomas (19 and 5, respectively) compared with healthy LN (5), likewise an RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated a significant increase in netrin-1 expression level in 14 samples of lymphomas compared with eight samples of healthy LN. A T-cell aggressive canine lymphoma cell line and four primary canine nodal lymphomas cell cultures were treated with a netrin-1 interfering antibody. Apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity was significantly increased in the cell line and viability was decreased in three of the four primary cell cultures. Together, these data suggest that netrin-1 expression is increased in lymphoma, and more specifically in high-grade lymphomas, and that netrin-1 can act as a survival factor for the neoplastic cells, and so be a therapeutic target.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin system and participates in apoptosis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate changes in piglet serum Ang II levels following intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) vaccination with a commercial PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. The trial was conducted in a commercial pig farm, including 104 piglets which were randomly allocated to four groups: Group A-Porcilis PRRS ID, Group B-Porcilis PRRS IM, Group C-Diluvac ID and Group D-Diluvac IM. The study piglets were either vaccinated or injected at 2 weeks of age and they were tested by qRT-PCR for PRRSV and by ELISA for Ang II. The results indicated differences in viremia of tested piglets at 7 weeks of age, while piglets at 10 weeks of age were all found qRT-PCR positive for PRRSV. In addition, significant differences were noticed in Ang II in 7-week-old piglets. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that ID vaccination induces less tissue damage, based on the lower measurements of Ang II in the serum of ID vaccinated piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While well studied in several domestic species, MCTs are rarely documented in rodents. A three-year-old, male African dormouse (Graphiurus sp.) presented with a history of vomiting and anorexia for 3 months. Sonography revealed thickened gastric mucosa and hyperperistalsis. The patient died after receiving symptomatic treatment for 2 months. At necropsy, locally extensive, pale, thickened mucosal foci obscuring the first half of the stomach lumen was noted. Histological examination revealed moderately polymorphic, round, oval to spindle cells with amphophilic cytoplasmic granules infiltrating the mucosa to tunica muscularis, with moderate numbers of eosinophils. The mucosa was severely ulcerated with the proliferation of granulation tissue. The granules in most tumor cells exhibited metachromasia with the toluidine blue stain. Neoplastic cells revealed positive membranous immunoreactivity to KIT. Herein, we report the first case report of MCT in dormouse but also the first gastrointestinal MCT in a rodent species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

So far, no complete overview exists of the array of clinical aspects of HS in specific dog breeds in large groups. Therefore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of HS in a population of Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMD; n = 365) and Flat-Coated Retrievers (FCR; n = 289), which are two of the most affected dog breeds. Cases were selected from databases from different pathology services, and clinical information was retrospectively collected for each case. Localized HS was reported significantly more frequently in the FCR (60.6%) than in the BMD (39.2%), and disseminated HS was recorded significantly more frequently in the BMD (60.8%) than in the FCR (39.4%). Lameness was seen more often in FCR than in BMD, and the vast majority (78.1%) of LHS leading to lameness was located in the front legs in the FCR, while in the BMD, there was a more even distribution. BMD had significantly more often leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, even corrected for the type of HS, than FCR. No significant difference in the frequency of anemia was recorded between BMD and FCR. In those dogs in which blood examination was performed, hypercalcemia was diagnosed in 15 BMD, while none of the FCR had hypercalcemia. The new information provided in this study can aid the diagnostic process and allow for prompt treatment recommendations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36136715</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Redox Status and Hematological Variables in Melatonin-Treated Ewes during Early Pregnancy under Heat Stress.</Title>	<Abstract>The preovulatory follicles and preimplantation stage embryos are found to be rather sensitive to heat stress due to their low potential for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of melatonin administration on redox status and hematological variables during the preovulatory period and early stages of embryogenesis in heat-stressed ewes in vivo. Forty Karagouniko-breed ewes were divided in two groups, the melatonin (M, n = 20) group and control (C, n = 20) one. All animals were subjected to heat stress throughout the study, which lasted forty days (D0 to D40). In M group, melatonin implants were administered on D0. Then, oestrous synchronization was applied (D19-D33). On D34, six rams were introduced into the ewe flock for mating. Ultrasonographic examination was conducted on D73 for pregnancy diagnosis. The temperature humidity index (THI), the rectal temperature (RT), and the number of breaths per minute (BR) were evaluated twice daily. Redox biomarkers, namely total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione (GSH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), were assayed in blood samples collected on D0, D33, and D40. In addition, packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cells (WBCs), leukocyte differential count, and cortisol assessment were conducted in blood samples on D33 and D40. The results indicated improved fertility rate and mean number of lambs born per ewe due to improved redox status (p &lt; 0.05) in ewes that received melatonin implants 34 days approximately before the onset of oestrus. The PCV decreased in both groups between the two time-points (p &lt; 0.05). However, the NEU/LYMPH ratio decreased (p &lt; 0.05) only in group M. The low cortisol levels and the decreased NEU/LYMPH ratio in both groups support the hypothesis that ewes of the indigenous Karagouniko breed may exhibit adaptation to environmental thermal stress. The administration of melatonin as an antioxidant regime may improve the reproductive competence of heat stressed ewes and may also enhance their ability to adapt at high ambient temperatures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Prior work has shown that both mother and fetus operate via the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-p110&#945; signalling pathway to modify placental development, function, and fetal growth outcomes. This study in mice used genetic inactivation of PI3K-p110&#945; (&#945;/+) in mothers and fetuses and high resolution respirometry to investigate the influence of maternal and fetal PI3K-p110&#945; deficiency on fetal and placental growth, in relation to placental mitochondrial bioenergetics, for each fetal sex. The effect of PI3K-p110&#945; deficiency on maternal body composition was also determined to understand more about the maternal-driven changes in feto-placental development. These data show that male fetuses were more sensitive than females to fetal PI3K-p110&#945; deficiency, as they had greater reductions in fetal and placental weight, when compared to their WT littermates. Placental weight was also altered in males only of &#945;/+ dams. In addition, &#945;/+ male, but not female, fetuses showed an increase in mitochondrial reserve capacity, when compared to their WT littermates in &#945;/+ dams. Finally, &#945;/+ dams exhibited reduced adipose depot masses, compared to wild-type dams. These findings, thus, demonstrate that maternal nutrient reserves and ability to apportion nutrients to the fetus are reduced in &#945;/+ dams. Moreover, maternal and fetal PI3K-p110&#945; deficiency impacts conceptus growth and placental mitochondrial bioenergetic function, in a manner dependent on fetal sex.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This pilot study evaluated the overall distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors in the pig respiratory and intestinal tract. All the receptors evaluated in this study were expressed and differentially distributed through the respiratory and intestinal tract. The presence and expression levels of these receptors could determine susceptibility to coronavirus infections. This study may have important implications for the development of research models and the assessment of the potential risk and introduction of novel coronaviruses into the swine population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the relationship between remission mechanisms and microbiome changes has not been elucidated yet. The main objective of this study was to report the clinical effects of oral freeze-dried FMT in CE dogs, comparing the fecal microbiomes of three groups: pre-FMT CE-affected dogs, post-FMT dogs, and healthy dogs. Diversity analysis, differential abundance analysis, and machine learning algorithms were applied to investigate the differences in microbiome composition between healthy and pre-FMT samples, while Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI) changes and microbial diversity metrics were used to evaluate FMT effects. In the healthy/pre-FMT comparison, significant differences were noted in alpha and beta diversity and a list of differentially abundant taxa was identified, while machine learning algorithms predicted sample categories with 0.97 (random forest) and 0.87 (sPLS-DA) accuracy. Clinical signs of improvement were observed in 74% (20/27) of CE-affected dogs, together with a statistically significant decrease in CCECAI (median value from 5 to 2 median). Alpha and beta diversity variations between pre- and post-FMT were observed for each receiver, with a high heterogeneity in the response. This highlighted the necessity for further research on a larger dataset that could identify different healing patterns of microbiome changes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36136719</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Detection of Chicken Respiratory Pathogens in Live Markets of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Epidemiological Implications.</Title>	<Abstract>A moderate to high seroprevalence of exposure to Newcastle disease (NDV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) has recently been reported in Ethiopia, but it is unclear to what extent these contribute to clinical cases of respiratory disease. This study investigated the presence of these pathogens in chickens exhibiting respiratory disease in two live markets in Addis Ababa. Markets were visited weekly for three months, and 18 chickens displaying respiratory clinical signs were acquired. Swab samples were taken from the choana, trachea, air sac and larynx for bacteriology and PCR tests targeting these five pathogens. PCR-positive samples were sequenced. All 18 chickens were PCR-positive for aMPV, 50% for each of Mg and NDV, 39% for IBV and 11% for ILTV. Infections with &gt;3 pathogens were detected in 17 of 18 chickens. Potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus were found in 16 to 44% of chickens. IBV-positive samples were of the 793B genotype. The results associate the presence of these organisms with clinical respiratory disease and are consistent with recent serological investigations, indicating a high level of exposure to multiple respiratory pathogens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We applied a semi-quantitative evaluation to identify outcomes and assess the degree of One Health implementation. Differences emerged in the surveillance initiatives, as well as the One Health scores. The Dutch surveillance is dominated by a high level of transdisciplinary and trans-sectoral collaboration, enabling communication and data sharing among actors. Different project-based monitoring, research and educational activities are centrally coordinated and the non-scientific community is actively involved. All this yielded measurable health outcomes. In Italy and Spain, TBD surveillance and reporting systems are based on compulsory notification. Law enforcement, alongside dedicated time and availability of economic resources, is fragmented and limited to the most severe health issues. Veterinary and human medicine are the most involved disciplines, with the first prevailing in some contexts. Stakeholders are marginally considered and collaborations limited to local initiatives. Research activities have mostly contributed to gaining knowledge on the distribution of tick vectors and discovery of new pathogens. Although all TBD surveillance plans comply with EU regulations, initiatives characterised by transdisciplinary collaboration may be more effective for the surveillance and prevention of TBD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Previous studies in human and veterinary medicine have shown the clinical efficacy of LLLT in many fields. In this study, the literature was reviewed using the critically appraised topic (CAT) method to determine the canine skin diseases for which LLLT is an advisable treatment. A meticulous literature search revealed 19 significant clinical trials, which were critically analyzed. The evaluation of the best accessible evidence in July 2022 suggests that fluorescence biomodulation (FBM), a type of LLLT, can, in combination with systemic antibiotic therapy, be a promising and effective adjunctive treatment for canine interdigital pyoderma and canine deep pyoderma. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the use of LLLT is not recommended as a therapy for pedal pruritus secondary to canine atopic dermatitis. For other canine skin diseases included in the CAT, although LLLT appears to be a promising treatment, there is not yet good scientific evidence to recommend its use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sonoelastography is an emerging technology that is able to define the stiffness of the tissue and has promising applications in the evaluation of mammary gland lesions. In the present study, strain elastography (STE) and shear-wave (SWE) elastography were compared in 38 mammary nodular lesions for their ability to define the histopathological features of canine mammary lesions. Among the techniques, SWE showed better repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.876), whereas STE was found to be only acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.456). Mammary nodular lesions showed a wide range of tissue stiffening with a similar mean value for STE and SWE in benign (4 &#177; 0.3 and 115.4 &#177; 12.6 kPa, respectively) and malignant lesions (3.8 &#177; 0.1 and 115.5 &#177; 4.5 kPa, respectively). A significant correlation was found between lesion fibrosis and STE (STE-I: r = 0.513, p &lt; 0.001; STE-R: r = 0.591, p &lt; 0.001) or SWE-S (r = 0.769; p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, SWE was reliable and correlated with fibrosis and was similar for both benign and malignant lesions, suggesting that other collateral diagnostic techniques should be considered in conjunction with SWE to characterize mammary nodular lesions in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the accurate effects and underlying mechanism of marginal zinc deficiency on ETEC infection are not fully understood. Here, a marginal zinc-deficient mouse model was established by feeding mice with a marginal zinc-deficient diet, and ETEC k88 was further administrated to mice after antibiotic disruption of the normal microbiota. Marginal zinc deficiency aggravated growth impairment, diarrhea, intestinal morphology, intestinal permeability, and inflammation induced by ETEC k88 infection. In line with the above observations, marginal zinc deficiency also increased the intestinal ETEC shedding, though the concentration of ETEC in the intestinal content was not different or even decreased in the stool. Moreover, marginal zinc deficiency failed to change the host's zinc levels, as evidenced by the fact that the serum zinc levels and zinc-receptor GPR39 expression in jejunum were not significantly different in mice with ETEC challenge. Finally, marginal zinc deficiency upregulated the relative expression of virulence genes involved in heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins, motility, cellular adhesion, and biofilm formation in the cecum content of mice with ETEC infection. These findings demonstrated that marginal zinc deficiency likely regulates ETEC infection through the virulence factors, whereas it is not correlated with host zinc levels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the role of the retroviral co-infection in the impairment of feline clinical health is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate hemogram changes in cats from regions endemic for both Li and FIV infection. Four hundred and ninety-six cats tested for Li (EDTA blood polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence antibody test) and for FIV infection (enzyme-linked immune assay) were retrospectively evaluated. Hemogram results including blood smear morphological evaluation were statistically compared considering four infection patterns: Li+FIV+, Li+FIV-, Li-FIV+, and Li-FIV-. Significantly lower values of erythrocytes (Li+FIV-: p = 0.0248; Li-FIV+: p = 0.0392) and hemoglobin (Li+FIV: p = 0.0086; Li-FIV+: p = 0.0249) were found in both infections when compared to Li-FIV- cats, and severity of anemia was more frequently moderate in Li-positive cats (p = 0.0206) and severe in FIV infection (p = 0.024). Li infection was associated with monocytosis (p = 0.0013) and morphologically activated monocytes (p = 0.0209). Moreover, FIV infection was associated with the presence of inflammatory leukogram (p = 0.023), and an association between thrombocytosis and the co-infection was found (p = 0.0347). Li infection in cats induces hematological changes compatible with chronic inflammation, some of which are due to co-infection with FIV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this context, an epidemiological study of Trichinella infection was carried out in the northeastern part of Romania to investigate for the first time the prevalence of this infection in pigs, horses, wild boars and bears, the geographical distribution of Trichinella species and the natural reservoir of Trichinella infection. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 166,270 animals were examined by the method of artificial digestion, in order to calculate the annual and general prevalence of Trichinella infection, according to the host and the Trichinella species involved, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), trendline and geographical distribution of species of the genus Trichinella. Taxonomic framing was performed by the multiplex PCR method. The overall prevalence of Trichinella infection in animals was 0.188%. Within the host species, the prevalence varied as follows: in pigs 0.096%, horses 0.021%, wild boar 1.46% and bears 36.76%. The geographical distribution showed that T. spiralis was dominant, occupying the entire northeastern part of Romania, being identified in pigs, horses, wild boars and bears. T britovi occupied five mountain counties, being identified only in wild boars and bears. These results validate the presence of T. spiralis and T. britovi in domestic and game animals in the northeastern part of Romania.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288123</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Facilitating Development of Problem-Solving Skills in Veterinary Learners with Clinical Examples.</Title>	<Abstract>This paper seeks to open discussion on the teaching of problem-solving skills in veterinary learners. We start by defining the term problem before discussing what constitutes problem-solving. For veterinary medical learners, problem-solving techniques are similar to those of decision-making and are integral to clinical reasoning. Problem-solving requires the veterinary learner to organize information logically to allow application of prior or new knowledge in arriving at a solution. The decision-making must encompass choices that provide the most beneficial and economical approach. In a modification of an existing protocol, we suggest the inclusion of the 5 elements: (1) define the problem list; (2) create an associated timeline; (3) describe the (anatomical) system involved or the pathophysiological principle applicable to the case; (4) propose management for the case; and (5) identify unique features of the case. During problem-solving activities, the instructor should take the role of facilitator rather than teacher. Skills utilized in the facilitation of problem-solving by learners include coaching, differential reinforcement, effective feedback, modelling and 'think out loud'. Effective feedback must inform learners of their progress and performance, as this is fundamental to continued learning and motivation to succeed. In order to put the above into context, we end with an example case scenario showing how we would approach the teaching of problem-solving to veterinary learners.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cat experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures, altered mentation, mild proprioceptive ataxia, and circling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed two round, solitary, well-delineated, space-occupying lesions suggestive of multiple meningiomas in the right frontal and occipital lobes. Before surgery, patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) printed models and guides were produced using a 3D program based on MRI and computed tomography (CT), and a rehearsal surgery was performed. With a 3D guide to find the location of the craniotomy lines, bilateral extended rostrotentorial craniotomy allowed en bloc resection of multiple meningiomas. The bone fragment was replaced and secured to the skull with a craniofacial plate and screws with an artificial dura. All of the surgical steps were performed without complications. The preoperative presenting signs were resolved by the time of follow-up examinations 2 weeks after surgery. Twelve months after the removal of the multiple meningiomas, the cat survived without further neurological progression. For the resection of multiple meningiomas, surgery can result in large bone defects and risk of massive hemorrhage. For this challenging surgery, patient-specific 3D models and guides can be effective for accurate and safe craniotomies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to analyze their genetic relationship, which identified 16 clusters. Serovar 2 (50 isolates), serovar 13 (25 isolates), serovar 9 (11 isolates), and serovar 16 (7 isolates) were the most frequent serovars. Serovar 2 formed nine distinguishable clusters; serovar 13 and serovar 16 were less diverse, exhibiting two potentially related subclusters; serovar 9 was represented by a single cluster. Remarkably small differences were seen in the core genome when nine representative isolates of serovar 13 were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Tetracycline resistance was relatively frequent in the two clusters of serovar 13; one of them was also frequently resistant against beta-lactams. Resistance in other serovars was sporadic. All isolates carried the apxIV gene. The toxin profiles of serovar 2 were characterized by the production of ApxII and ApxIII toxins, except for a small cluster of three isolates: serovar 9 and serovar 16 isolates produced ApxI and ApxII toxins. Serovar 13 carried apxII and apxIBD genes, indicating the production of the ApxII toxin, but not of ApxI or ApxIII. The unusually high frequency and low diversity of serovar 13 are not explained by its virulence properties, but the high frequency of resistance to beta-lactams and tetracyclines may have played a role in its spread. The emergence of serovar 16 may be facilitated by its high virulence, also explaining its high clonality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The test substance 2.4-dinitrophenol (2.4-DNP) is an agent for destroying oxidative phosphorylation. 2.4-DNP shuts off the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from oxidation and then, the respiration rate increases. If the respiratory chain is damaged, there is little or no response to adding 2.4-DNP. The aim of this study was to analyze the respiratory activity and oxidative phosphorylation in semen before and after freezing and compare the obtained data with the fertilizing ability of sperm. There was a reduction in sperm respiration rates in all species after thawing. The respiration of spermatozoa of boars, bulls, stallions, reindeers and chicken showed responses to 2.4-dinitrophenol. The only difference is in the strength of the response to the test substance. After freezing and thawing, respiratory stimulation by 2.4-DNP decreased. The results of our study show that respiration rate is not correlated with pregnancy rates and egg fertility. However, there was a high correlation between the stimulation of respiration by 2.4-dinitrophenol and pregnancy rates. The test for an increase in respiration rate after adding 2.4-dinitrophenol could be a suitable test of the fertilizing ability of sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present paper is to describe the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and histopathological and immunophenotypical characteristics of a cerebral cortex ganglioglioma in a 7-year-old Border Collie. The dog presented an acute onset of tonic-clonic epileptic seizures. MRI revealed a well-defined large intra-axial mass located on the left forebrain, mainly affecting the frontal cortex. Following humane euthanasia, the histopathological examination of the mass revealed a diffuse proliferation of neoplastic glial cells mixed with anomalous neuronal bodies. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the presence of two different populations of neoplastic cells. Most neoplastic glial cells were immunoreactive to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the other subset of neoplastic cells were positive to neuronal markers such as PGP 9.5, synaptophysin (SYN) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), suggestive of neuronal cells. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of a cerebrocortical ganglioglioma. To the authors knowledge, this is the first description of a ganglioglioma of the cerebral cortex in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

General anesthesia is usually required in neuroimaging studies of NHPs to keep the animal from stress and motion. However, the adverse effects of anesthesia on cerebral physiology and neural activity are pronounced and can compromise the data collection and interpretation. Functional connectivity is frequently examined using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to assess the functional abnormality in the animal brain under anesthesia. The fMRI signal can be dramatically suppressed by most anesthetics in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, rsfMRI studies may be further compromised by inter-subject variations when the sample size is small (as seen in most neuroscience studies of NHPs). Therefore, proper use of anesthesia is strongly demanded to ensure steady and consistent physiology maintained during rsfMRI data collection of each subject. The aim of this review is to summarize typical anesthesia used in rsfMRI scans of NHPs and the effects of anesthetics on cerebral physiology and functional connectivity. Moreover, the protocols with optimal rsfMRI data acquisition and anesthesia procedures for functional connectivity study of macaque monkeys are introduced.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Traditionally, ovariohysterectomy was considered the elective treatment for pyometra, but in some cases, such as breeding subjects or patients with a high anesthesiologic risk, medical treatment is preferred. Aglepristone is a progesterone receptor blocker and its use proved to be effective for the medical treatment of pyometra in bitches and queens. The aim of this work is to report the effectiveness, in the feline species, of a modified aglepristone administration protocol. Five intact queens were referred to veterinary care centers for pyometra. Aglepristone (15 mg/kg) was administered at D0, D2, D5, and D8, as described by Contri and collaborators for dogs. An antibiotic treatment (marbofloxacin, 3 mg/kg) was associated, and uterine conditions were checked with regular ultrasonographic exams. The uterus returned to its normal condition 10 days after starting the treatment and no adverse effects were reported. After treatment, three queens had an uneventful pregnancy. Even if the treated group was restricted and homogeneous, the proposed modified protocol proved to be useful and promising for the medical treatment of pyometra in cats; further studies are planned to verify its effectiveness in the long-term prevention of recurrence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288131</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Stuttering Priapism in a Dog-First Report.</Title>	<Abstract>A 5-year-old recently castrated male Doberman dog presented for prolonged erection of one week's duration with associated pain and dysuria. This was the fourth episode within a year. Each episode was associated with an unusual event, which was stressful for the dog. Castration performed two months prior to the final episode did not prevent recurrence. Due to tissue necrosis, penile amputation and urethrostomy had to be performed. The dog recovered fully. Prolonged erection that persists beyond or that is unrelated to sexual stimulation is called "priapism". This term refers to the Greek god Priapus, a god of fertility, memorialized in sculptures for his giant phallus. In humans, depending on the mechanism involved, priapism is classified as nonischemic or ischemic. Because prognosis and treatment are different, priapism must be determined to be nonischemic or ischemic. Nonischemic priapism is a rare condition observed when an increase in penile arterial blood flow overwhelms the capacity of venous drainage; it is often associated with penile trauma, and does not require medical intervention. Ischemic priapism is associated with decreased venous return. In humans, ischemic priapism accounts for 95% of cases, the majority of which are idiopathic. Ischemic priapism is a urological emergency; simple conservative measures such as aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa and intracavernosal injection of an adrenergic agent are often successful. Stuttering priapism, also called recurrent or intermittent priapism, is a particular form of ischemic priapism reported in humans that is characterized by repetitive episodes of prolonged erections. Management consists of treating each new episode as an episode of acute ischemic priapism, and preventing recurrence with oral medications such as dutasteride and/or baclofen, gabapentin, or tadalafil. To the authors' knowledge, this case is the first report of stuttering priapism in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to measure chronic and acute physiological parameters of stress in ten securely and ten insecurely attached dogs. The twenty experimental subjects were selected from a sample of dogs that participated with their owners in the Strange Situation Procedure. Saliva samples were collected before (T0) and after (T1) the test. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and rectal temperature were measured after the test, only. At this time, a hair sample was also collected. RM ANOVA was used to analyse cortisol concentrations between secure and insecure dogs at T0 and T1. Mann-Whitney U test or T test were used for other physiological parameters. Insecure dogs had significant higher salivary cortisol concentrations than secure dogs at T1 (p = 0.024), but only a non-significant trend towards higher cortisol concentrations at T0 (p = 0.099). Post-test heart rate also tended to be higher in insecure compared to secure dogs (p = 0.077). No significant differences in hair cortisol concentration were found. The quality of attachment may affect the dog's physiological response to acute stress, at least when related to separation from the caregiver.

The intramuscular group (IMG) received 0.003 mg kg&#8722;1 dexmedetomidine, 2 mg kg&#8722;1 ketamine, and 0.2 mg kg&#8722;1 midazolam while the intrarectal group (IRG) protocol was 0.003 mg kg&#8722;1 dexmedetomidine, 4 mg kg&#8722;1 ketamine, and 0.4 mg kg&#8722;1 midazolam. Cardiorespiratory values, temperature, and sedation score were measured 2 min after administration and then every 5 min up to the 40th minute. Cats belonging to IRG reacted less strongly to the drug, as opposed to those receiving intramuscular administration (2/10 in IRG vs. 8/10 in IMG). Average time between drug administration and standing position was 44.9 &#177; 5.79 in IRG and 57 &#177; 9.88 min in IMG. In IRG, maintenance of SpO2 values is &gt;95% at each time point. Median and range peak of sedation {7 (5)} in IMG occurs at 20th, 25th, and 30th minutes post drug administration while was lower in IRG. Cardiorespiratory values were slightly lower in IMG than in IRG, but always constant in both treatments. Temperature did not differ between groups. At this dosage, although sedation score was higher in IMG, intrarectal route could be efficacious for performing minimally invasive clinical and diagnostic procedures in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288134</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Application of MALDI-TOF MS for a Variability Study of Paenibacillus larvae.</Title>	<Abstract>In recent decades, the significant deterioration of the health status of honey bees has been observed throughout the world. One of the most severe factors affecting the health of bee colonies worldwide is American foulbrood disease. This devastating disease, with no known cure, is caused by the Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria of Paenibacillus larvae species. At present, DNA-based methods are being used for P. larvae identification and typing. In our study, we compare two of the most advanced DNA-based technologies (rep-PCR and 16S rRNA analyses) with MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting to evaluate P. larvae variability in Central Europe. While 16S rRNA analysis presents a very limited variation among the strains, MALDI-TOF MS is observed to be more efficient at differentiating P. larvae. Remarkably, no clear correlation is observed between whole-genome rep-PCR fingerprinting and MALDI-TOF MS-based typing. Our data indicate that MALDI-TOF protein profiling provides accurate and cost-effective methods for the rapid identification of P. larvae strains and provides novel perspectives on strain diversity compared to conventional DNA-based genotyping approaches. The current study provides a good foundation for future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Particularly in the UK, recent evidence suggests that the infection is endemic in dairy cattle. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the disease with the aim to disentangle the relationship between the heterogeneity in the shedding routes and their effect on the environmental contamination. We develop a mathematical model for the transmission of Q fever within UK cattle herds by coupling the within-herd infection cycle of the disease with farm demographics and environmental effects, introduced by either the indoor or outdoor environment. Special focus is given on the mechanism of transmission in nulliparous heifers and multiparous cattle. We calibrate the model based on available knowledge on various epidemiological aspects of the disease and on data regarding farm demographics available in the UK DEFRA. The resulting model is able to reproduce the reported prevalence levels by field and in silico studies, as well as their evolution in time. In addition, it is built in an manner that allows the investigation of different housing techniques, farm management styles and a variety of interventions. Sensitivity analysis further reveals the parameters having the major effect in maintaining high prevalence levels of seropositive and shedding cattle. The present analysis aims also to indicate the gaps in the available data required to optimise the proposed model or future models that will developed on the basis of the one proposed herein. Finally, the developed model can serve as mathematical proof for the assessment of various interventions for controlling the dynamics of Q fever infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to determine the serotonin values in 43 dogs, divided into three different experimental variants: (1) between two groups of medium (n = 6) and small (n = 4) breed shelter dogs; (2) in dogs with (n = 15) and without (n = 10) owners after administration of pre-spaying/neutering anesthesia; (3) in different behavioral states (n = 8) classified as follows: M1-happy, M2-aggressive, M3-calmed status, post-exposure to a stressful situation, compared to the reference time referred to as M0. There were no significant differences (p &#8805; 0.05) regarding the serotonin values between the two groups of medium and small breed shelter dogs. Following anesthesia, the average mean serotonin values were significantly lower (p &#8804; 0.003), by 63.85 ng/mL, in stray dogs compared to dogs with owners. No significant differences (p &#8805; 0.05) were found when comparing the reference time M0 to M1, M2, and M3. The differences decreased significantly (p &#8804; 0.05), by 89.61 ng/mL, between M1 and M2 and increased significantly (p &#8804; 0.008), by 112.78 ng/mL, between M2 and M3.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Estrogen receptors (ER-&#8733;, ER-&#946;), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR), have been previously identified on human osteosarcoma (OSA) cells, and are considered to influence tumor growth, but their expression and role in canine OSA is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize sex hormone receptor expression levels in naturally occurring OSA tissue and in three canine OSA cell lines. The expression of ER-&#945;, ER-&#946;, PR, and AR was investigated using RT-PCR. PR expression levels were also quantified in OSA cells cultured under hypoxic conditions or in the presence of estradiol. The effects of progesterone on cell proliferation were quantified. Results demonstrated varying expression levels of these receptors in five OSA subtypes. OSA cell lines demonstrated high gene expression levels of PR and low gene expression levels of ER-&#945; and ER-&#946; and no gene expression of AR. PR expression was increased in OSA cells cultured under hypoxic conditions in a HIF-&#8733; independent manner. Interestingly, one cell line expressed very high levels of PR, expression of which decreased in response to estradiol. In addition, progesterone decreased OSA cell proliferation in this particular cell line. Further investigation of the role of sex steroids, particularly PR and its ligands, in regulation of canine OSA is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288138</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Novel Diagnostic Techniques and Biomarkers of Canine Mammary Tumors.</Title>	<Abstract>Canine mammary tumors (CMTs) are considered a serious clinical problem in older bitches. Due to the high malignancy rate and poor prognosis, an early diagnosis is essential. This article is a summary of novel diagnostic techniques as well as the main biomarkers of CMTs. So far, CMTs are detected only when changes in mammary glands are clinically visible and surgical removal of the mass is the only recommended treatment. Proper diagnostics of CMT is especially important as they represent a very diverse group of tumors and therefore different treatment approaches may be required. Recently, new diagnostic options appeared, like a new cytological grading system of CMTs or B-mode ultrasound, the Doppler technique, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and real-time elastography, which may be useful in pre-surgical evaluation. However, in order to detect malignancies before macroscopic changes are visible, evaluation of serum and tissue biomarkers should be considered. Among them, we distinguish markers of the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, metastatic potential and prognosis, hormone receptors, inflammatory and more recent: metabolomic, gene expression, miRNA, and transcriptome sequencing markers. The use of a couple of the above-mentioned markers together seems to be the most useful for the early diagnosis of neoplastic diseases as well as to evaluate response to treatment, presence of tumor progression, or further prognosis. Molecular aspects of tumors seem to be crucial for proper understanding of tumorigenesis and the application of individual treatment options.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288139</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Toothed Whales Have Black Neurons in the Blue Spot.</Title>	<Abstract>Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment that is located mostly in the human substantia nigra, and in the locus ceruleus, referred to as "the blue spot". NM increases linearly with age, and has been described mainly in the human brain; however, it also occurs in the neurons of monkeys, horses, giraffes, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, rats, and even in frogs. While in most of these mammals NM shows the histochemical and ultrastructural features typical of lipofuscins, human NM is confined within cytoplasmic organelles that are surrounded by a double membrane, suggesting an autophagic origin. In a study on the morphology of the locus ceruleus of the family Delphinidae, the presence of a variable quantity of NM in the interior of locus ceruleus neurons was observed for the first time; meanwhile, nothing is known about its ultrastructure and composition. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated in two toothed whales-an Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis; family Delphinidae) and a Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris; family Ziphiidae)-the presence of melanin granules associated with lipid droplets and membranes that were very similar to that of human NM. The relationship between NM and neuronal vulnerability must be studied in depth, and cetaceans may offer a new natural-spontaneous comparative model for the study of NM and its implication in neurodegenerative diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288140</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Exploring a Possible Link between the Fecal Microbiota and the Production Performance of Pigs.</Title>	<Abstract>The backfat thickness of pigs not only affects the physical properties and taste of meat, but it also closely relates to the reproduction performance of sows. Accumulating evidence indicates that, apart from genetic factors, gut microbiota can also modulate the fat deposition and muscle growth. However, the differential microbiota in pigs with different backfat thickness, and whether microbiota affects backfat thickness, remains elusive. Firstly, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing was performed on 62 fecal samples from pigs with different backfat thicknesses, and the compositions of microbiota among different groups with different backfat thicknesses were different. The abundance of Lactobacillus. reuteri (L. reuteri) and Prevotella sp RS2 was significantly higher in pigs with low-backfat thickness than that in pigs with middle and high-backfat thickness; meanwhile, the abundance of Desulfovibrio piger was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in pigs with low-backfat thickness. Furthermore, the functional profiling of microbial communities suggested that the abundance of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and styrene degradation were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the low-backfat thickness group than that in middle and high-backfat thickness groups. Finally, L. reuteri fed to Meishan piglets was capable of improving the production performance and had the potential to reduce backfat thickness. This study provides new evidence that microbiota can regulate the phenotype of the host, and dietary supplementation with L. reuteri can improve the production performance of piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The virus isolate was identified by gene sequence analysis and Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). The bacterial isolate was identified by biochemical tests, 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and species- and serotype-specific PCR, and the pathogenicity was analyzed. Porcine circovirus type 2a (PCV2a) genotype from the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes and Pasteurella (P.) multocida capsular serotypes D from the lungs were found. The PCV2a isolates could specifically bound the anti-PCV2-Cap polyclonal antibody. The 16S rDNA sequence of P. multocida isolates had 99.9% identity with that of the strain from cattle, and the isolate was highly pathogenic to mice. The results showed that the co-infection of PCV2a and P. Multocida capsular serotypes D should be responsible for the disease. The uncommon PCV2a is still prevalent in some pig farms besides the dominant PCV2d genotype. This study could provide important etiological information for effective control and treatment of the disease in pig farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Similarly, two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) is an advanced echocardiographic technique that is becoming increasingly important for the assessment of myocardial function. Breeds, age, and body weight (BW) are known to be important factors affecting the echocardiographic parameters; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of breed, age, and BW on the echocardiographic parameters in three breeds of clinically healthy Retrievers. A total of 46 Retrievers, including 16 Flat-coated Retrievers (FR), 16 Golden Retrievers (GR), and 14 Labrador Retrievers (LR) were included in the study. The comparison of the breeds revealed significant differences in the LV wall thickness of FR and GR, although further analysis using MLR showed that the differences were most likely associated with BW, similarly to the other LV dimensions. Functional parameters, including ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and left-atrial-to-aortic ratio, were independent of breed, age, and BW. On the other hand, peak aortic blood flow velocity, trans-mitral rapid ventricular filling flow, and the ratio of trans-mitral rapid ventricular filling flow to atrial contraction were influenced by age. The 2D-STE-derived radial and circumferential strain parameters were independent of breed, age, and BW, except for global strain in the radial direction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have multilineage differentiation and anti-inflammatory potential, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can inhibit the target gene expression, which make them suitable for ameliorating RA. The current study was aimed to explore the effect and potential mechanisms of siRNAs targeting IL-1&#946;/TNF-&#945; combined with BMSCs transplantation in ameliorating RA in rats.</Abstract><Abstract>Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model rats were randomly divided into five groups: PBS (Model control group), methotrexate (Positive drug treatment group), BMSCs (BMSCs transplantation group), siRNA (IL-1&#946;/TNF-&#945; siRNAs injection group), siRNA + BMSCs (Both IL-1&#946;/TNF-&#945; siRNAs injection and BMSCs transplantation group). After treatment for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 days, the ameliorating effect was comprehensively assessed through results of the body weight, toe swelling value, the immobility time of forced swimming, the serum concentrations of IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945;, knee joint DR-X imaging and pathological analysis as well as of IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945; and NF-&#954;B mRNA expression in spleen tissue. Furthermore, the potential underlying mechanism involving the NF-&#954;B signaling pathways was also explored.</Abstract><Abstract>Compared with the PBS group, BMSCs, siRNA, siRNA + BMSCs treatment groups showed significant lower toe swelling value, immobility time, spleen index, serum contents of IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945;. In addition, the DR-X results showed that the knee carton surface tended to smoothing without bone hyperplasia, suggesting that these three treatments were all able to successfully ameliorate RA symptoms. In addition, compared with the PBS group, the protein expression of p-NF-&#954;B-p65 was significantly reduced in the knees of siRNA + BMSCs rats. BMSCs labeled with BrdU were also found in the knees of rats. Moreover, the mRNA expression of IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945; and NF-&#954;B-P65 in spleen tissue of siRNA + BMSCs rats were all significantly inhibited.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results demonstrated for the first time that siRNA + BMSCs was able to ameliorate RA inflammation by inhibiting the activation of NF-&#954;B signaling pathways and reducing the erosion of articular cartilage, and siRNA + BMSCs treatment showed synergism effects in helping ameliorating the inflammation and cartilage repair of RA rats. Therefore, the results of our present study provide a new idea for gene and stem cell therapy for RA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is one of the most common complications that occur as a result of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) in dogs. Serotonin (5-HT) can trigger the development of PH. Accordingly, this study investigated the changes in the expression of genes and proteins associated with local 5-HT signaling in the lungs and pulmonary arteries (PA) of dogs with PH secondary to DMVD. Lung and PA tissue samples were collected from the cadavers of fourteen small-breed dogs and divided into normal (n = 4), DMVD (n = 5) and DMVD with PH (n = 5) groups. Gene expression (tph1, slc6a4 and htr2a) was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression of proteins (TPH-1, SERT, 5-HTR2A, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2) was examined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that the expression of genes and proteins evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis in lung and PA tissues did not differ among groups. However, the expression of proteins related to 5-HT signaling tended to be upregulated in PA tissues from DMVD dogs with and without PH. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the overexpression of these proteins in the DMVD and DMVD with PH groups in lung tissue. These findings suggest a local effect of 5-HT signaling in DMVD dogs with and without PH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A goat feeding experiment employed four male crossbreds (Thai Native &#215; Anglo Nubian) aged 12 months and weighing 21.0 &#177; 0.2 kg each. The treatment was conceived as a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square with four specific CoCP levels at 0, 100, 200, and 300 g/day. Dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), and crude protein intake (CPI) were unaffected by the addition of CoCP. However, across treatment groups, there was a linear increase in ether extract intake (EEI) (p &lt; 0.01), neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI) (p = 0.06), and acid detergent fiber intake (ADFI) (p = 0.04), as well as a quadratic effect on DMI% BW (p = 0.04). The findings showed that rumen temperature, pH, ammonia-nitrogen, or pack cell volume did not change with CoCP supplementation. Total volatile fatty acid showed linear effects on acetate (p = 0.03) and was quadratically affected by propionate concentration (p = 0.02), acetate to propionate ratio (p = 0.01), acetic plus butyric to propionic acid ratio (p = 0.01), and methane estimation (p = 0.01). With increased CoCP supplementation, there was a linear decrease in protozoa count by about 20.2% as the amount of CoCP supplemented increased (p = 0.06). CoCP supplementation in animal feed resulted in a linear decrease in urinary nitrogen (p = 0.02) and a quadratic effect on absorbed nitrogen (p = 0.08) among treatment groups, with greater N utilization values found in goats fed 200 g/d CoCP. In light of this, supplementing CoCP into animal feed may improve animal digestion and rumen fermentation effectiveness while having no effect on feed intake, rumen microbes, or blood metabolites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Each miRNA is a short sequence of non-coding RNA that influences countless genes' expression and, thereby, contributes to several physiological pathways and diseases. It has been demonstrated that miRNAs participate in the development of many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This review synopsises the most recent studies emphasising miRNA's influence in several CVDs affecting dogs and cats. It provides a concise outline of miRNA's biology and function, the diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers, and their role in different CVDs. It also discusses known and future roles for miRNAs as potential clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets. So, this review gives a comprehensive outline of the most relevant miRNAs related to CVDs in Veterinary Medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our present research aimed to investigate the outcome of inclusion of different levels of protein concentrate in rations of Ayrshire dairy cows in relation to the rumen microbiome, reproductive traits and economic value. Forty-five Ayrshire cows were divided into three groups (15 in each). The first control group 0 AM was fed the basal ration, while the second 1 AM and third 2 AM groups were fed the basic ration with the sunflower cake replaced by different levels of protein concentrate Agro-Matic (1 and 1.5 kg/head/day, respectively). Ruminal fluid samples, reproductive parameters and economic value were studied. During the early lactation period, 120 days in milk (DIM), the number of pathogenic microorganisms decreased in both the 1 AM and 2 AM groups when compared with the control group 0 AM; moreover, a significant decrease in Peptococcus bacteria was recorded in the 1 AM group, while Fusobacterium decreased in the 2 AM group. At the end of lactation, the total number of cellulolytic bacteria increased with the use of protein concentrate in animals of the 1 AM group when compared with the control group. Regarding undesirable bacteria, the 2 AM group recorded the highest value for Lactobacilli and Actinobacteria when compared with the 0 AM group (0.18 and 8.90 vs. 0.04 and 4.24), and the differences were significant (p &lt; 0.05). The insemination index and the duration of the days open period decreased in the 2 AM group, while the differences were p &gt; 0.05. The profitability of milk production increased by 2.76% and 6.28% in both supplemented groups, and the differences compared to the 0 AM group were significant. We conclude that the supplementation of Agro-Matic caused no deviations from the normal standards of cellulolytic, amylolytic, transit and pathogenic bacteria, no impact on reproductive functions and significantly improved the profitability of the milk production process of Ayrshire dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on a sample of 16,272 cancer records, including 3266 cats and 13,006 dogs, collected from January 2019 to December 2021 in the Vet-OncoNet Network database, this study aimed to compare the tumor malignancy profile between cats and dogs, considering animal-related factors (sex, age, and breed), topography, and geographic location using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Cats had a higher proportion of malignant tumors (78.7%) than dogs (46.2%), and the malignancy profile was very different regarding tumors' topographies. The mean age of malignant tumors occurred eight months later than benign ones (9.1, SD = 3.4; 9.8, SD = 3.2), in general. Species (OR = 3.96, 95%CI 3.57: 4.39) and topography (MOR = 4.10) were the two most important determinants of malignancy risk. Female dogs had a higher risk than male dogs (OR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.08: 1.31), which does not appear to be the case in cats (OR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.77: 1.23). Breed contributed significantly to differences in malignancy risk in dogs (MOR = 1.56), particularly in pit bulls and boxers. District of residence was not so relevant in predicting malignancy risk (MOR = 1.14). In both species, the risk of malignancy increased by approximately 20% every three years. It could be hypothesized that species differences in genetic structure may contribute to tumor malignancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Of the 373 articles reviewed, 16 fulfilled the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Three independent reviewers extracted the data, and vaccine effectiveness was assessed using the outcomes of interest. The majority of studies had a low or unclear risk of bias as assessed using the ARRIVE guidelines. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the vaccination resulted in statistically significant reductions in bacterial fecal shedding (odds ratio, OR = 0.122, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.054&#8722;0.278) and mortality rate (risk ratio, RR = 0.199; 95% CI, 0.066&#8722;0.605). Furthermore, ADWG was significantly increased in the vaccinated pigs compared to the unvaccinated controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.606, 95% CI 0.243&#8722;0.969). In the subgroup analysis, the production phase and study type significantly influenced the effect size (p &lt; 0.1). The Egger&#8217;s regression test showed no evidence of publication bias (p &gt; 0.1). The effectiveness of commercially available vaccines against PPE-related weight loss, fecal shedding, and mortality suggests that the vaccines may help control PPE on affected swine farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One accepted mechanism is autonomic imbalance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) on cardiac autonomic control, cardiac structure and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The CMS model provides a more realistic simulation of daily stress. The animals were divided into control and CMS, and were exposed to 4-week mild stressors. The electrocardiogram recording, sucrose intake and parameters related to stress, cardiac alterations and RAAS were determined. The results showed that CMS had lower body weight and higher sucrose intake. The heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that CMS increased autonomic activity without affecting its balance. The increased RAAS activity with upregulated angiotensin type 1 receptor mRNA expression was shown in CMS. The increased sympathetic activity or RAAS was correlated with stress. Moreover, the altered cardiac structure (i.e., heart weight and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area) were correlated with stress-, sympathetic- and RAAS-related parameters. These indicated that CMS-induced cardiac hypertrophy was the result of both sympathetic and RAAS activation. Therefore, it could be concluded that 4-week CMS in male rats induced negative emotion as shown by increased sucrose intake, and increased cardiac autonomic and RAAS activities, which may be responsible for mild cardiac hypertrophy. The cardiac hypertrophy herein was possibly in an adaptive, not pathological, stage, and the cardiac autonomic function was preserved as the autonomic activities were in balance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288153</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Current Trends in Diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis of Canine Insulinoma.</Title>	<Abstract>The most common pancreatic tumour in dogs is the insulinoma. Canine insulinomas are considered to be malignant in more than 95% of the cases because they almost always tend to metastasise. The diagnosis of an insulinoma requires the demonstration of the simultaneous occurrence of hypoglycaemia and blood insulin levels that are within or above the high end of the reference interval. The staging of canine insulinomas is preferably conducted by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. In general, surgical treatment is the most effective because of it results in long survival times, but many dogs also require medical treatment at some point. The prognosis of canine insulinomas is guarded as clinical hypoglycaemia almost always returns due to metastasis or tumour regrowth. This review aims to provide a summary and update the current recommendations in the veterinary literature for the diagnosis, treatment and prognostication of canine insulinomas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Surgery and radiotherapy are established treatment approaches with similar median survival time, whereas conventional chemotherapy is burdened by severe adverse effects. Spinal and leptomeningeal spread of gliomas have been described following radiotherapy treatment alone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome for four dogs with primary high-grade gliomas in the forebrain without evidence, at diagnosis, of neoplastic invasion along the spinal cord, that were treated with concomitant chemotherapy (temozolomide) and hypofractionated volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT-RT). Temozolomide was selected for its radiosensitive properties, and radiotherapy dose protocols of 37 Gy in 7 fractions or 42 Gy in 10 fractions were used. After an initial complete or partial response, tumors recurred across the cranial-spinal pathway. Post-mortem macroscopic examinations confirmed swollen spinal cord and hyperemic meningeal sleeve, with nodular lesions on the meningeal surface. Microscopically, infiltration of the spinal cord and meninges by neoplastic cells (with features of oligodendrogliomas) were observed. This work seems to suggest that the entire central nervous system should be investigated in diagnostic examinations of canine gliomas. Dose-escalation trials and/or spinal cord prophylaxis treatment could also be evaluated to prevent tumor progression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since then, the abrupt increase of LSD cases was observed throughout the country as outbreaks have spread rapidly to 64 out of a total of 77 provinces within four months. Blood, milk, and nodular skin samples collected from affected animals have been diagnosed by real-time PCR targeting the p32 gene. LSDV was isolated by primary lamb testis (PLT) cells, followed by Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, and confirmed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of a skin lesion showed inclusion bodies in keratinocytes and skin epithelial cells. Phylogenetic analyses of RPO30 and GPCR genes, and the whole genome revealed that Thai viruses were closely related to the vaccine-derived recombinant LSDV strains found previously in China and Vietnam. Recombination analysis confirmed that the Thai LSDV possesses a mosaic hybrid genome containing the vaccine virus DNA as the backbone and a field strain DNA as the minor donor. This is an inclusive report on the disease distributions, complete diagnoses, and genetic characterisation of LSDV during the first wave of LSD outbreaks in Thailand.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The poor prognosis of some cancer subtypes, both in human and dog, demands more effective therapeutic approaches. A possible strategy is the new anticancer therapy based on immune response modulation through bacteria or their derivatives on canine mammary carcinoma cell lines. The aim of the present study was to analyze the CF33 cell line in terms of basal expression of immune innate genes, CXCR4 expression, and interaction with infectious stressors. Our results highlight that CF33 maintains gene expression parameters typical of mammary cancer, and provides the basal gene expression of CF33, which is characterized by overexpression of CXCR4, CD44, RAD51, LY96, and a non-continuous expression of TP53 and PTEN. No mutations appeared in the CXCR4 gene until the 58th passage; this may represent important information for studying the CXCR4 pathway as a therapeutic target. Moreover, the CF33 cell line was shown to be able to interact with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) (an infective stressor), indicating that these cells could be used as an in vitro model for developing innovative therapeutic approaches involving bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Body condition score (BCS) and cresty neck score (CNS) have been correlated with the development of various diseases. Many of the papers in the literature evaluate the prevalence of obesity and overconditioning in horse populations considering BCS given by owners. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of the owners' estimation of the degree of equine obesity or overconditioning by comparing BCS and CNS provided by each owner and a board-certified vet to a cohort of 259 horses and their agreement based on age, breed, sex, and activity of the animals. Overconditioning was present in 29% and 24% of horses according to the owners and the vet, respectively, and obesity in 2% and 1%, respectively. Agreement between BCS and CNS given by the owners and the vet was slight, with owners scoring horses either lower or higher than the vet. Agreement between the owners and the vet assessment was also influenced by age, breed, sex, and activity of the animals. Education of owners and caretakers to correctly assess BCS and CNS and regular evaluation of the animals throughout the year is important to prevent the development of obesity and overconditioning and related diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Awareness of predisposing and prognostic indicators is useful to adequately inform the owner of the outcome and plan the best treatment. The aim of the study was to identify the variables associated with short-term survival in a cohort of horses referred for colic to a veterinary teaching hospital; (2) Methods: medical records of horses referred for colic from 2016 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate regression models were built to assess the odds ratios of discharge from the hospital, both on the whole sample and in those patients undergoing surgery; (3) Conclusions: Month, time of admission, cardiovascular variables (heart rate on admission and after 3-6 h, packed cell volume, capillary refill time, and mucosal membranes), and presence of gastric reflux were significantly associated with discharge in the univariate regression in all horses and in those surgically treated. In the multivariate regression model, heart rate, packed cell volume, and capillary refill time showed significant association with the outcome in the whole sample. Although comparison between this study and previous studies is difficult due to the number and type of variables included, cardiovascular variables and markers of hypovolemia were also shown to be associated with outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The basis for postoperative AMD and AID administration is empirical and only recently has been questioned. Empirical approaches can be changed, and these changes, along with the description of their outcomes, can help produce appropriate stewardship. The aim of this study is to report the changes in AMD and AID regimens in horses undergoing emergency laparotomy at a referral teaching hospital between 2017 and 2021. Signalment, pathology, surgery, prophylactic AMD and AID administration were obtained from the medical records. Difference in AMD and AID regimens throughout the study period were also reported. In 234 postoperative records considered, ninety-two horses received prophylactic AMD, while 142 received pre-operative antimicrobials only. There was a progressive change in regimens throughout the years, increasing the number of AID molecules used. AMD and AID administration in horses has changed in our practice over the years to modulate therapies according to the postoperative complications that eventually arise. In this study, horses not receiving postoperative routine AMD treatment did not show an increased incidence of complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In humans, an understanding of the oncogenome of different cancer types has proven critical and is deeply interwoven into all aspects of patient care, including diagnostics, prognostics and treatments through the application of targeted therapies. Investigations into understanding the genetics of feline cancers started with cytogenetics and was then expanded to studies at a gene-specific level, looking for mutations and expression level changes of genes that are commonly mutated in human cancers. Methylation studies have also been performed and together with a recently generated high-quality reference genome for cats, next-generation sequencing studies are starting to deliver results. This review summarises what is currently known of the genetics of both common and rare cancer types in cats, including lymphomas, mammary tumours, squamous cell carcinomas, soft tissue tumours, mast cell tumours, haemangiosarcomas, pulmonary carcinomas, pancreatic carcinomas and osteosarcomas. Shining a spotlight on our current understanding of the feline oncogenome will hopefully serve as a springboard for more much-needed research into the genetics of cancer in domestic cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We report a recent case of a ten-year-old male cat with a white-hair coat and mesenchymal neoplasms of both auricles. Cytology, complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemistry and imaging examinations were performed. After surgery, the samples underwent routinary histopathology and were additionally stained with orcein. A routine analysis yielded values within a normal range and the imaging examination showed no abnormalities, suggesting that the bilateral presentation of neoplasms was primary rather than metastatic. The cytology was inconclusive, but, through histopathology, two well-differentiated fibrosarcomas were diagnosed and histopathological changes related to chronic UV exposure (such as epidermal hyperplasia, stratification disorders, keratinocyte dysplasia and an accumulation of elastotic material) were documented in the skin adjacent to the lesions. An orcein stain succeeded in highlighting elastosis. The elastic fibers lost their regular structure and orientation and appeared to be fragmented, wavy to branched and knotted. A morphometric analysis showed that the amount of elastotic material in the dermis close to the tumors was more than double compared with the more distant areas. Elastosis is considered to be a hallmark of photodamage; thus, an involvement of UV rays in the carcinogenic process of the tumors may be suspected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 4-year-old female mongrel dog presented with solitary lymph node enlargement. Significant right prescapular lymphadenopathy and abdominal enlargement were observed during physical examination. A complete blood count revealed lymphocytosis, and a peripheral blood smear revealed lymphoblastosis and Mott cells. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the right prescapular lymph node revealed a predominant population of lymphoblasts and Mott cells. Based on the FNAC and blood smear results, the patient was diagnosed with leukemic state multicentric B-cell lymphoma with Mott cell differentiation. Subsequent PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement and flow cytometry revealed that the patient exhibited cross-lineage rearrangement (CLRA) and lineage infidelity (LI), respectively. CHOP-based chemotherapy was initiated, however, the patient's disease was progressive. The patient died three months after the initial presentation. Mott cell differentiation in canine B-cell lymphoma (MCL) has rarely been reported in the veterinary literature and seems to show an unusual clinical course. To the best of our knowledge, no reports of MCL with CLRA and LI exist. We report the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of MCL with CLRA and LI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eighty high production cows (parity &#8804; 3 and an average milk yield of 36.5 kg/cow/day) from the largest Brazilian dairy herd available were randomly selected; milk quarter samples were collected for microbiological culture (MC) on the day of drying-off (n = 313) and on day 7 post-calving (n = 313). Based on the results of the MC before and after calving, 240 quarters out of 313 were considered healthy, 38 were cured, 29 showed new infections and 6 had persistent infections. Mammary quarters were randomly selected based on intramammary information status and SDCT protocols for bacterial diversity analyses. The bacterial diversity was similar when comparing both healthy and cured quarters submitted to both drying-off protocols. Despite healthy cows that were treated at dry-off using only teat sealant showing no alteration in the alpha and beta bacterial diversity, they did show a higher abundance of bacterial groups that may be beneficial to or commensals of the mammary gland, which implies that antibiotic therapy should be reserved for mammary quarters with a history of mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our recent study indicated that JRTs with GI neoplastic polyps harbor an identical germline variant in the APC gene, c.[462_463delinsTT], in a heterozygous state. Unlike sporadic cases, dogs afflicted with hereditary GI polyposis can be expected to have a prolonged survival time, as hereditary tumors are noninvasive. Since the discovery of this disease, the number of newly diagnosed cases in Japan has increased, allowing us to update the clinical and pathological features and provide a large number of diagnostic images. The present clinical case series study employing various diagnostic imaging techniques revealed that some of the cases harbored tumors in the small intestine in addition to the stomach and colorectum. Moreover, although rare, hereditary GI cancers can progress to the advanced stage and develop systemic metastasis, similar to sporadic GI tumors. These findings indicate that there is a wider range of variation in disease severity than was initially recognized. Our results can contribute to the accurate diagnosis of hereditary GI polyposis in clinical practice, pathological examinations, and future research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we evaluated the suitability of OFs for surveillance purposes concerning Actinobacillus (A.) pleuropneumoniae infections in fattening pigs under field conditions. OFs were examined with an Apx-toxin real-time PCR that detects the genes encoding for Apx I-, Apx III-, and Apx IV-toxin. For this purpose, we conducted a pen-wise collection of OFs over one fattening period from fattening pigs of two farms (farm A and B) with a known history of A. pleuropneumoniae infection. Lung lesions were determined at slaughter to estimate the extend of pulmonary lesions and pleural affection. Apx III- and Apx IV-toxin DNA were present in the OFs of both farms whereas Apx I-toxin DNA was present on farm A only. We were able to detect Apx I-, Apx III-, and Apx IV-toxin DNA in different patterns directly after introduction of the new pigs in the farms and over the entire study period. In summary, or results indicate the suitability of OFS for the early detection and surveillance of A. pleuropneumoniae in fattening farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Five diets consisted of LFD, 25DL, 50DL, 25FL and 50FL, respectively, larval-free, 25%-dried-larvae, 50%-dried-larvae, 25%-fresh-larvae and 50%-fresh-larvae diet, in which 0, 25 and 50% of fishmeal was replaced by dried and fresh larvae, was formulated. A total of 165 local chickens of three weeks old, divided into 15 boxes in batches of 11 animals were raised. The experiment consists of three replications of five treatments. At 14 weeks of age, sixty chickens were slaughtered. Butchery skills and sensory characteristics were evaluated. Thus, a small variation of the ultimate pH from 5.63 to 5.55 between the different types of meat, and a carcass yield around 66%, was recorded. Any effects of substitution rate and physical state of housefly larvae on growth performance was not observed. Feet and proventriculus percentages increased in chickens fed 25% substitution. Liver and spleen percentage, and redder breast meat, increased in chicken fed dried larvae. Yellowness of the breast, thigh-and-drumstick meat and juiciness increased with 50% substitution. There is need of an investigation for liver and spleen enlargement and housefly larvae containing pigments. Thus, housefly larvae up to 50% substitution can be a suitable alternative to fishmeal in local chicken diets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study investigates the risk factors (demographic and clinical) associated with the main clinical causes and methods of death (euthanasia or unassisted death) in a population of dogs. By comparing euthanasia to unassisted deaths, the authors assess causes of death to evaluate their relative impacts on decision-making to choose euthanasia compared with an unassisted death. For this, goal data from electronic medical records of dogs who had died (unassisted death and euthanasia), obtained from an Italian referral veterinary teaching hospital from 2010 to 2020, were analyzed. The causes of death were categorized by pathophysiological process and the organ system. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors that significantly affect the probability of undergoing euthanasia and to individuate independent significant predictors of euthanasia and unassisted death, respectively. Death rate by euthanasia was 40.7% (125/307), by died unassisted 50.8% (156/307), whilst only 8.5% of dogs (26/307) died accidentally. The main causes of death for euthanasia were due to neoplastic (75.6%), degenerative (64.3%), and congenital (60%) diseases. Furthermore, the findings reveal that in deaths by euthanasia, the significant risk predictors were female gender, age, and neoplastic and degenerative processes; while in unassisted deaths, the significant risk predictors were male gender, age, and infection/inflammatory conditions. These preliminary outcomes highlight the information of this study which may be used to evaluate strategic interventions and health promotion strategies to be implemented, with consequent welfare gains for the canine population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is the target of a global eradication campaign led by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The PPR live attenuated vaccine is currently the most widely used and approved vaccine, but the use of this vaccine interferes with the serological testing of the PPR elimination program, and there is a potential safety risk. Viral vector vaccines are one of the most promising methods to solve this dilemma. In this study, the full-length infectious clone plasmid of rabies virus (RABV), pD-SRV9-PM-LASV, was used as the backbone, and the envelope glycoprotein H (hemagglutinin protein) or F (fusion protein) gene of PPRV was inserted into the backbone plasmid to construct the infectious clones pD-SRV9-PM-PPRV-H and pD-SRV9-PM-PPRV-F, which express the PPRV H and PPRV F genes, respectively. The correct construction of these infectious clones was verified after sequencing and double digestion. The infectious clones were transfected with a helper plasmid into BSR/T7 cells, and recombinant viruses were successfully rescued by direct immunofluorescence, indirect immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy and named rSRV9-H and rSRV9-F. The results of growth kinetics studies indicated that the inserted gene did not affect virus proliferation. Stability studies revealed that the inserted target gene was stably expressed in recombinant RABV for at least 15 generations. In this study, the recombinant viruses rSRV9-H and rSRV9-F were successfully rescued. The constructed viruses had good proliferative activity and stability and provided potential bivalent inactivated vaccine candidate strains for the prevention of PPR and livestock rabies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In total 1890 pigs were used for six months: 720 pigs in Farms A and B, respectively and 450 pigs in Farm C. The pigs were equally allocated in three dietary treatments: CON, standard diet in each growing phase; ATT, standard diet that was supplemented with attapulgite at 7 kg/tn of feed; and ATT+, standard diet that was supplemented with 8 kg/tn of feed with a compound product based on attapulgite. Pigs that were fed diets that were supplemented with attapulgite (ATT and ATT+) had significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) and a better feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the control (CON). In conclusion, attapulgite supplementation in the diet of pigs from weaning to slaughter can improve their performance in commercial farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This malignant tumor is locally invasive, has a high mortality rate, and its etiology is not yet known. In humans, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus infection. Herein, a critical review about the potential etiologic factors of FOSCC was performed, considering publications between 2000 and 2022, aiming to synthesize all available scientific evidence regarding this issue. Recommendations of the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane Collaboration were followed and the PubMed database searched by using the MeSH terms MeSH terms "oral", "mouth", "lingual", "labial", "gingiva", "carcinoma", "squamous", and "feline". The selection process for eligible studies was based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and the quality of the studies assessed. The initial search resulted in 553 publications, with only 26 of these being included in the review. Sixteen studies were related to viral etiology and nine related to environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, ectoparasitic products, and the presence of oral comorbidities. When evaluated, feline papillomavirus was detected in 16.2% of samples of FOSCC. In the three studies focused on exposure to tobacco smoke, 35.2% (30/85) of cats with FOSCC had a history of this exposure. The consumption of canned food and the use of deworming collars were associated, in only one publication, with a risk of neoplasia increased by 4.7 and 5.3 times, respectively. Among 485 cats with FOSCC, 6.4% had dental and oral pathology (i.e., periodontal disease or feline chronic gingivostomatitis). The present study demonstrates that the available evidence on the etiology of FOSCC is still limited, however, there has been an increasing interest on this topic. To better understand the role of the possible etiological factors of this aggressive disease, and model for its human counterpart, large, prospective multi-institutional studies are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Amongst the approaches implemented to control and prevent mastitis on dairies are vaccination, pre- and post-milking teat dips, and treatments at dry-off including intramammary antibiotics and teat sealants. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the effect of different treatments at dry-off on the subsequent lactation's milk production and somatic cell count (SCC). A single-blinded controlled block randomized clinical trial was conducted between December 2016 and August 2018 on eight herds from four of the top ten milk-producing counties in California: Tulare, Kings, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin. The trial was repeated with cows enrolled during the winter and summer seasons to account for seasonal variability. Eligible cows were treated at dry-off with either intramammary antibiotics (AB), internal teat sealant (TS), AB + TS, or did not receive any treatment (control), and were followed through 150 days in milk (DIM) post-calving. The milk production and SCC data were extracted from monthly test day milk records (Dairy Comp 305, Valley Ag Software, Tulare, CA, USA). Two-piece spline linear mixed models were used to model the milk production (kg) and natural logarithm-transformed SCC. After accounting for parity, breed, season, and dry period duration, the milk model showed a significant increase in milk production (1.84 kg/day) in cows treated with AB + TS at dry-off in comparison to controls. There was no significant difference in the milk produced by cows that received either AB or TS (0.12 kg/day, and 0.67 kg/day, respectively) in comparison to the untreated cows. Different dry cow treatments were associated with a significant reduction in ln SCC during the first 150 DIM. The greatest reduction was associated with using AB + TS, followed by AB, and finally TS in comparison to controls. Dairies with high SCC may benefit from treating cows at dry-off with AB, TS, or both.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

With no new imminent anthelmintic classes, it is vital to decrease the resistance rate and preserve available classes. Traditional indiscriminate anthelmintic use is not synonymous with a strategic control ideology; however, many continue to implement outdated practices. In comparison to livestock farmers, there have been few social science studies examining horse owner behaviours. This study aimed to understand the perceived barriers faced by horse owners and yard managers to adopting a strategic approach to helminth control, and to explore their experiences. Semi-structured interviews permitted the exploration of the stakeholders' beliefs, opinions, experiences, attitudes, and behaviours. Personal resources, internal influences, and external influences were identified by participants as the barriers to adoption of strategic controls. Two further themes impacting effective implementation of strategic controls emerged surrounding helminth information and source, as well as accurate dosing. Challenges associated with anthelmintic administration and bodyweight estimation suggest that inaccurate dosing is prevalent. Industry-wide implementation of a single 'best practice' could support prescriber decision-making to encourage uptake of effective strategic helminth controls.

This review aimed to know the role of peptides in the field of veterinary diagnosis, and include peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (pELISA), lateral flow devices, and peptide latex agglutination tests that have been developed to detect several pathogens including viruses and bacteria of health and production relevance in domestic animals. Studies in cattle, small ruminants, dogs, cats, poultry, horses, and even aquatic organisms were reviewed. Different studies showed good levels of sensitivity and specificity against their target, moreover, comparisons with commercial kits and official tests were performed which allowed appraising their performance. Chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, and enzymatic synthesis were reviewed as well as their advantages and drawbacks. In addition, we discussed the intrinsic limitations such as the small size or affinity to polystyrene membrane and mention several strategies to overcome these problems. The use of peptides will increase in the coming years and their utility for diagnostic purposes in animals must be evaluated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Morganella morganii is an opportunistic and zoonotic pathogenic bacterium causing serious clinical complications. In this study, we isolated, discovered and characterized M. morganii-infected H. medicinalis. We detected and identified M. morganii in all inflamed and swollen Hirudo medicinalis samples. The 16S rRNA sequence of the isolates confirmed all strains of M. morganii. All strains were sensitive to Ceftriaxone, Ceftiofur, Danofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Enrofloxacin, Oxytetracycline, and Meropenem and were resistant to Erythromycin, Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, Cefazolin, Colistin, Penicillin G, and Lincomycin. This pathogenic bacterium is a zoonotic pathogen, and monitoring the prevalence rate of this bacteria is strongly necessary for leeches used in human medical treatment and care. Finally, all infected leeches were treated successfully in this case report study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 25 swine veterinarians, participants in a previous larger quantitative study, volunteered to be interviewed about their experiences related to the COVID-19 mass depopulation event. Themes that emerged from these interviews included: (1) the need to be better prepared for crisis events; (2) lack of public understanding; (3) moral distress; (4) empathy for others, especially young veterinarians; (5) sources of support; (6) pride, honor and gratitude; and (7) an overarching theme of emotional distancing and detachment-concerns external to one's own mental health. Based on our results, we recommend additional training and supportive services for those who might be involved in future depopulation efforts. Additionally, we suggest that the veterinary profession prioritize public education campaigns to help the public better understand the need for depopulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although several publications have reported the prevalence of murmurs in cats, little information is available in relation to the exact origin of the blood flow turbulences responsible for these murmurs. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of murmurs detected during physical examination in cats.</Abstract><Abstract>Retrospective evaluation of clinical records and echocardiographic examinations performed in cats for investigation of heart murmurs; Results: Records of 856 cats with full clinical information were available for review. The cause of murmur was identified in 93.1% of cases (72.3% with single blood flow turbulence, 26.4% with two, and 1.3% with three identifiable sources of murmur). Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) was the primary cause of murmur in this population (39.2%), followed by dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DRVOTO) (32%) and flow murmurs (6.9%). Most cats with a murmur (56.7%) did not present any structural cardiac abnormality.</Abstract><Abstract>This study indicates that some heart murmur characteristics (timing, loudness and point of maximal intensity) can potentially predict the presence of an underlying cardiac disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

China is one of the largest dairy producers in the world, with millions of Holstein cows. However, there has been no published data on hematology RIs for dairy cows in China yet. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish updated and accurate RIs for Holstein cows in southern China. To increase the accuracy of the RIs, we collected blood samples from 786 Holstein cows and analyzed 25 hematologic variables. The RIs for Holstein cows were established using the 95% percentile RIs according to the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines. The effects of different ages, parities and lactation stages were also checked in this study. The data of 21, 22 and 19 out of 25 hematology parameters were significantly different between different ages, parities and lactation stages, respectively. Furthermore, the hematology RIs of separate subclasses according to different ages, parities and lactation stages were generated. Hematology RIs according to ages and lactation stages, as well as parities and lactation stages, were also assessed. Together, our results confirm that hematology RIs for cows vary by ages, parities and lactation stages. The present study helps to fill the gap in hematology RIs for Holstein cows in southern China, and our data may serve as a very useful tool for monitoring the health and welfare of dairy cattle in China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of lyophilized A-PRF on growth factor release and cell biological activity. Blood samples were collected from six dogs and processed for fresh and lyophilized A-PRF. The growth factors released included transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-&#946;1), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and the fibroblast proliferation as well as wound closure enhancement of both products were compared. The results showed that TGF-&#946;1, PDGF-BB, and VEGFA were continually released from lyophilized A-PRF for over 72 h. Lyophilized A-PRF released significantly more accumulated VEGEA and a tendency to release more TGF-&#946;1 at 72 h as well as VEGFA at 24 h and 72 h than fresh A-PRF. Moreover, lyophilized A-PRF increased fibroblast proliferation and induced a significantly faster wound closure than the control, while no significant difference between fresh and lyophilized A-PRF was found. In conclusion, the lyophilization of canine A-PRF can preserve the release of growth factors and has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. This encourages the substitution of lyophilized A-PRF instead of fresh A-PRF in regenerative treatments in which the stability of the product is concerned.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Candida spp. is a common commensal fungi with higher prevalence and magnitude of growth in humans with T1DM. There is currently no published information about the fungal microbiome in diabetic dogs. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (i) determine whether diabetic dogs were more likely to have Candida spp. or other types of fungi from feces compared to non-diabetic controls, and (ii) identify variables associated with fungi colonization. Fourteen diabetic dogs and 14 age, sex, and breed matched non-diabetic healthy control dogs were included in this prospective case-control study. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used for fungal identification. Diabetic dogs had greater quantitative fungal growth compared to controls (p = 0.004). Moreover, female dogs were more likely to have fungi colonization than males (p = 0.02). All instances of Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. colonization were exclusively identified in diabetic dogs. Serum fructosamine concentration was higher in diabetic dogs with fecal colonization of Candida spp. compared to diabetic dogs without growth (p = 0.03). Our results indicate that the fungal microbiome in feces is altered in diabetic dogs, which seem to favor an increased prevalence of Candida spp. and higher quantitative fungal growth. Moreover, female sex and glycemic control could affect the intestinal mycobiome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study evaluated the outcome of medical treatment in cats with obstructive ureteral stones treated with tamsulosin and identified potential factors predicting spontaneous stone passage. We retrospectively reviewed 70 client-owned cats treated at the Western Referral Animal Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, from 2018 to 2022. All the cats had obstructive ureterolithiasis and were treated using tamsulosin. The baseline characteristics of the cats, stone diameter and location, and stone passage outcomes were analyzed. Stone passage occurred in 22 cats; the remaining 48 cats showed no change in stone locations. Sex, creatinine, and diameter and location of stones were potential risk factors associated with successful stone passage, but age, weight, and side of the stone were not. No serious adverse events related to tamsulosin treatment were observed. This is the first study to identify the risk factors predictive of the spontaneous stone passage of cats with obstructive ureterolithiasis after tamsulosin treatment. Tamsulosin could be an alternative treatment for ureteral obstruction in male cats with smaller distal ureteral stones and low baseline serum creatinine levels. These findings could help develop guidelines for treating feline ureterolithiasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Furthermore, the pH, the moisture and salt concentration were also monitored throughout processing, ripening and storage. Seven cheesemaking trials took place along with the microbiological and physicochemical analysis of the milk, curd and cheese produced. The milk used for the cheesemaking, two curd samples before the heating and two after the heating, two cheese samples at days 3, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 were subjected to microbiological analysis for total mesophilic bacterial count (for milk only), Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Listeria, and Clostridium. The microbiological quality of raw milk was found to be good. It was initially slightly above the EU limit but improvements associated with farm biosecurity and milking equipment hygiene led to a significantly improved milk quality. A small increase in the prevalence of indicator microorganisms in curd and cheese samples was observed for the first few days, followed by a relatively stable condition as manufacturing proceeded and throughout the ripening of the final product. In two cheesemaking trials, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were detected, the first originating from the milk and the second from the environment. The use of good-quality raw milk under sanitary conditions, the application of good manufacturing practices and a maturation period in a controlled environment were found to be the necessary prerequisites for the production of safe raw cheese products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of promoter methylation of the Zona pellucida 2 (ZP2) gene on egg production. Real-time fluorescence quantification showed that the expression of the ZP2 gene in the ovaries of 300-day-old Jinghai yellow chickens in the high-laying group was significantly higher than that in the low-laying group (p &lt; 0.01). A series of deletion fragments of the ZP2 gene promoter in Jinghai yellow chickens had different promoter activities in DF-1 cells, and the core region of the ZP2 gene promoter was found to be between &#8722;1552 and &#8722;1348. Four CpG islands in the promoter region of the ZP2 gene were detected by software prediction. The overall degree of methylation of the ZP2-1 amplified fragment was negatively correlated with mRNA expression to some extent (R = &#8722;0.197); the overall degree of methylation of the ZP2-2 amplified fragment was also negatively correlated with mRNA expression to some extent (R = &#8722;0.264), in which the methylation of methylcytosine (mC)-9, mC-20, and mC-21 sites was significantly negatively correlated with mRNA expression (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the mC-20 and mC-21 sites are located on the Sp1 transcription factor binding site, and it is speculated that these two sites may be the main sites for regulating transcription. In summary, the methylation sites mC-20 and mC-21 of the ZP2 gene may inhibit the binding of Sp1 and DNA, affect the transcription of the ZP2 gene, and then affect the number of eggs produced by the Jinghai yellow chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While slight differences in keratinization were observed in the forestomach, significant differences came to light in the second stomach&#8217;s mucosa. At this level, in Risso&#8217;s dolphin, the principal cells are markedly reduced in size and located externally to the parietal cells, not interspersed between them, compared to bottlenose dolphins; differences were also observed in the structure and concentration of the parietal and principal cells of the gastric body glands (p &lt; 0.0001). The quantitative results of G- and D-cell counts in the gastric mucosa show a clear difference, with a higher concentration of G cells in the mucosa of Risso&#8217;s dolphin (t = 7.334; p &lt; 0.0001) and a higher level of D cells in bottlenose dolphin mucosa (t = 3.123; p = 0.0049). These results suggest that parietal cells undergo greater stimulation by gastrin produced by G cells, with greater acid secretion in G. griseus. Further studies are needed to understand whether an inappropriate diet could lead to severe clinical signs due to gastric acidity in Risso&#8217;s dolphin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Poor colony health is suspected to be the reason for this, but comprehensive disease monitoring programs are lacking to support this notion. We sampled a total of 115 colonies across five different apiaries throughout the Marmara region of Turkey and screened for all of the major bee pathogens using PCR and RNA-seq methods. We found that Varroa mites are more prevalent in comparison to Nosema infections. The pathogens ABPV, DWV, KV, and VDV1 are near 100% prevalent and are the most abundant across all locations, which are known to be vectored by the Varroa mite. We therefore suspect that controlling Varroa mites will be key for improving bee health in Turkey moving forward. We also documented significant interactions between DWV, KV, and VDV1, which may explain how the more virulent strain of the virus becomes abundant. ABPV had a positive interaction with VDV1, thereby possibly facilitating this more virulent viral strain, but a negative interaction with Nosema ceranae. Therefore, these complex pathogen interactions should be taken into consideration in the future to improve bee health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Progressive clinical findings and corresponding ACTH concentrations in horses transitioning to PPID over time have not been documented. Seven horses with ACTH concentrations equivocal for PPID (utilizing locally derived, seasonally adjusted diagnostic-cut off values (DCOV)) and no clinical signs of PPID were selected. Sequential measurement of basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated ACTH concentrations and recording of clinical findings occurred from October 2017 to November 2021 in a prospective case series. In two horses, marked hypertrichosis developed. Although 1/11 basal ACTH concentrations were below DCOV in 2018, subsequently all basal ACTH concentrations in these two horses without treatment were greater than DCOV. One horse was treated with pergolide which normalized basal ACTH concentrations. Four horses developed intermittent, mild hypertrichosis, and one horse never developed hypertrichosis. Basal ACTH concentrations in these five horses were greater than DCOV in 63/133 (47.4%) of testing points. TRH-stimulated ACTH concentrations in these five horses were greater than DCOV in 77/133 (57.9%) of testing points, sometimes markedly increased and greater than the assay upper limit of detection (LoD) of 1250pg/mL. TRH-stimulated ACTH concentrations were most frequently positive in late summer and early autumn, with 24/37 (64.9%) of TRH-stimulated ACTH concentrations greater than the DCOV in February and March. Horses transitioning to PPID can have subtle clinical signs and equivocal ACTH concentrations. However, TRH-stimulated ACTH concentrations can be markedly greater than DCOV, especially in late summer and early autumn (February and March) allowing for identification of subclinical and transitional cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we aimed to classify chicken eggs according to both segmentation and fertility status with a Mask R-CNN-based approach. In this manner, images can be handled by a single DL model to successfully perform detection, classification and segmentation of fertile and infertile eggs. Two different test processes were used in this study. In the first test application, a data set containing five fertile eggs was used. In the second, testing was carried out on the data set containing 18 fertile eggs. For evaluating this study, we used AP, one of the most important metrics for evaluating object detection and segmentation models in computer vision. When the results obtained were examined, the optimum threshold value (IoU) value was determined as 0.7. According to the IoU of 0.7, it was observed that all fertile eggs in the incubator were determined correctly on the third day of both test periods. Considering the methods used and the ease of the designed system, it can be said that a very successful system has been designed according to the studies in the literature. In order to increase the segmentation performance, it is necessary to carry out an experimental study to improve the camera and lighting setup prepared for taking the images.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36288188</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>First Report of Brucella Seroprevalence in Wild Boar Population in Serbia.</Title>	<Abstract>Brucellosis is one of the most important bacterial zoonotic diseases worldwide, characterized in domestic animals by long-term reproductive disorders. As known, wild boars (Sus scrofa) are natural hosts for Brucella suis biovar 2, in which the infection passes in inapparent form, increasing the pathogen transmission risk to domestic pigs, other domestic animals and humans. So far, no studies regarding brucellosis in wild boars in Serbia have been published. During the hunting season 2020/2021, 480 sera of wild boars living in Serbia were collected and tested for the presence of anti-Brucella antibodies. For the serological survey, the Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) were used. Of the 480 sera, 45 sera tested positive, indicating the acquired Brucella seroprevalence in wild boars of 9.4%. The greatest numbers of Brucella seropositive animals were detected in the eastern parts of the country and in one of the central districts, i.e., Pomoravski, Branicevski, Borski and Juznobanatski. This study provides the first data regarding brucellosis in the wild boar population in Serbia, revealing the seroprevalence of Brucella, thus indicating that wild boars as natural hosts and/or vectors of Brucella likely present a risk for the infection of other animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyze the regional seroprevalence of PPV in Tibetan pigs in Tibet and evaluate risk factors related to the disease. A total of 356 serum samples of Tibetan pigs were collected from four counties and districts in Tibet, and anti-PPV antibodies were detected by using a commercial competitive ELISA. Our results show a seroprevalence of 91.01% (324 serum samples were found to be positive for anti-PPV antibodies). The positive rate among different district was 100%, 96.55%, 93.68% and 72.83%, respectively in the Mainling County, in Bayi district, Nang County and Bom&#234; County. We found significant differences between different age and gender groups; particularly female animals show a seroprevalence of 96.03% while the males only 83.46%. From the perspective of the growth stage, our results indicate that subadults show a seroprevalence significative higher than other age groups (100%). This study describes for the first time the PPV seroprevalence among Tibetan pigs characterizing risk factors involved in its transmission and providing information to be taken into account for eventual surveillance or eradication plans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, despite the numerous benefits, there can be intraoperative and postoperative complications which could have important welfare and economic consequences. The aim of this study was to perform a scoping review to identify current evidence on the occurrence, definition and classification of intra and postoperative complications in equine laparoscopy. A scoping review was conducted in scientific databases. Peer-reviewed scientific articles in the English language on laparoscopy in equids between 1992 and 2022 were included. Data on the study method, sample size, surgical procedure, intra and postoperative complications were extracted and charted. One hundred sixty-four articles met the final inclusion criteria. A definition of "intraoperative complication" was given in one study. Difference between "minor" or "major" intraoperative complications were reported in 12 articles and between "minor" or "major" postoperative complications in 22 articles. A total of 22 intraoperative and 34 postoperative complications were described. The most reported intraoperative complication was hemorrhage from ovary or mesovary (12.7%), while the most reported postoperative complications were incisional complications (64.2%) and postoperative pain (32.7%). There is a need for implementation of criteria for defining complications. The adoption of classification systems and standard definitions would help surgeons to make decisions about the most appropriate treatment, and it is also essential to allow comparisons between research results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-four male skeletally-mature Wistar rats were used. Two bone 5 mm critical size defects were created in calvarial bones of each rat. In rats from experimental group I (n = 12), EPO was applied locally on a collagen cone in left defects, whereas a collagen cone soaked with physiological saline was placed in right defects. The rats from experimental group II were injected once intraperitoneally with 4900 IU/kg EPO; a collagen cone was only placed in left defects, whereas the right defects were left empty. The systemic effect of EPO treatment was monitored by haematological analyses on days 0, 30 and 90. Bone healing was monitored via radiography and computed tomography on the same time intervals. The results demonstrated that local EPO application had no significant effect on haemopoiesis, unlike the systemic application. At the same time, it resulted in new bone formation and therefore, could be successfully used as a means of promoting bone regeneration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since aMPV-A was initially reported in Mexico in 2014, there have been no additional reports of its detection in the country. Using nontargeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of FTA card-spotted respiratory samples from commercial chickens in Mexico, seven full genome sequences of aMPV-A (lengths of 13,288-13,381 nucleotides) were de novo assembled. Additionally, complete coding sequences of genes N (n = 2), P and M (n = 7 each), F and L (n = 1 each), M2 (n = 6), SH (n = 5) and G (n = 2) were reference-based assembled from another seven samples. The Mexican isolates phylogenetically group with, but in a distinct clade separate from, other aMPV-A strains. The genome and G-gene nt sequences of the Mexican aMPVs are closest to strain UK/8544/06 (97.22-97.47% and 95.07-95.83%, respectively). Various amino acid variations distinguish the Mexican isolates from each other, and other aMPV-A strains, most of which are in the G (n = 38), F (n = 12), and L (n = 19) proteins. Using our sequence data and publicly available aMPV-A data, we revised a previously published rRT-PCR test, which resulted in different cycling and amplification conditions for aMPV-A to make it more compatible with other commonly used rRT-PCR diagnostic cycling conditions. This is the first comprehensive sequence analysis of aMPVs in Mexico and demonstrates the value of nontargeted NGS to identify pathogens where targeted virus surveillance is likely not routinely performed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This prospective cross-sectional case-control study aimed to evaluate the students' perception of the v-PBLs compared to the traditional veterinary clinical training (t-VCT). The t-VCT consisted of supervised management of clinical cases admitted at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and in the field. The v-PBL consisted of genuine clinical cases shared by tutors throughout an online platform. A survey was delivered to all the fifth-year students who completed the t-VCT or the v-PBL. The survey was completed by 49% of the students. Overall student satisfaction regarding the training experiences was high in both groups, but it was less in the v-PBL than in the t-VCT group. The students of the v-PBL group perceived that they could not improve their practical clinical skills through online sessions, and they emphasized how it could be employed as support for traditional practical activities. All the students are satisfied with the supervision and considered the training correctly focused on relevant learning objectives and the task clearly explained. Stimulating the integration of knowledge and lifelong learning skills replicating life experiences the v-PBLs represented an attractive curricular alternative for veterinary education.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

LPS was intraperitoneally injected from day 14, and then daily for 10 days. For the high stocking density stress model, 174 birds were distributed into three experimental treatments with six replicates per treatment. The treatments were: (1) controls (birds fed basal diet and raised at a stocking density of 14 broilers per m[2]), (2) high-density group (birds fed with basal diet and raised at a stocking density of 22 broilers per m[2]), and (3) high density + CGA group (birds fed with 1 g/kg CGA and raised at a stocking density of 22 broilers per m[2]). Results showed that LPS injection and high stocking density significantly decreased the body weight and feed intake of broiler breeders, while CGA supplementation increased feed intake of broiler breeders under LPS injection and high stocking density stress. Moreover, LPS injection and high stocking density increased the concentration of corticosterone in serum, and CGA addition remarkably downregulated serum corticosterone levels. The GSH level decreased with LPS injection and CGA increased the GSH concentration in the intestines of immune-stressed broiler breeders. LPS injection promoted the production of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (serum IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945;) by 72 h after LPS injection. Dietary supplementation with CGA prevented the increase in serum TNF-&#945; caused by LPS. These results suggest that dietary inclusion of 1 g/kg CGA could increase the feed intake of broiler breeders and alleviate the effects of inflammatory mediator stress and exposure to high stocking density.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The role of HER2 in canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the protein expression and cytogenetic changes of HER2 and their correlation with other clinical-pathological parameters in CMC. We retrospectively selected 112 CMCs. HER2, ER, and Ki67 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. HER2 antibody validation was investigated by immunoblot on mammary tumor cell lines. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with probes for HER2 and CRYBA1 (control gene present on CFA9). HER2 protein overexpression was detected in 15 carcinomas (13.5%). A total of 90 carcinomas were considered technically adequate by FISH, and 8 out of 90 CMC (10%) were HER2 amplified, 3 of which showed a cluster-type pattern. HER2 overexpression was correlated with an increased number of HER2 gene copies (p = 0.01; R = 0.24) and overall survival (p = 0.03), but no correlation with ER, Ki67, grade, metastases, and tumor-specific survival was found. Surprisingly, co-amplification or polysomy was identified in three tumors, characterized by an increased copy number of both HER2 and CRYBA1. A morphological translocation-fusion pattern was recognized in 20 carcinomas (22%), with a co-localized signal of HER2 and CRYBA1. HER2 is not associated with clinical-pathological parameters of increased malignancy in canine mammary tumors, but it is suitable for studying different amplification patterns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to anatomical and surgical difficulties encountered throughout treatment, previously reported techniques including both per-vaginum removal of fetal remnants and ovariohysterectomy were attempted and resulted in novel complications. Fetal bones were unable to be removed completely transcervically due to failure of cervical dilation despite repeated attempts. Subsequent surgical complications such as inadequate exposure of the uterus and incorporation of fetal bones into the uterine stump following ovariohysterectomy also occurred. This case highlights some of the difficulties in managing rare cases of mid-term fetal loss and retention that result in maceration. Ultimately, this may provide useful insights to practitioners when managing similar cases in future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pomace Meal to Substitute Rice Bran on Feed Utilization and Rumen Fermentation in Tropical Beef Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing rice bran with mao pomace meal on feed intake, digestibility, and rumen fermentation in beef cattle. Four crossbred (50% Brahman &#215; 50% Thai native) beef cattle with an initial body weight of 195 &#177; 13 kg and 16 months of age were used in a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design. The dietary treatments included four levels of RB replacement with mao pomace meal at 0, 33, 67, and 100% in concentrate diets. Rice straw was used as a roughage source, fed ad libitum. Replacement of mao pomace meal with rice bran did not affect (p &gt; 0.05) the intakes of concentrate, rice straw, and total dry matter intake. Ether extract intake decreased linearly when increasing the levels of mao pomace meal (p &lt; 0.01). The experimental diets had no effect (p &gt; 0.05) on the digestibility of fiber and crude protein, while dry matter, organic matter, and ether extract digestibility decreased linearly in the group of mao pomace meal replacing rice bran (p &lt; 0.05). Increasing levels of mao pomace meal in concentrate diets did not alter rumen pH, ammonia&#8722;nitrogen, or total volatile fatty acid concentration (p &gt; 0.05). The proportion of propionate increased linearly (p &lt; 0.05), whereas acetate and the acetate to propionate ratio decreased linearly (p &lt; 0.05) when replacing rice bran with mao pomace meal. Moreover, the proportion of propionate was greatest, while acetate was lowest when mao pomace meal was included at 100% in the concentrate diet. In conclusion, the replacement of rice bran with mao pomace meal in a diet could enhance the efficiency of rumen fermentation. Nonetheless, it reduced the digestion of nutrients in tropical beef cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The rapid spread of African swine fever and lumpy skin diseases in south Asia must be considered a wake-up call to prevent the entry, spread, and establishment of new exotic TADs, as south Asia has the highest density of livestock populations, and it will have a huge socioeconomic impact. Regional cooperation for the prevention and control of TADs is necessary, but rational decisions should be made to initiate even sub-regional cooperation in the present geopolitical situation. Cross-border collaboration for surveillance, early warnings, and animal movement control should be encouraged on a bilateral or multilateral basis as many countries share a porous border. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and avian influenza (AI) have been identified as regional priority TADs, and many regional and country initiatives have been undertaken in the last two decades that need to be translated into action. The incursion of exotic TADs into south Asia has compelled us to rethink overall policies and strategies for prevention and control of TADs. This paper took into consideration six emerging and endemic TADs of viral origin to suggest a future course of action.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This retrospective case-control study aims at comparing the prevalence of gastric ulcers in horses affected by enterolithiasis to that in horses affected by other types of large intestinal obstruction. Two hundred and ninety-six horses were included in the study sample. Horses that had surgery for the removal of one or more enteroliths were included in the study as cases. Patients that had surgery for large intestinal simple obstructions other than enterolithiasis (large colon displacement, non-strangulating large colon torsion, and large and small colon impactions) were selected to match case horses for age, sex, and breed and included as controls. A total of 101/148 horses with enteroliths (68%) had gastric ulcers diagnosed during hospitalization, compared with 46/148 of matched controls (31%). There was a significant association between enterolithiasis and gastric ulceration (odds ratio 4.76, p &lt; 0.0001), and a greater prevalence in Thoroughbreds as compared with other breeds (odds ratio 22.6, p &lt; 0.0001). We concluded that enterolithiasis is significantly associated with gastric ulceration (p &lt; 0.0001). The association is stronger in Thoroughbreds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of PC on canine sperm quality after 72 h of storage at 4 &#176;C. The collected ejaculates were separated into four equal aliquots and treated with various concentrations of PC (0, 10, 30, and 50 &#956;g/mL) in Tris-citric-fructose-egg yolk (TCFE) extender and stored at 4 &#176;C for 72 h. The findings revealed that 30 &#956;g/mL PC was the optimum concentration for significantly improving sperm motility (p &lt; 0.05). Sperm samples treated with 30 &#956;g/mL PC had substantially greater plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential than the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, T-AOC and the expression levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) genes were significantly higher in sperm treated with 30 &#956;g/mL PC than those in control (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, this study discovered that adding PC to the TCFE extender enhanced sperm quality and that 30 &#956;g/mL PC was the optimal concentration for canine sperm when stored at 4 &#176;C.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is a lack of reports on the effects of multimodal analgesic approaches in mice. In this study, under the hypothesis that a multimodal analgesic protocol using buprenorphine with meloxicam has analgesic effects, we evaluated the effects of a multimodal analgesic protocol using buprenorphine with meloxicam on the well-being of mice during analgesic administration by changing the dosage of meloxicam. A total of 42 Slc:ICR male mice were categorized into nonsurgical and surgical groups (7 mice per group) and treated with an anesthetic (isoflurane) and analgesics (buprenorphine &#177; meloxicam). Analgesics were administered for 48 h after treatment. Buprenorphine (subcutaneous; 0.1 mg/kg/8 h) and meloxicam (subcutaneous; 0, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg/24 h) were administered twice. Body weight, food intake, nest consolidation score, and latency to burrow were evaluated. A significant decrease in food intake was observed 24 h after treatment, while a significant increase was observed 48 h post-treatment in all groups. Body weight showed a decreasing trend but was not significantly reduced. Furthermore, stomach, duodenum, and jejunum tissues showed no morphological abnormalities. Significant differences in burrow diving scores and the latency to burrow were observed between some groups, but these were not regarded as a consequence of the surgery and/or the meloxicam dose. When buprenorphine and meloxicam were combined, administering up to 5 mg/kg/day of meloxicam for 48 h to male mice after abdominal surgery had no significant negative effects on any tested parameters. In conclusion, a multimodal analgesic protocol of buprenorphine with meloxicam is among the options for increasing well-being in mice following abdominal surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study retrospectively analysed data collected from slaughtering registers and travel journals in a large Italian abattoir. We focused on pig transports coming from abroad and arriving at the slaughter plant after long journeys (a total of 59,982 pigs over 370 journeys). We explored the relationship between mortality and the following variables: country of origin, journey duration, astronomical season, stocking density on the truck, number of stops, and prolonged stops during the journey (lasting more than 60 min, likely due to traffic jams or truck problems). Overall, the low mortality rate observed (0.09%) was in line with European estimates. The factors with a significant or tendential effect on mortality during transport were the astronomical season (p = 0.0472, with higher mortality in spring) and the presence of prolonged stops during the journey (p = 0.069, tendential effect). Journey duration, stocking density, country of origin, and the number of stops were not statistically significant. In conclusion, based on this case study, using transport mortality combined with data collected during the common routine activity by the Public Veterinary Services in slaughterhouses could be a simple screening method for identifying problematic journeys or transport conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Canine adenoviruses with two serotypes host mammals and are members of the mastadenovirus family. Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) cause infectious canine hepatitis and infectious bronchial disease, respectively. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of CAdV-1 and 2 in wild Nyctereutes procyonoides in Korea in 2017-2020 from 414 tissue samples, including the liver, kidney, lung, and intestine, collected from 105 raccoon dog carcasses. Only CAdV-2 was detected in two raccoon dogs, whereas CAdV-1 was not detected. Tissue samples from raccoon dogs were screened for CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 using conventional PCR. Adenovirus was successfully isolated from PCR positive samples using the Vero cell line, and the full-length gene sequence of the isolated viruses was obtained through 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The major genes of the isolated CAdV-2/18Ra54 and CAdV-2/18Ra-65 strains showed the closest relationship with that of the CAdV-2 Toronto A26/61 strain isolated from Canada in 1976. There is no large mutation between CAdV-2, which is prevalent worldwide, and CAdV-2, which is prevalent in wild animals in Korea. In addition, it is still spreading and causing infections. The Toronto A26/61 strain, which showed the most similarity to CAdV-2/18Ra-54, was likely transmitted to wild animals through vaccinated companion animals, suggesting that further research is needed on safety measures surrounding animal vaccination. This study provides information on the genetic characteristics and prevalence of canine adenovirus in domestic wild animals and provides a better understanding of canine adenovirus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Enterococcus is a Gram-positive bacterium that frequently causes opportunistic ear infections. Here, we determined the distribution of Enterococcus in canine otitis externa via time-of-flight mass spectrometry and biochemical tests and evaluated their resistance patterns to 10 commonly used antibiotics. Among the 197 Enterococcus isolates, E. faecalis (48.7%; 96/197) was the most common, followed by E. faecium (21.3%; 42/197), E. casseliflavus (11.7%; 23/197), E. hirae (10.7%; 21/197), E. avium (3.6%; 7/197), E. gallinarum (2.5%; 5/197), E. canintestini (1.0%; 2/197), and E. durans (0.5%; 1/197). All isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Enterococcus faecalis strains were highly resistant to erythromycin (45.8%) and rifampin (34.3%) but were generally susceptible to penicillin class antibiotics. In contrast, E. faecium isolates were highly resistant to penicillin class antibiotics (ampicillin, 61.9%; penicillin, 71.4%). Most importantly, E. faecium demonstrated high resistance to most of the antibiotics used in this study. Multidrug resistance was found in 28.4% of the isolates (56/197). This study shows prevalence and antibiotics resistance profiles of Enterococcus species in canine chronic otitis externa. The results can contribute to establish therapeutic strategies of Enterococcus infections and be used as a comparable index of antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At the first visit (day 0), although clinical signs improved due to the use of medication from the primary hospital, transthoracic radiography and echocardiography revealed left heart enlargement and left ventricular dysfunction. A clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was made and oral administration of pimobendan, temocapril, and taurine was initiated. However, on day 10, the respiratory status worsened and furosemide was prescribed. On day 54, no significant improvement in heart size was observed. Additionally, the diet that this patient received met the recommendation for diet-related DCM by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the patient's diet was changed from a grain-free diet to a grain-containing diet. On day 1191, the patient's respiratory status was stable and no clinical signs were observed. Transthoracic radiography and echocardiography revealed an improvement in left heart size. Additionally, improvements in the left and right ventricular myocardial strains were observed after changing the diet. We suggest that it may be necessary to suspect a dietary association with dilated cardiomyopathy, and a good prognosis might be expected by dietary modification, even in small-breed dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On physical examination, the mass was palpable in the right humeral region, and the cat exhibited pain on palpation. Radiography revealed an expansile osteolytic lesion at the proximal end of the right humerus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an expansile bony mass on the proximal end of the right humerus and a mild periosteal reaction around the acromion of the scapula. Amputation of the right forelimb, including the scapula and removal of the axillary lymph node, were strongly recommended to the owner, but were declined. Four months after the initial presentation, the cat presented with a dramatically swollen right forelimb and progressive lameness. CT was performed again. In addition to osteolytic changes in the mass, vascular development had occurred at the cranioproximal region. The right forelimb, including the scapula and ipsilateral lymph nodes, was removed. The cat died during the postoperative recovery period. Based on clinical, diagnostic imaging, and histological findings, the final diagnosis was aneurysmal bone cyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an aneurysmal bone cyst in the humerus of a cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, in some species, the relationship between the blood values of both enzymes measured by the two methods remains unclear. Hence, values measured by these two methods cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, this relationship was examined in ICR mice and Wistar/ST rats. The LD and ALP values obtained by both methods were plotted on scatter graphs, and regression equations were obtained. To compare the JSCC (x) and IFCC (y) methods, regression equations were generated for LD values in non-hemolytic samples as follows: y = 0.954x - 4.008 for ICR mice and y = 0.963x - 6.324 for Wistar/ST rats. The conversion factors from the JSCC to the IFCC methods were 0.954 (mice) and 0.963 (rats). The conversion coefficients from the IFCC to the JSCC methods were 1.048 (mice) and 1.088 (rats). For ALP values in fasted mouse and rat samples, the regression equations were y = 0.336x - 2.247 and y = 0.314x - 17.626, respectively. The conversion factors from the JSCC to the IFCC methods were 0.336 (mice) and 0.314 (rats). The conversion coefficients from the IFCC to the JSCC methods were 2.978 (mice) and 3.188 (rats). These conversion factors can be used for the mutual conversion of both measured values during the transition period from the JSCC to the IFCC method. However, it should be noted that the conversion coefficients for both LD and ALP were affected by isozyme composition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In eastern Uruguay there are still bees resistant to mites that survive without acaricides. In order to determine if the differential resistance to V. destructor was maintained in other environments, a reciprocal transplant experiment was performed between the mite-resistant bee colonies and the mite-susceptible bee colonies from the east and the west of the country, respectively, infesting bees with local mites. In both regions, the mite-resistant colonies expressed a higher hygienic behavior and presented a higher phoretic mites/reproductive mites and mites in drone cells/mites in worker cells ratio than the mite-susceptible colonies. All the mite-susceptible colonies died during fall-winter, while a considerable number of mite-resistant colonies survived until spring, especially in the east of the country. This study shows that the bees in the east of the country maintain in good measure the resistance to V. destructor in other regions and leaves open the possibility that the mites of the two populations have biases in the reproductive behavior.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our objective was to evaluate concentrations of hormones in mule (n = 6) and equine foals (n = 6). Blood was collected at T0, 1, 6 and 12 h after birth. Hormone concentrations were evaluated using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Effects of time, group and interactions and regression analysis were evaluated (p &lt; 0.05). There was a cubic and quadratic decline in mule and equine foals, respectively, for 3&#946;,20&#945;-dihydroxy-DHP. Mule foals were born with lower circulating 3&#946;,20&#945;-dihydroxy-DHP concentrations, which might be related to progestogen concentrations in mares with a hybrid placenta. Corticosterone and cortisol concentrations remained unchanged for the first hour post-foaling then declined in mule and equine foals (p &lt; 0.0001). Dehydroepiandrosterone was the main androgen present. There was a decrease in dihydrotestosterone at 12 h (p = 0.002). Differences in the temporal patterns of secretion within each steroid class, pregnanes, corticoids, and androgens, suggest they were derived from different tissue sources, presumptively the placenta, adrenals and gonads of the fetus/neonate, respectively. Mule and horse foals were born without evidence of testosterone secretion. For the first time, steroid hormone levels were measured in neonatal mules, and this will provide insight into neonatal physiology that differs from equine and allow us to gain an understanding of mules that have rarely been studied. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of hybrid pregnancies in the steroid endocrinology of neonates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on the previous RNA-seq results of the duodenum from E. coli F18-resistant and -susceptible Meishan piglets, CXCL11, an important functional gene, was preliminarily screened. In this investigation, in order to further examine the expression regulation mechanism of E. coli F18 in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) against E. coli F18 infection, CXCL11 gene expression on IPEC-J2 cells infected by E. coli F18 was detected, which was significantly downregulated (p &lt; 0.01). Secondly, the overexpression on the IPEC-J2 cell line was successfully structured, and a relative quantification method of the PILIN, bacteria enumeration, and immunofluorescence assay indicated that the CXCL11 overexpression significantly reduced the ability of E. coli F18 to interact with IPEC-J2 in vitro. The promoter region of the CXCL11 gene was predicted to contain a CpG island (&#8722;619 ~ &#8722;380 bp) of which 13 CpG sites in the sequencing region were methylated to varying degrees, and the methylation level of one CPG site (mC-7) positively linked negatively with the expression of the CXCL11 gene (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, a dual luciferase assay detected the mutation of the mC-7 site that significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of the CXCL11 gene promoter (p &lt; 0.01). Transcription factor prediction and expression verification indicated that mC-7 is located in the OSR1-binding domain, and that its expression level is related to E. coli F18 susceptibility. We speculated that methylation modification of the mC-7 site of the CpG island in the promoter region of the CXCL11 gene might inhibit the binding of transcription factor OSR1 with the mC-7 site, and then affect its expression level to regulate the susceptibility to E. coli F18.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An eight-year retrospective study of collected ultrasound data was carried out in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil from September 2012 to July 2020. A total of 3463 animals from 16 sheep flocks and 10 dairy goat flocks, raised under extensive and intensive management systems, respectively, were used in the study. All animals were submitted to an ultrasound examination of their reproductive tract. Data were analyzed using Fisher&#8217;s exact test (p &lt; 0.05), to compare disorder frequencies within and between species. Ewes (4.14%) had fewer reproductive disorders than does (8.98%), while rams (43.63%) and bucks (56.25%) presented no significant differences. Hydrometra was the most frequent finding in does, represented by 50.98% of cases; while, in ewes, recent fetal loss (22.85%) and cystic endometrial hyperplasia (20.00%) were the most frequent. In bucks, the findings showed no clear differences; while, for rams, the most frequent finding was testicular microlithiasis (75.00%). Ultrasonography offers clinically useful information about the reproductive tract via the images it provides; knowledge of which makes it possible to improve the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of genital pathologies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We investigated the effect of direct contact with an ultrasonic bone curette on the dura and the protective effect of covering the dura with a cotton pattie using an excised porcine spinal cord. The ultrasonic bone curette was pressed against the porcine spinal cord with constant force and activated for 1 s, with or without covering the dura with a cotton pattie. The dural surface and cross-section were observed using electron and light microscopy. When the ultrasonic bone curette was applied directly against the dura, most specimens showed non-perforating dural injuries. However, none of the specimens showed dural perforation. Histological changes were also observed. The use of a cotton pattie reduced the occurrence of these changes, although it did not prevent them when ultrasonic vibration was applied with a large force. We considered ultrasonic bone curettes to have a low risk of dural perforation and, thus, to be a safe surgical device as long as they did not accidentally make strong contact with the dura.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For the equine dental pulp, there are no descriptions which allow for a comparative analysis with regard to functional requirements in terms of lifelong secondary dentin production to compensate for occlusal wear. For histomorphological and immunohistological investigations, ten incisors and ten check teeth were used from seven adult horses and five foals. In the periphery of the equine dental pulp, a constant predentin and odontoblastic cell layer was present, followed by densely packed fibroblastic cells, capillary networks, and a high concentration of nerve fibers, suggesting a subodontoblastic supportive zone. Whilst the size of the equine dental pulp decreased with age, the numbers of blood vessels, nerve fibers, and fibroblastic cells increased with age. Histological analysis of the equine dental pulp did not show a cell-free and cell-rich zone as described in the brachydont crown pulp. The equine dental pulp remained in a juvenile status even in aged horses, with morphological features indicating a high capacity for dentine production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36356080</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Genomic and Genetic Evolution Analysis of Rabbit Astrovirus.</Title>	<Abstract>Rabbit astrovirus (RAstV) is a pathogen that causes diarrhea in rabbits, with high infection rate at various stages, which can often cause secondary or mixed infections with other pathogens, bringing great economic losses to the rabbit industry. In this study, 10 samples were collected from cases of rabbits with diarrhea on a rabbit meat farm in the Shandong area of China. The positive sample for astrovirus detected by RT-PCR was inoculated into an RK 13 cell line. A rabbit astrovirus strain named Z317 was successfully isolated, which produced an obvious cytopathic effect 48 h post-inoculation in the RK 13 cell line. The genome structure of this isolate was studied by high-throughput sequencing, showing that the Z317 strain had the highest similarity with the American strain TN/2208/2010, with 92.43% nucleotide homology, belonging to group MRAstV-23. The basic properties of the Z317 capsid (Cap) protein were analyzed, and 10 liner B cell epitopes were screened with the online biosoft Bepipred 2.0 and SVMTriP, including 445-464, 186-205, 655-674, 88-107, 792-811, 45-64, and 257-276 amino acids. This is the first contribution concerning RAstV genomes in China; more studies are needed to understand the diversity and impact of RAstV on rabbit health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The combination of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) and intercostal blocks can be used to desensitize the entire abdominal wall in dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TAP and intercostal blocks in bitches undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy. Twenty client-owned bitches were enrolled in this double-blinded randomized controlled trial. After premedication with dexmedetomidine, methadone and ketamine, the animals were randomized into two groups. Dogs in the TAP group received intercostal blocks from T8 to T10 and a TAP block with ropivacaine. Dogs in the FEN group received a fentanyl bolus and a constant rate infusion for the entire duration of the procedure. Intra-operative cardiovascular stability, post-operative pain scores, rescue opioid requirement, dysphoria during recovery, time to attain sternal recumbency and interest in food at 6 h post-extubation were compared. Bitches in the TAP group received a statistically significant lower amount of rescue fentanyl intra-operatively and methadone post-operatively. Pain scores were lower in the TAP group until 6 h post-extubation. No difference was found for dysphoric recoveries, time to attain sternal recumbency and appetite at 6 h post-extubation. No adverse event was recorded for any of the dogs. The combination of TAP and intercostal blocks can be part of an effective multi-modal analgesic strategy in bitches undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study was conducted by the Division of Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, and concentrated on ultrasonographic contribution to diagnostics and treatment of the disease. Among many standard cases of rhodococcal pneumonia, some rare ones occurred. The aforementioned issues include the potential contribution of rhodococcal infection to a grave outcome in a prematurely born filly, lost as a yearling, so-called "extrapulmonary disorders" (EPD), a hypothesis of inherited immunodeficiency with grave outcome in a breeding dam line from one stud, and macrolide-induced anhidrosis. The main benefit of this report would be to supplement the general picture of clinical rhodococcosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a re-emerging viral animal disease. This study investigates the quantitative association between climate change and the potential spread of ASFV to a global extent. ASFV in wild boar outbreak locations recorded from 1 January 2019 to 29 July 2022 were sampled and investigated using the ecological distribution tool, the Maxent model, with WorldClim bioclimatic data as the predictor variables. The future impacts of climate change on ASFV distribution based on the model were scoped with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) scenarios of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) bioclimatic data for 2050 and 2070. The results show that precipitation of the driest month (Bio14) was the highest contributor, and annual mean temperature (Bio1) was obtained as the highest permutation importance variable on the spread of ASFV. Based on the analyzed scenarios, we found that the future climate is favourable for ASFV disease; only quantitative ratios are different and directly associated with climate change. The current study could be a reference material for wildlife health management, climate change issues, and World Health Organization sustainability goal 13: climate action.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36356084</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Preliminary Studies on the Intrahepatic Anatomy of the Venous Vasculature in Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>Hepatic surgeries are often performed in cats to obtain a disease diagnosis, for the removal of masses, or for the treatment of shunts. Whereas the vascular anatomy of the liver has been studied in dogs, such evidence is lacking in cats. The current study used corrosion casts of portal and hepatic veins and computed tomography (CT) analysis of the casts to identify and describe the intrahepatic anatomy in healthy cat livers (n = 7). The results showed that feline livers had a consistent intrahepatic portal and venous anatomy, with only minor disparities in the numbers of secondary and tertiary branches. The feline portal vein consistently divided into two major branches and not three, as previously described in the literature for cats. The finding of a portal vein originating from the right medial lobe branch leading to the quadrate lobe in 4/7 specimens is a novelty of the feline anatomy that was not previously described in dogs. Partial to complete fusion of the caudate process of the caudate and the right lateral lobe, with a lack of clear venous separation between the lobes, was present in two specimens. These findings allowed a detailed description of the most common intrahepatic venous patterns in cats. Further anatomical studies should be encouraged to confirm the present findings and to investigate the utility of this information in surgical settings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This disease is endemic in the Mediterranean area, where the main reservoir is the dog. Several studies indicate a possible susceptibility to L. infantum infection with clinical signs in some canine breeds. One of them is the boxer breed, which shows a high prevalence of disease. In this study, immunological and genomic characterization of serum samples from boxer dogs living in the Mediterranean area were evaluated to analyze the immune response and the possible genetic explanation for this susceptibility. Serum levels of cytokines IFN-&#947;, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 were determined by ELISA commercial tests, while the genotyping study was performed using the CanineHD DNA Analysis BeadChip. The results show relevant differences in the serum levels of cytokines compared to published data on other canine breeds, as well as sequence changes that could explain the high susceptibility of the boxer breed to the disease. Concretely, polymorphic variants in the CIITA, HSF2BP, LTBP1, MITF, NOXA1, PKIB, RAB38, RASEF, TLE1, and TLR4 genes were found, which could explain the susceptibility of this breed to L. infantum infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The low efficiency of in vitro-produced embryos to derive embryonic stem cells has made achieving this goal a challenge. The fallopian tube plays an important role in the development of embryos. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by oviductal epithelial cells play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of embryo development. We used artificially isolated oviductal epithelial cells and EVs. In this study, oviductal epithelial cell (OEC) EVs were isolated and characterized through transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticles tracking analysis, western blotting and proteomics. We found that embryo development and blastocyst formation rate was significantly increased (14.3% &#177; 0.6% vs. 6.0% &#177; 0.6%) after OEC EVs treatment. According to our data, the inner cell mass (ICM)/trophectoderm (TE) ratio of the embryonic cell number increased significantly after OEC EVs treatment (43.7% &#177; 2.3% vs. 28.4% &#177; 2.1%). Meanwhile, the attachment ability of embryos treated with OEV EVs was significantly improved (43.5% &#177; 2.1% vs. 29.2% &#177; 2.5%, respectively). Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we found that the expression of reprogramming genes (POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and c-Myc) and implantation-related genes (VIM, KRT8, TEAD4 and CDX2) significantly increased in OEC EV-treated embryos. We report that OEC EV treatment can improve the development and implantation abilities of embryos.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy exerts an antimicrobial effect as demonstrated in multiple acute bacterial infection models. This effect can be enhanced by pre-conditioning the MSC with Toll or Nod-like receptor stimulation, termed activated cellular therapy (ACT). The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of MSC with emphasis on enhanced effects through receptor agonism, and data supporting use of ACT in treatment of bacterial infections in veterinary species including dogs, cats, and horses with implications for further treatment applications. This review will advance the field's understanding of the use of activated antimicrobial cellular therapy to treat infection, including mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The EOPM was included at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% dry matter (DM) to formulate into four dietary treatments and assigned to goats with an average age of 12 months and an initial body weight of 23 &#177; 0.5 kg in a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design. The PROC MIXED procedure was used to analyze all data, and the orthogonal polynomial was tested for EOPM levels using the SAS program. The DM intake, nitrogen, and metabolizable energy linearly (p &lt; 0.05) increased when there was increased EOPM inclusion. Increasing EOPM inclusions resulted in (p &lt; 0.05) a linear increase in fiber digestibility but did not affect DM, crude protein, or ether extract. Total volatile fatty acids increased (p &lt; 0.05) linearly with increasing EOPM inclusions. The EOPM inclusions did not alter the bacteria, fungi, and protozoal populations. Blood parameters were not affected by the inclusions of EOPM except globulin, triglyceride, and MCV concentration. This study revealed that EOPM could be included in up to 20% DM in TMR for goats with no negative impact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, a total of 750 fertilized eggs of Ross 308 were exposed to EMWs for 1050 min during the incubation period. On the 17th day of incubation, the eggs were divided into three groups and solutions were injected into the amnion sac of embryos. The chicks were housed separately in accordance with in ovo treatments for 5 wk after hatching. An in ovo vitamin C injection resulted in a lower hatching weight. The post-hatch mortality or production efficiency factor of birds in the in ovo vitamin C injection group and the intact egg group were comparable, and were better than that of the other negative control group. In ovo vitamin C injection in eggs subjected to EMWs significantly increased their body weight gain, carcass weight, abdominal fat weight, and AST levels, but reduced spleen weight and PON-1 levels. In conclusion, an in ovo vitamin C injection in eggs subject to mobile phone EMWs improved the post-hatch performance of chicks, but low PON and high AST activities indicate an increase in oxidative damage among broiler chicks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Each group (control, TPC, NaCl) consisted of three batches of approximately 260 fattening pigs each. Performance, water intake, markers for bone resorption (CTX) and bone formation (osteocalcin) and urinalysis from samples taken at the farm and in the slaughterhouse were investigated. Performance parameters, feed and water intake, CTX and osteocalcin were not significantly different between the groups (p &gt; 0.05). The main crystals found were struvite, COD, calcite and amorphous crystals. The prevalence of COD crystals was lower in samples from the slaughterhouse in each group. Microscopic and biochemical examination of urine showed large differences between samples from the farm and the slaughterhouse. In conclusion, there were no beneficial effects of feed supplementation with TPC or NaCl on the prevalence of COD crystals but TPC has a clear promoting influence on the development of alkaline calcite crystals. Urinalysis from samples taken at the slaughterhouse does not fully reflect the situation on the farm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the mechanisms of LPS in geese muscle development have not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of LPS on proliferation and differentiation of goose embryonic myoblasts. Embelin and belnacasan combined with LPS were used to explore these effects. Our results demonstrated that LPS significantly induced inflammatory cytokine production in both proliferation and differentiation stages. LPS and embelin treatment significantly improved the proliferation ability (p &lt; 0.05), while LPS reduced the differentiation ability of goose embryonic myoblasts. By adding embelin, the differentiation ability of myoblasts was enhanced, while by adding belnacasan, LPS treatment led to a lower differentiation ability. Combined with the correlation of the expression levels of myogenic, cell cycle, and inflammatory-related genes and proteins, it is speculated that one of the reason for the decrease of differentiation ability of goose embryo myoblasts induced by LPS is the increase of the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors. Moreover, LPS, embelin and belnacasan, and LPS treatments could significantly increase the apoptosis rate of goose embryonic myoblasts. Taken together, these findings suggest that LPS promotes the proliferation and differentiation of goose embryonic myoblasts by promoting cytokine expression and appropriate apoptosis processes. These findings lay a foundation for the study of the mechanisms of LPS in goose muscle development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They were subjected to two protocols for synchronization of ovulation: (i) Ovsynch (OV) and (ii) progesterone based (P4) treatment. After calving, the animals underwent a series of four cycles of re-synchronization protocols. The season did not affect pregnancy rates when the results of the two treatments were pooled together with regard to the first synchronization protocol, followed by AI. Pregnancy rates were similar during the low breeding season (50.3% vs. 57.4% in OV and P4, respectively), but different during the high breeding season (50.4% vs. 67.7% in OV and P4, respectively; p = 0.000). Logistic regression confirmed a significant effect of treatment and season interaction on pregnancy (p = 0.003). Following re-synchronization, a treatment by season interaction was detected during the low breeding season (odds ratio = 2.233), in favor of P4. Finally, a survival analysis showed a better response of animals subjected to P4 treatment from the second AI onward. In conclusion, the pooled data of pregnancy rates from both treatments between seasons are not different following AIs. Better results, though, were obtained from the implementation of P4 treatment, and are recorded in a season-fashioned mode when the comparison is made following first or cumulative AIs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 factorial arrangement with a randomized complete block design was employed. The first factor: level of L. casei TH14 [L; 0 and 105 cfu/kg fresh matter (FM)], the second factor: level of molasses (M; 0 and 4% DM), the third factor: level of urea (U; 0 and 4% DM), and the number of days of fermentation (7, 14, and 21 days) were evaluated using a statistical block. There were interactions among CSP fermented with different additives on DM content (p &lt; 0.05). The control group (CON) and CSP fermented with L, L&#215;M, and L&#215;U had lower DM contents than U, U&#215;M, and L&#215;U&#215;M. The crude protein of CSP was increased by interaction of L&#215;U and U&#215;M additives (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Interaction effects between L and U and NDF content were detected (p &lt; 0.05). The L&#215;U combination resulted in a significantly lower NDF than the other groups. The interaction between L&#215;U&#215;M had no effect on the change in the CSP fermentation process (p &gt; 0.05). The combination of U&#215;M caused a poorer pH than other groups (p &lt; 0.01). The ammonia-N content was higher than others, when CSP was fermented with L&#215;U (p &lt; 0.01) or U&#215;M (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The lactic acid levels in fermented CSP were higher (p &lt; 0.01) than in other groups through the L. casei. The interaction between L&#215;U&#215;M had an influence on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (p &lt; 0.01) and aerobic bacteria (p &lt; 0.01). The highest LAB population (p &lt; 0.01) at 106 cfu/g FM was found in CSP fermented with L. casei and molasses. In conclusion, the current study shows that CSP treated with L&#215;U&#215;M resulted in good preservation by recovering DM, a low number of aerobic bacteria, and greater LAB than other treatments, with the exception of the L&#215;U&#215;M addition. A 21-day fermentation period is advised because it produces products with greater levels of crude protein, lactic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

FIV diagnosis using point-of-care (PoC) kits to detect FIV antibodies in Australia is complicated by the commercial availability of an inactivated whole-FIV vaccine. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the RapidSTATUS&#8482; FIV antibody test kit in FIV-vaccinated and FIV-unvaccinated cats in Australia. Plasma from pet cats of known FIV vaccination and FIV infection statuses (n = 361), comprised of 57 FIV-uninfected cats annually vaccinated against FIV, 10 FIV-uninfected cats with lapsed FIV vaccination histories, 259 FIV-unvaccinated/FIV-uninfected cats, and 35 FIV-infected cats, was tested. RapidSTATUS&#8482; FIV testing had sensitivity of 97.1% (34/35) and specificity of 100% (326/326), with an overall accuracy of 99.7% (360/361). Additional testing was undertaken using plasma from FIV-uninfected cats recently administered a primary FIV vaccination course (n = 12) or an annual booster FIV vaccination (n = 10). RapidSTATUS&#8482; FIV was 98.8% (81/82) accurate and 100% (32/32) accurate in cats recently administered primary or annual FIV vaccinations, respectively. The high level of accuracy of RapidSTATUS&#8482; FIV (98.8-100%) therefore establishes this PoC kit as a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) test. RapidSTATUS&#8482; FIV is recommended to aid animal shelters, veterinarians, and researchers in Australia to accurately determine FIV infection status, irrespective of FIV vaccination history.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36356096</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Sound Localization Ability in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The minimum audible angle (MAA), defined as the smallest detectable difference between the azimuths of two identical sources of sound, is a standard measure of spatial auditory acuity in animals. Few studies have explored the MAA of dogs, using methods that do not allow potential improvement throughout the assessment, and with a very small number of dog(s) assessed. To overcome these limits, we adopted a staircase method on 10 dogs, using a two-forced choice procedure with two sound sources, testing angles of separation from 60&#176; to 1&#176;. The staircase method permits the level of difficulty for each dog to be continuously adapted and allows for the observation of improvement over time. The dogs' average MAA was 7.6&#176;, although with a large interindividual variability, ranging from 1.3&#176; to 13.2&#176;. A global improvement was observed across the procedure, substantiated by a gradual lowering of the MAA and of choice latency across sessions. The results indicate that the staircase method is feasible and reliable in the assessment of auditory spatial localization in dogs, highlighting the importance of using an appropriate method in a sensory discrimination task, so as to allow improvement over time. The results also reveal that the MAA of dogs is more variable than previously reported, potentially reaching values lower than 2&#176;. Although no clear patterns of association emerged between MAA and dogs' characteristics such as ear shape, head shape or age, the results suggest the value of conducting larger-scale studies to determine whether these or other factors influence sound localization abilities in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hydrogen-rich water possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions and exerts inhibitory effects on various inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated whether oral hydrogen-rich water could prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic intestinal inflammation. An experimental model was established by feeding hydrogen-rich water, followed by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (200 &#956;g/kg) in the tail vein of rats after seven months. ELISA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and other methods were used to detect related cytokines, proteins related to the NF-&#954;B and Nrf-2 signaling pathways, and tight-junction proteins to study the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of hydrogen-rich water. The obtained results show that hydrogen-rich water significantly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and structural proteins; activated the Nrf-2 signaling pathway; downregulated the expression of inflammatory factors cyclooxygenase-2, myeloperoxidase, and ROS; and decreased the activation of the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. These results suggest that hydrogen-rich water could protect against chronic intestinal inflammation in rats caused by lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway by regulating the Nrf-2 signaling pathway.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of drinking water with high concentrations of TDS from sulfate salts on nursery pigs. Weaned pigs sorted to equalize gender were placed in 44 pens with 26 pigs per pen. One of four water treatments was randomly assigned to each pen: (1) combination of CaSO4, MgSO4, and NaSO4; (2) CaSO4; (3) MgSO4; (4) NaSO4. Access to water and feed (nursery diets fed in four phases) was unrestricted throughout. The weights of pens were measured, feed remaining on weigh days was calculated, and pen water meters were read on d 0, 7, 21, 35, and 42. Water treatment did not affect (p &gt; 0.07) average daily gain, average daily feed intake, or gut integrity of pigs. Water disappearance tended to be greater (p = 0.10) in pens receiving the CaSO4 water compared to the combination treatment from d 21 to 35. The TDS concentrations from sulfate salts used in this experiment did not impact the growth performance or feed or water disappearance of newly weaned nursery pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, systemic analgesia does not fully prevent perioperative visceral and somatic pain triggered by the surgical stimulus.</Abstract><Abstract>To compare the analgesic effects and quality of recovery of systemic analgesia with those of a sacrococcygeal epidural injection of lidocaine and morphine in cats undergoing elective OHE. Methods: Twenty domestic female cats were premedicated with dexmedetomidine (0.01 mg kg[-1] IM) and alfaxalone (1.5 mg kg[-1] IM) and randomly assigned to one of two analgesic protocols: methadone (0.2 mg kg[-1] IM) in the control group CTR (n = 10) and methadone (0.1 mg kg[-1] IM) + epidural (lidocaine 2% (0.3 mL kg[-1]) + morphine 1% (0.1 mg kg[-1]) diluted with NaCl 0.9% to a total volume of 1.5 mL in the SCC-E group (n = 10). General anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone (1 mg kg[-1] IV) and maintained with sevoflurane in 100% oxygen. Non-invasive blood arterial pressure and cardiorespiratory variables were recorded. The quality of recovery was assessed using a simple descriptive scale. Before surgery and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h post-op pain was assessed using the UNESP-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale (MCPS) and mechanical nociception thresholds (MNT). The repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare groups over time. Comparison between groups was performed using independent samples t-test if the assumption of normality was verified, or the Mann-Whitney test. The chi-square test of independence and exact Fisher's test were used to compare groups according to recovery quality.</Abstract><Abstract>Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure increased significantly from baseline values in the CTR group and did not change in the SCC-E group. In the CTR group, MNT and UNESP-Botucatu-MCPS scores increased significantly from baseline for all assessment points and the first 3 h, respectively, whereas this did not occur in the SCC-E group.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on our results, the SCC-E administration of lidocaine 2% with morphine 1% is a reasonable option to provide perioperative analgesia in cats submitted to OHE, compared to a systemic protocol alone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main objective of this study was to determine whether elevated somatic cell counts (SCC) in cows prior to drying off are related to the incidence of other periparturient diseases. Additionally, we determined whether milk composition and milk yield are affected by a high SCC prior to drying off. Somatic cell counts of milk samples were determined prior to dry off (n = 140) and were used to classify cows in the study as high (&gt;200,000 cells/mL) or low (&lt;200,000 cells/mL) SCC. The composition of milk was analyzed before drying off and at 1 and 2 weeks after calving. The results showed that an elevated SCC before drying off was related to the incidence of ketosis. Cows with a high SCC at drying off also showed an increased likelihood of retained placenta, metritis, and lameness postpartum; however, it was not statistically significant. Milk lactose was lower in cows with high SCC, whereas protein content was lower after parturition. Milk production was lower for cows with pre-drying elevated SCC, particularly for cows with retained placenta, ketosis, and mastitis. In conclusion, cows with pre-drying elevated SCC were more likely to develop disease after parturition and produce less milk and with lower lactose and protein content.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Seventy-two male Wistar rats were divided into two equal groups, experimental and control. Each group consisted of three equal subgroups. The animals were sacrificed 30, 60, and 90 days after the start of the experiment. Blood samples were collected from the eye, and the osteoprotegerin (OPG), Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), and Macrophage Colony-Stimulating factor (MCSF)concentrations were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. A histological analysis was performed on the mandibular condyles. The blood serum values of OPG, RANKL, and MCSF did not exhibit any statistically significant difference between groups or subgroups. However, significant histological changes became evident after a histomorphometric condylar examination was performed. The Bone Surface/Total Surface ratio appeared reduced in the anterior and posterior regions of the condyle. In addition, the Posterior Condylar Cartilage Thickness was measured and determined to be significantly diminished. The present intervention that employed orthodontic/orthopedic devices did not prove to have any significant effect on the circulating proteins under study. Posterior displacement of the mandible may culminate only in local histological alterations in condylar cartilage thickness and its osseous microarchitecture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36356103</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Oral Electrolyte and Water Supplementation in Horses.</Title>	<Abstract>Horses that sweat for prolonged periods lose considerable amounts of water and electrolytes. Maintenance of hydration and prevention of dehydration requires that water and electrolytes are replaced. Dehydration is common in equine disciplines and can be avoided, thus promoting equine wellness, improved performance and enhanced horse and rider safety. Significant dehydration occurs through exercise or transport lasting one hour or more. Oral electrolyte supplementation is an effective strategy to replace water and electrolytes lost through sweating. The stomach and small intestine serve as a reservoir for uptake of water and electrolytes consumed 1 to 2 h prior to exercise and transport. The small intestine is the primary site of very rapid absorption of ions and water. Water and ions absorbed in the small intestine are taken up by muscles, and also transported via the blood to the skin where they serve to replace or augment the losses of water and ions in the body. Effective electrolyte supplements are designed to replace the proportions of ions lost through sweating; failure to do so can result in electrolyte imbalance. Adequate water must be consumed with electrolytes so as to maintain solution osmolality less than that of body fluids in order to promote gastric emptying and intestinal absorption. The electrolyte supplement should taste good, and horses should be trained to drink the solution voluntarily prior to and during transport, and prior to and after exercise.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there is no available information in the veterinary literature regarding serum bile acid concentrations in dogs with sepsis. We aimed to evaluate if resting serum bile acid concentrations differ between septic and non-septic dogs. This was a retrospective observational study, of medical records at a single referral center over a twelve-year period. Twenty-six client-owned dogs diagnosed with sepsis were identified. Twenty-one dogs presenting with a non-hepatobiliary systemic disease and twenty-nine dogs admitted for an elective orthopedic procedure, considered otherwise healthy, were selected as control groups. Resting serum bile acid concentrations were significantly higher in the septic compared to the non-septic groups (ill control and orthopedic control groups). However, when assessing bile acid concentrations between groups individually, no difference was identified between the septic and the orthopedic control group. These results should be interpreted cautiously.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Preliminary Results in Simple Carcinomas.</Title>	<Abstract>Neoplastic progression is influenced by the expression of tumour antigens that activate an anti-tumour immune response. Human medical studies show that this body defence is carried out in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) but also directly in the tumour through organized cellular aggregates that are called tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). However, their occurrence has different meanings in different tumour types. For example, the presence of TLSs in breast cancer is associated with the most aggressive subtypes. This paper aimed to study TLSs in canine mammary simple carcinomas. A morphological assessment of the inflammatory infiltrate was performed on H&amp;E sections of fifty cases. Immunohistochemistry was then carried out to typify the inflammatory cells in the tumour microenvironment. Results showed that, sometimes, inflammatory infiltrates were organized in follicles close to high-grade carcinomas, simulating a lymphoid organization, as in breast cancer. Therefore, we can assume that even in canine mammary tumours, TLSs exist and they are entities to consider due to their presence in the most aggressive histotypes or tumours with a high degree of malignancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Epidemiological outbreaks and technological development have contributed to this. Through the analysis of the number of publications from a citation database, we aimed to obtain an indicator of the scientific community's interest towards wildlife diseases over the years. Using Web of Science, bibliographic searches were performed by adding to the basic search string "Wildlife AND Disease" terms detailing topics such as aspect investigated, pathogen type, aetiologic group and species group. For each host species group, the 100 most frequent Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs) related to specific diseases in each decade were extracted. The scientific production regarding wildlife diseases has increased 3.7 times the relative proportion of publications on diseases during the last 50 years, focusing mainly on zoonotic or epizootic pathogens, and with a sharp growth in contemporary hot topics. Wildlife disease scenarios are complex and challenging to approach. Knowing the trends in the scientific interest in the past decades may pose a guide to direct future steps and actions in several fields, from public health to ecosystem management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The pathogenic mechanism of M. bovis infection is still unknown, which leads to the lack of timely diagnosis and treatment. In this study, embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells, infected with M. bovis were collected for gene profiling and detection of marker genes in the mTOR signaling pathway. The result showed that M. bovis infection significantly inhibits EBL growth in a dose-dependent manner. The transcription profiling data uncovered that M. bovis infection repressed a series of gene expressions in EBL cells, which are mainly related to metabolic process and immune response. Notably, many marker genes in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway showed down-regulation after M. bovis infection. Further evidence showed that M. bovis infection inhibits expression of mTOR signaling pathway marker genes in EBL cells, which are time dependent. To further understand the M. bovis-induced inhibitory effect of mTOR signaling pathway, this study employed FBS as a supplement for exogenous nutrients and found that addition of a high concentration of FBS can rescue M. bovis-induced cell damage. In addition, a high concentration of FBS can rescue down-regulated mTOR signaling, including increasing transcriptional expression and protein phosphorylation level of mTOR pathway marker genes. This study demonstrated that M. bovis infection leads to inhibition of the nutrient metabolic pathway mTOR in a time-dependent manner, which would be helpful to further understand M. bovis infection mechanism and develop a new efficient anti-mycoplasma strategy targeting mTOR signaling.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36423080</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Can Stray Cats Be Reservoirs of Antimicrobial Resistance?</Title>	<Abstract>The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem that requires a One Health approach. Despite several studies have reported the role of companion animals as reservoirs of AMR, limited information is available regarding the role of cats in the circulation of AMR. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic and genotypic profile of 75 Escherichia coli isolated from rectal swabs and fecal samples of 75 stray cats (living in solitary or in a colony) sampled in Palermo (Sicily, Italy), to determine whether these animals may participate in the spread of AMR. Susceptibility to 8 antibiotics was tested using Minimum Inhibitory Concentration assays, while the presence of the common antibiotic resistance genes blaTEM, blaCTX-M, tet(A), and tet(B) was investigated by PCR. From the 75 E. coli isolates analyzed, 43% were resistant to at least one of the eight antibiotics tested, with 31% of the isolates resistant to ampicillin, 23% to cefotaxime, 21% to tetracycline, 20% to cefazolin, and 17% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Most isolates harbored the blaTEM gene (29%), followed by blaCTX-M (23%), tet(A) (21%), and tet(B) (20%). Our results confirm the fecal carriage of antibiotic-resistant E. coli and clinically relevant resistance genes in stray cats. This study highlights the potential role of stray cats in the spread of AMR in urban environments, emphasising the need to better understand their role in AMR circulation when planning strategies to combat it.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The molecular mechanisms underlying fish responses to hypoxia and acidification stress have become a serious concern in recent years. This study revealed that hypoxia and acidification stress suppressed the growth of body length and height of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Subsequent transcriptome analyses of L. crocea juveniles under hypoxia, acidification, and hypoxia-acidification stress led to the identification of 5897 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the five groups. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses revealed that several DEGs were enriched in the 'protein digestion and absorption' pathway. Enrichment analysis revealed that this pathway was closely related to hypoxia and acidification stress in the five groups, and we found that genes of the collagen family may play a key role in this pathway. The zf-C2H2 transcription factor may play an important role in the hypoxia and acidification stress response, and novel genes were additionally identified. The results provide new clues for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia-acidification tolerance in L. crocea and provides a basic understanding of the potential combined effects of reduced pH and dissolved oxygen on Sciaenidae fishes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The possible transmission of Bbsl from companion animals to humans via ticks makes this disease important in terms of One Health approaches. Thus, early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are of utmost importance. Today's standard for the detection of specific antibodies against Bbsl is a two-tiered test system based on an ELISA for screening combined with a line immunoassay (LIA) for confirmation. In this study, 200 canine and 200 equine serum samples with known antibody status were tested with two different LIAs (A and B). Results were compared regarding sensitivity, specificity, the diagnostic outcome for dogs and horses, as well as operability of the test. The results for canine serum samples corresponded to 94.0%, making both LIAs a good choice for LB diagnostic in dogs. For equine serum samples, the agreement of both tests was 65.5%, displaying the challenge equine samples still provide in LB diagnostic. Major concerns were the interpretation of the OspA antigen (AG) signal and the use of unspecific (i.e., p100/p83) or too sensitive signals on the LIA. The operability of both LIAs was equally user-friendly. Regarding the tests' evaluation, the scanning process provided by LIA A was a major advantage considering the comparability of the tests.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pigs infected with these viruses show similar manifestations of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Here, a quadruplex real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was established for the differential detection of PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV from swine fecal samples. The assay showed extreme specificity, high sensitivity, and excellent reproducibility, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 121 copies/&#956;L (final reaction concentration of 12.1 copies/&#956;L) for each virus. The 3236 clinical fecal samples from Guangxi province in China collected between October 2020 and October 2022 were evaluated by the quadruplex qRT-PCR, and the positive rates of PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were 18.26% (591/3236), 0.46% (15/3236), 13.16% (426/3236), and 0.15% (5/3236), respectively. The samples were also evaluated by the multiplex qRT-PCR reported previously by other scientists, and the compliance rate between the two methods was more than 99%. This illustrated that the developed quadruplex qRT-PCR assay can provide an accurate method for the differential detection of four porcine enteric coronaviruses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We used this healthy reference dataset to explore how age, diet, and living environment correlate with fecal microbiome composition. Thirty core bacterial genera were identified. Prevotella, Bacteroides, Collinsella, Blautia, and Megasphaera were the most abundant, and Bacteroides, Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Sutterella, and Ruminococcus gnavus were the most prevalent. While community composition remained relatively stable across different age classes, the number of core taxa present decreased significantly with age. Fecal microbiome composition varied with host diet type. Cats fed kibble had a slightly, but significantly greater number of core taxa compared to cats not fed any kibble. The core microbiomes of cats fed some raw food contained taxa not as highly prevalent or abundant as cats fed diets that included kibble. Living environment also had a large effect on fecal microbiome composition. Cats living in homes differed significantly from those in shelters and had a greater portion of their microbiomes represented by core taxa. Collectively our work reinforces the findings that age, diet, and living environment are important factors to consider when defining a core microbiome in a population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At present, there are no reports on biological control measures of the disease. In this paper, the metabolomic analysis of vaginal secretions from susceptible and non-susceptible camels was performed by ACQUITY UPLC H-Class Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph. The results matched in 140 vaginal compounds. Methylheptenone, 1-octen-3-ol, and propyl butyrate and their mixtures were selected for gas chromatography-electroantennography (GC-EAD), electroantennography (EAG), behavioral experiments and trapping experiments of Wohlfahrtia magnifica (W. magnifica). Results showed that the W. magnifica had EAG responses to the three compounds, respectively. The EAG responses of female flies to different concentrations of methylheptenone were significantly different, but to the others had no significant difference, and there was no significant difference in the same compounds between the different sexes. Behavioral and trapping experiments showed that methylheptenone and 1-octen-3-ol have significant attraction to W. magnifica, but there was no significant difference to propyl butyrate. When methylheptenone and 1-octen-3-ol were mixed in different proportions, it was found that a mixture at the ratio of 1:1 and 0.5:1 had extremely significant and significant attraction, respectively, to both male and female W. magnifica. The study showed that, except for propyl butyrate, the higher the concentrations of the other two compounds, the stronger the attractivity to the W. magnifica, and a mixture at the ratio of 1:1 could enhance the attractivity to the W. magnifica.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the viruses harbored by this creature have been rarely investigated. Here, we report the DNA and RNA eukaryotic virome profiling of an injured Amur leopard cat followed by PCR validation, which revealed diverse anelloviruses in multiple organs and a bocaparvovirus in the lymph, but no RNA viruses. These anelloviruses have diverse genomic structures and are classified into four phylogroups with viruses of various felines, while the bocaparvovirus is extremely similar to those recovered from diarrheal domestic cats, illustrating the transmission of the virus between domestic animals and wildlife. These data provide the first insight into the genetic diversity of Amur leopard cat viruses, highlighting the need for further investigation of wild animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we first explored the effects of miR-708-5p on C2C12 proliferation and differentiation by overexpression and interference experiments. Then, we predicted the target genes of miR-708-5p and analyzed their function. We found that miR-708-5p was gradually increased during myoblast differentiation. Overexpression of miR-708-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted the differentiation of myoblasts. A total of 253 target genes were predicted using a bioinformatics approach. These genes were significantly enriched in muscle growth-related GO terms and KEGG pathways, such as actin filament organization, actin cytoskeleton organization, PI3K-Akt pathway, insulin pathway, and Jak-STAT pathway. Among them, Pik3ca, Pik3r3, and Irs1 were considered to be the key target genes of miR-708-5p. To sum up, miR-708-5p inhibited C2C12 cells proliferation and promoted C2C12 cells differentiation. Its target genes significantly enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways related to the development and growth of muscle. Our results provided a basis for studies on the function and mechanism of miR-708-5p regulating skeletal muscle growth and development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this case, a myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma was observed in a 5-year-old male African pygmy hedgehog. It consisted of ~60% of the myxoid substance area with proliferating round cells and ~30% of pleomorphic neoplastic cells. The subject presented with extrapulmonary metastasis, but a good prognosis during 6 months of follow-up, which is similar to the characteristics of myxoid liposarcoma. The histopathological features of myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma may reflect the features of either myxoid liposarcoma or pleomorphic liposarcoma depending on the proportion of each histopathological feature. The proportion of the pleomorphic area and the myxoid area may offer information on the prognosis and metastasis of myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma, which will be helpful for setting up a treatment plan. Thus, analyzing the proportion of pleomorphic area and myxoid area could be suggested as one of the ways to predict clinical outcomes. In addition to the fact that this is the first case of a myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma in hedgehogs, this case is meaningful, considering the unique histopathological characteristics and rare incidence of myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma that could be important in humans as well.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, as a retrospective study, 28 cases of spayed heifers were reviewed for postoperative changes after employing this method, with inclusion criteria including complete medical records for clinical observation, ultrasonography, measuring reproductive hormones, and tracking slaughter records. No mortality and heat signs at the pubertal age postoperatively occurred in spayed animals. On ultrasonography during rectal examination, the ovaries were enlarged without any folliculogenesis from one week, while massive ovarian edema appeared from two weeks, and ovaries were no longer palpable at four weeks post-surgery. In hormones, whereas estrogen and progesterone levels did not change from prepubertal to pubertal age in spayed animals, luteinizing hormone levels progressively increased during this period and reached a higher level at pubertal period than unspayed controls. Although carcass weight and yield were similar between groups upon slaughter at pubertal age, the spayed animals presented higher carcass quality (marbling degree) than that of controls. These results may contribute to develop herd management strategies, including control of estrus in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, by screening collections of enteric specimens from wild animals, a novel picornavirus was identified in the intestinal content of a badger (Meles meles). By enrichment with a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach and deep sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform, the genome sequence of a novel picornavirus strain, Badger/3A-2019/ITA, was reconstructed. On comparison based on the polyprotein sequences, the virus was distantly related (58.7% and 59.7% sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively) to the feline picornavirus strain FFUP1, identified in 2012 in Portugal and classified into genus Sakobovirus within the species Sakobuvirus A. Upon phylogenetic, pairwise homology, and distance analyses performed on the P1, 2C[hel], 3C[pro], and 3D[pol] proteins and the complete genomic sequence, the badger picornavirus may be considered a member of a new sakobuvirus species, which we propose as Sakobuvirus B.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this research is to use a retrospective analysis with data from 10 U.S. feedlots to determine potential associations between BRD risk during the first 45 days after arrival with pen-level management factors including the number of water sources, shared water sources, and shared fence lines. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate associations between management factors, cattle demographics, and BRD incidence. The effect of shared water sources on BRD risk was modified by arrival weight and cohort size (p &lt; 0.05). Cattle with two water sources had lower BRD morbidity (5.55% &#177; 0.98) compared to cattle with one water source (8.80% &#177; 1.50) when arrival weight was 227 kg to 272 kg, while there were few differences in heavier weight cattle. Cattle with two water sources had lower BRD morbidity (3.11% &#177; 0.56) compared to one water (5.50% &#177; 0.10) when cohort size was 100&#8722;175 head, but there were no BRD morbidity differences when bigger or smaller cohorts were evaluated. Shared fence lines and water sources were associated with BRD risk; however, no biologically meaningful results were identified. The number of water sources was associated with BRD risk, and effects were modified by cohort size and arrival weight.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Surgical techniques have been developed to stabilize the stifle, with an overall accepted benefit of tibial osteotomies among which is the tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA). Prior to surgery, the required TTA must be determined on a strict lateral radiographical view of the affected stifle with femur and tibia at an angle of 135&#176; as initially recommended. This value, initially determined in only two dog breeds, has been considered the mean standard value of the canine stifle angle during the mid-stance phase.</Abstract><Abstract>We sought to determine if this particular stifle angle around mid-stance phase was similar among multiple dog breeds. We built up a custom-made radiographic system for stifle angle measurement in standing dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>A mean value of stifle angle of 145&#176; was obtained. Mean stifle angle at mid-stance phase in a healthy dog is regularly higher than 135&#176; and is likely breed and individual dependent.</Abstract><Abstract>The pre-operative measurement of the required TTA made on stifles in 145&#176; extension, a value close to full physiological extension could contribute to decreasing the incidence of late post-operative meniscal lesion, consecutive to underestimation of TTA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36423096</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The Pivotal Role of Stem Cells in Veterinary Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering.</Title>	<Abstract>The introduction of new regenerative therapeutic modalities in the veterinary practice has recently picked up a lot of interest. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with a high capacity to self-renew and develop into tissue cells with specific roles. Hence, they are an effective therapeutic option to ameliorate the ability of the body to repair and engineer damaged tissues. Currently, based on their facile isolation and culture procedures and the absence of ethical concerns with their use, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most promising stem cell type for therapeutic applications. They are becoming more and more well-known in veterinary medicine because of their exceptional immunomodulatory capabilities. However, their implementation on the clinical scale is still challenging. These limitations to their use in diverse affections in different animals drive the advancement of these therapies. In the present article, we discuss the ability of MSCs as a potent therapeutic modality for the engineering of different animals' tissues including the heart, skin, digestive system (mouth, teeth, gastrointestinal tract, and liver), musculoskeletal system (tendons, ligaments, joints, muscles, and nerves), kidneys, respiratory system, and eyes based on the existing knowledge. Moreover, we highlighted the promises of the implementation of MSCs in clinical use in veterinary practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36423097</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Histomorphology and Chemical Constituents of Interdigital Gland of Vembur Sheep, Ovis aries.</Title>	<Abstract>The interdigital gland is a specialized skin gland located between the digits of Artiodactyla (i.e., even-toed ungulates). Its secretion participates in semiochemical communication, and protects from ultraviolet radiation as well as fungal and bacterial infections of the feet. The present study aimed at finding if there are male-female differences in the anatomy, morphology, and volatile compounds of the interdigital gland of the South Indian breed of Vembur sheep. A total of 24 sheep (12 each of male and female) were spotted at the slaughterhouse and the interdigital gland was removed for examination. The anatomical examination revealed it to resemble a tobacco pipe and to consist of a body, flexure, and excretory duct with an external orifice located at the cleft of the digits. Morphometrically, the interdigital glands differed between males and females. The gland possesses a distinct fibrous capsule, epidermis, and dermis. The fibrous capsule contains several parallel bundles of collagen fibers, nerve fibers, and blood vessels, etc. The epidermis consists of keratinized squamous epithelium formed of stratum basale, stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum. The dermis consists of hair follicles, nerve plexuses, arrector pili muscles, and apocrine and sebaceous glandular lobules. The latter, lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium, are arranged in clusters of acini in the upper portion of the dermis. The apocrine secretory lobules, made up of parenchymal cells, are found in the lower portion of the dermis. The density and diameter of the apocrine and sebaceous secretory lobules were significantly higher in the males than females. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis confirmed the apocrine and sebaceous secretory components. Twenty-three major compounds were identified in the interdigital gland postings of male and female sheep, among which butanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 1-heptanol and octadecanoic acid were present only in the male glandular post, whereas octane, 7-hexyl-tridecane, tetradecane, heptadecane and decanoic acid were present only in the female glandular post. Tetradecanol, tetradecanoic acid and hexadecanol peaks, reportedly antibacterial compounds in pronghorn antelopes, were highly prominent in both male and female sheep. Thus, the interdigital gland of Vembur sheep has two major secretory lobules, namely, sebaceous and apocrine, larger in males than females, which secrete a variety chemical compounds that may serve as chemical communication systems and protect the sheep from foot-borne diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hormones in the intrauterine environment play an important role in regulating PGs synthesis during implantation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, co-treatment of sheep trophoblast cells (STCs) with progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), and interferon-tau (IFN-&#964;) increased the ratio of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF2&#945;) and upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; (PPAR&#947;) expression, while inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and activating cellular autophagy. Under hormone treatment, inhibition of PPAR&#947; activity decreased the ratio of PGE2/PGF2&#945; and cellular activity, while activating expression of the mTOR downstream marker-the phosphorylation of p70S6K (p-p70S6K). We also found that the PPAR&#947;/mTOR pathway played an important role in regulating trophoblast cell function. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin increased the ratio of PGE2/PGF2&#945; and decreased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins after inhibiting PPAR&#947; activity. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of prostaglandin regulation of trophoblast cells in sheep during early pregnancy, indicating that the PPAR&#947;/mTOR pathway plays an important role in PGs secretion and cell viability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Colistin has been used in veterinary medicine since the 1950s. Due to the discovery of the plasmid-borne mcr gene in 2015 and the simultaneously increased importance in human medicine as a last-resort antibiotic, the use of colistin for animals was scrutinised. Though veterinary colistin sales dropped by 76.5% between 2011 to 2020, few studies evaluated real-world data on the use patterns of colistin in different European countries and sectors. A survey among veterinarians revealed that 51.9% did not use or ceased colistin, 33.4% decreased their use, 10.4% stabilised their use, and 2.7% increased use. The most important indications for colistin use were gastrointestinal diseases in pigs followed by septicaemia in poultry. A total of 106 (16.0%) responding veterinarians reported governmental/industry restrictions regarding colistin use, most commonly mentioning "use only after susceptibility testing" (57%). In brief, colistin was perceived as an essential last-resort antibiotic in veterinary medicine for E. coli infections in pigs and poultry, where there is no alternative legal, safe, and efficacious antimicrobial available. To further reduce the need for colistin, synergistic preventive measures, including improved biosecurity, husbandry, and vaccinations, must be employed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548812</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Preliminary Study on the Host Response to Bivalent and Monovalent Autogenous Vaccines against Mycoplasma agalactiae in Dairy Sheep.</Title>	<Abstract>In Italy, dairy sheep farming represents a vital agro-industry sector, but it is still challenged by contagious agalactia (CA), which is endemic there, and vaccination is the most economical and sustainable tool for control. This study aimed to evaluate the combined Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma)-Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) vaccine (Ma-Sa) against the Ma monovalent vaccine in ewes. Twelve primiparous Ma-free ewes were randomly grouped into three equal groups: first, the control group injected with placebo, second, the group vaccinated with the Ma monovalent vaccine, and third, the group vaccinated with Ma-Sa combined vaccine, with two S/C doses at 45-day intervals. The animals were examined for serological, hematological, and somatic cell count (SCC) changes for 17 successive weeks. A significant increase in anti-Ma antibody mean titers, leukocytes, and platelets was observed in the vaccinated animals, with the highest values in those who received the combined vaccine. Neutrophils were high only in the animals who received the combined vaccine. SCC was lower in the vaccinated animals during the first six weeks. This study concludes that the combined Ma-Sa vaccines enhance immune response and potentiate its efficacy against Ma. This improvement might be attributed to the sensitization/activation effect of S. aureus on platelets, which are recoded to act as a key regulator for the coordination of all components of the innate immune system. Even though this study included a small number of animals, its findings about the potentialities of this inactivated vaccine in the control of CA are strongly encouraging. Further confirmation might be needed through additional replicates and a challenge study is needed before proceeding with widespread use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An online questionnaire was sent twice to all 54 AAVMC members and sent once to a veterinary toxicology list serve. The survey covered areas related to instructor demographics, the depth and extent of toxicology taught, and the respondent's perceptions of their student's ability to perform entrustable professional activities (EPA). Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Our survey resulted in a 44% response rate. All responding schools included toxicology in their curriculum, and it was a required course in 23 programs. Contact hours in stand-alone veterinary toxicology courses ranged from 14 to 45 h. Most respondents indicated that the current time allotted for toxicology was inadequate, despite indicating that most of their students could perform most EPAs autonomously. One exception related to the ability of students to analyze toxicology data. We found small variations in teaching methods and curriculum content. The results of our study can assist veterinary schools in evaluating their curricula to better prepare new graduates for the management of toxicology issues they may face in their veterinary careers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548814</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Rothia nasimurium as a Cause of Disease: First Isolation from Farmed Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Rothia nasimurium is a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive coccus belonging to the Rothia genus of the Micrococcaceae family. While Rothia nasimurium is considered an opportunistic pathogen, to date few studies have investigated its pathogenicity and drug resistance. In January 2022, chickens at a poultry farm in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region became ill and died. Treatment with commonly used Chinese medicines and antibiotics was ineffective, causing economic losses to the poultry farm. In order to determine the cause of the disease in these poultry farm chickens, the isolation and identification of the pathogens in the livers and other internal organs of the sick and dead chickens were performed. Further, animal pathogenicity tests, antibiotic susceptibility tests, and the detection of antibiotic resistance genes were carried out to analyze the pathogenicity and drug resistance of the identified pathogens. A Gram-positive coccus was isolated from the livers of the diseased chickens. The isolate was resistant to 17 antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and florfenicol, and was only sensitive to penicillin, amikacin, and tigecycline, to varying degrees. The results of the drug resistance gene testing indicated that the isolated bacterium carried 13 kinds of resistance genes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, morphological observations, biochemical tests, and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis were performed on the isolated bacterium, and it was determined that the isolated bacterial strain was Rothia nasimurium. The animal pathogenicity tests showed that the isolate caused feather loss and death in chicks; the clinical symptoms and necropsy lesions of the test chicks were consistent with those observed in the farmed chickens. A review of the literature revealed that, to date, there are no reports of infection with Rothia nasimurium in chickens. Thus, in this study, Rothia nasimurium was isolated from chickens for the first time and an investigation of the biological characteristics of the bacterium was carried out in order to provide a reference for the clinical treatment, prevention, and control of Rothia nasimurium infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, data in cats are scarce, and no information is available on the potential impact of nutritional interventions on the feline urine proteome. In the present study, a label-free shotgun proteomics approach was performed to investigate the urinary proteins of four healthy adult cats. Each animal received a high-protein complete diet without (w/o) or with supplements that could affect the protein metabolism: arginine (+100% compared to the arginine concentration in the w/o diet), ornithine (+200% compared to the arginine concentration in the w/o diet) or zeolite (0.375 g/kg body weight/day). Our results demonstrate a huge number of proteins in the urine of cats (516 &#177; 49, 512 &#177; 39, 399 &#177; 149 and 455 &#177; 134 in the w/o, arginine, ornithine and zeolite group, respectively), which are associated with several biological processes. In addition, up- and downregulated urinary proteins could be detected in the dietary supplementation periods. Overall, the present pilot study provides basic data on the urine proteome of healthy adult cats. With increasing information, the numerousness of urinary proteins implies the potential to identify biomarkers and metabolic pathways in the feline organism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, we also hypothesized cardiac involment for dogs affected by SIRS. To assess this hypothesis, 24 dogs with a diagnosis of SIRS (13 entire males, 7 entire females, and 4 spayed females) with an age ranging from 4 to 11 years (mean 5.6 years) and an average weight of 24 kg (range from 5 to 47 kg) were enrolled. The dogs were divided into two groups according to their prognosis: Survivors (G1) and not survivors (G2), composed by 13 and 11 dogs, respectively. Moreover, healthy dogs were included as the control group (CTR). All the dogs with a history of cardiac or renal disease were excluded. At the inclusion, each patient underwent a physical examination and a complete cell count, and a biochemistry panel (including electrolyte profile) was performed; moreover, the blood cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) was measured. For each clinical variable indicative of SIRS, a score between 0 (absence) and 1 (presence) was applied. Furthermore, an electrocardiographic examination was recorded. Seventeen out of 24 (70.8%) dogs with SIRS showed arrhythmias, of which n. 6 belonged to the G1, while n. 11 belonged to the G2. Most represented findings were sinus tachycardia (7/17; 41.1%), followed by monomorphic premature ventricular beats (6/17; 35.3%), less common were first-degree atrioventricular block (2/17; 11.7%) and sinus bradycardia 1/17; 5.8%). Notably, in G1 dogs, only sinus tachycardia and premature ventricular beats were observed. G2 dogs presented a number of total and banded leukocytes significantly higher than those of G1 (p = 0.002 and 0.049), in the same manner, the clinical score suggestive of SIRS (3 vs. 2.1) was significantly higher in G2 than in G1 dogs (p = 0.01). Moreover, a significantly higher value of cTnI was observed in the G2 group compared to the G1 group (p = 0.006). Data presented here suggested a cardiac involvement in dogs with SIRS, analogously to humans, that may significantly influence the patient's prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the information on Chlamydia infection in sheep was limited in Shanxi Province, northern China. In the present study, a total of 984 serum samples of sheep were collected from 11 regions in Shanxi Province, northern China in the autumn of 2020. The antibodies against Chlamydia and Chlamydia abortus were examined by the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The result showed that 351 (35.67%, 95% CI 32.68-38.66) of 984 serum samples were positive for Chlamydia, and the seroprevalence ranged from 6.67% to 70.79% among the different regions. In addition, antibodies to C. abortus infection were detected in 78 (7.93%, 95% CI 6.24-9.61) of 984 serum samples, and the seroprevalence ranged from 6.24% to 14.81% among the different regions. This is the first report on the seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus in sheep in Shanxi province, northern China. The findings provide baseline information for preventing and controlling Chlamydia infection in sheep in Shanxi Province, China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They are required to complete the development within the limited space of host intestines, and some synergistic or antagonistic effects occur among different Eimeria species. This study evaluated the impact of Eimeria mitis on the outcome of Eimeria necatrix or Eimeria tenella challenge infection. The severity of E. mitis/E. necatrix and E. mitis/E. tenella mixed infections were quantified by growth performance evaluation, survival rate analysis, lesion scoring, blood stool scoring, and oocyst output counting. The presence of E. mitis exacerbated the outcome of co-infection with E. tenella, causing high mortality, intestinal lesion score, and oocyst production. However, E. mitis/E. tenella co-infection had little impact on the body weight gain compared to individual E. tenella infection. In addition, the presence of E. mitis appeared not to enhance the pathogenicity of E. necatrix, although it tends to inhibit the growth of challenged birds and facilitate oocyst output and mortality in an E. mitis/E. necatrix co-infection model. Collectively, the results suggested a synergistic relationship between E. mitis and E. tenella/E. necatrix when sharing the same host. The presence of E. mitis contributed to disease pathology induced by E. tenella and might also advance the impact of E. necatrix in co-infections. These observations indicate the importance of accounting for differences in the relationships among different Eimeria species when using mixed infection models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of bile obtained from sheep gallbladder on the sporulation and morphology of Eimeria stiedae oocysts and sporozoites affecting rabbit liver cells and to determine the best concentration for sporulation inhibition. Sporulation inhibition per milliliter was measured in samples exposed to five concentrations of sheep bile (SB) in a 2.5% potassium dichromate solution: 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% concentrations for oocysticidal activity and 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 &#956;g/mL concentrations for antisporozoidal activity. A bioassay was performed to assess the in vitro anticoccidial activity of sheep bile against E. stiedae oocysts and sporozoite sporulation. In this assay, six-well plates with 5 mL of bile containing 1000 oocysts showed unsporulated oocysticidal activity after 48, 72, and 96 h and antisporozoidal activity after 12 and 24 h. A chemical assay was performed via infrared spectroscopy to investigate the presence of several anticipated active chemical compounds in sheep bile. Sheep bile was able to inhibit E. stiedae oocysts at 100% and 75% concentrations by about 91% and 81%, respectively. In addition, SB had the highest inhibition of E. stiedae sporozoite viability (92%) at a concentration of 1000 &#956;g/mL and had the lowest inhibition of 8% at a concentration of 125 &#956;g/mL. An increase in the incubation time and a higher dose generally increased the inhibition rate. The results showed that sheep gallbladder bile is effective due to its inhibitory potential and effect on the coccidian oocyst sporulation of E. stiedae. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active chemicals present in SB and their modes of action and application in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It causes bovine mastitis that currently cannot be cured, and hence generates significant economic losses in milk production. In this study, for the first time in Ecuador, we identify Prototheca bovis as the etiologic agent of chronic mastitis in dairy cattle. Milk samples (n = 458) of cows with chronic mastitis were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA). Microscopy and cytB gene sequencing were used to identify Prototheca, whereby Prototheca bovis was isolated from 15.1% (n = 69) of the milk samples, one of the highest infection rates that can be found in the literature in a "non-outbreak" situation. No other Prototheca species were found. We were unable to isolate the alga from environmental samples. We showed that P. bovis was relatively resistant to disinfectants used to sterilize milking equipment on the cattle farms where it was isolated. We discuss how to avoid future infection and also hypothesize that the real prevalence of Prototheca infection in bovine mastitis is probably much higher than what was detected. We recommend a protocol to increase the diagnostic yield in the bacteriology laboratory.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A hot water bottle (HWB) can be carried into an MRI examination room and can contribute to the prevention or attenuation of hypothermia. Here, we retrospectively investigated the effects of HWB on body temperature during MRI examinations in dogs under general anesthesia (GA). From anesthesia records of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Okayama University of Science, validated data of 100 dogs that underwent an MRI examination under GA were obtained and divided into the following two groups: one group received HWB, while the other did not. Decrease in rectal temperature 15 min after intubation was significantly smaller in the group using HWB than in the group without HWB. In conclusion, the use of hot water bottles might be one of the methods to attenuate hypothermia in the early period but should not be expected for complete prevention of hypothermia, and it was not recommendable necessarily for body temperature management during MRI examinations in dogs under general anesthesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study evaluated differences in miRNAs levels in fat and cellular fractions of tank milk collected from commercial farms which employ extensive or intensive dairy production systems. We first sequenced miRNAs in three milk samples from each production system, and then validated miRNAs whose levels in the cellular and fat fraction differed significantly between the two production systems. To accomplish this, we used quantitative PCR with both fractions of tank milk samples from another 20 commercial farms. Differences in miRNAs were identified in fat fractions: overall levels of miRNAs, and, specifically, the levels of bta-mir-215, were higher in intensive systems than in extensive systems. Bovine mRNA targets for bta-miR-215 and their pathway analysis were performed. While the causes of these miRNAs differences remain to be elucidated, our results suggest that the type of production system could affect miRNAs levels and potential functionality of agri-food products of animal origin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infection in cattle can cause abortion and infertility, however, there is little epidemiological information regarding the disease in dairy cattle in Tanzania. Between July 2019 and October 2020, a serosurvey was conducted in six high dairy producing regions of Tanzania. Cattle sera were tested for antibodies to C. burnetii using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A mixed effect logistic regression model identified risk factors associated with C. burnetii seropositivity. A total of 79 out of 2049 dairy cattle tested positive with an overall seroprevalence of 3.9% (95% CI 3.06-4.78) across the six regions with the highest seroprevalence in Tanga region (8.21%, 95% CI 6.0-10.89). Risk factors associated with seropositivity included: extensive feeding management (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.25-3.77), and low precipitation below 1000 mm (OR 2.76, 95% 1.37-7.21). The disease seroprevalence is relatively low in the high dairy cattle producing regions of Tanzania. Due to the zoonotic potential of the disease, future efforts should employ a "One Health" approach to understand the epidemiology, and for interdisciplinary control to reduce the impacts on animal and human health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Before castration, one group was injected with intrafunicular (FL) lidocaine and the other received intratesticular (TL) lidocaine. All ponies were premedicated with acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Twenty minutes after the administration of acepromazine, xylazine (1 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.02 mg/kg) were administered intravenously. Lidocaine 2% was given 1 mL/100 kg intrafunicularly in the FL groups or 2 mL/100 kg intratesticularly on each testicular side for TL. Surgery was performed by the same team of two experienced surgeons using Serra's emasculator and an open technique was used for all ponies in order to promote postoperative drainage. In this study, we focused on the plasmatic levels of TNF-&#945; and IL-6. The results from this study showed a significant difference in plasmatic concentrations of TNF-&#945; and IL-6 between the two different locoregional anaesthetic protocols. Taken together, the results suggest that the intrafunicular lidocaine locoregional anaesthesia could be a useful technique in the anaesthesia protocol for field pony castration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics in a cohort of 30 dogs with RS. Signalment, clinical features, results of diagnostic tests, final diagnosis, and evolution were retrospectively evaluated. Sex and neuter status were equally distributed into diagnosis categories. A significantly higher representation of toys (&lt;5 kg, 50%) and small-sized dogs (5&#8722;15 kg, 27%), in comparison to medium (15&#8722;30 kg, 17%) and large-sized dogs (&gt;30 kg, 7%), was found. RS was the main owner concern in many of the cases (67%). Many cases presented chronic RS (60%, &gt; 3 months), with more than one episode a week (60%). Most cases had an additional clinical respiratory sign (63%) and an unremarkable physical examination (63%). Inflammatory airway disorders were present in 57% of the cases, followed by anatomical&#8722;functional disorders (27%), and nasal/nasopharyngeal foreign bodies (10%). Two dogs (7%) remained as open diagnoses. Episodes of RS were persistent despite the treatment in 61% of the dogs with follow-up. Although some dogs manifest infrequent episodes of RS, being otherwise normal, RS should be considered a marker of potential irritation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and should always be sufficiently investigated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548827</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Detection of Colistin Sulfate on Piglet Gastrointestinal Tract Microbiome Alterations.</Title>	<Abstract>The gut microbiome exerts important functions on host health maintenance, whereas excessive antibiotic use may cause gut flora dysfunction resulting in serious disease and dysbiosis. Colistin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with serious resistance phenomena. However, it is unclear whether colistin alters the gastrointestinal tract microbiome in piglets. In this study, 16s rDNA-based metagenome analyses were used to assess the effects of colistin on the modification of the piglet microbiome in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, cecum, and feces. Both &#945;- and &#946;-diversity indices showed that colistin modified microbiome composition in these gastrointestinal areas. In addition, colistin influenced microbiome composition at the phylum and genus levels. At the species level, colistin upregulated Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Lactobacillus agilis, Weissella paramesenteroides, and Lactobacillus salivarius abundance, but downregulated Actinobacillus indolicus, Campylobacter fetus, Glaesserella parasuis, Moraxella pluranimalium, Veillonella caviae, Neisseria dentiae, and Prevotella disiens abundance in stomachs. Colistin-fed piglets showed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus mucosae, Megasphaera elsdenii DSM 20460, Fibrobacter intestinalis, and Unidentified rumen bacterium 12-7, but Megamonas funiformis, Uncultured Enterobacteriaceae bacterium, Actinobacillus porcinus, Uncultured Bacteroidales bacterium, and Uncultured Clostridiaceae bacterium abundance was decreased in the cecum. In feces, colistin promoted Mucispirillum schaedleri, Treponema berlinense, Veillonella magna, Veillonella caviae, and Actinobacillus porcinus abundance when compared with controls. Taken together, colistin modified the microbiome composition of gastrointestinal areas in piglets. This study provides new clinical rationalization strategies for colistin on the maintenance of animal gut balance and human public health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although giant pandas feed almost exclusively on bamboo, they retain carnivorous traits and suffer from carnivorous diseases. Additionally, their immune system is susceptible to aging, resulting in a reduced ability to respond to diseases. This study aimed to determine the genes and pathways expressed differentially with age in blood tissues. The differentially expressed genes in different age groups of giant pandas were identified by RNA-seq. The elderly giant pandas had many differentially expressed genes compared with the young group (3 years old), including 548 upregulated genes and 401 downregulated genes. Further, functional enrichment revealed that innate immune upregulation and adaptive immune downregulation were observed in the elderly giant pandas compared with the young giant pandas. Meanwhile, the immune genes in the elderly giant pandas changed considerably, including genes involved in innate immunity and adaptive immunity such as PLSCR1, CLEC7A, CCL5, CCR9, and EPAS1. Time series analysis found that giant pandas store glycogen by prioritizing fat metabolism at age 11, verifying changes in the immune system. The results reported in this study will provide a foundation for further research on disease prevention and the energy metabolism of giant pandas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The piglets were allocated randomly into 4 dietary groups, which were a control diet (NC), NC + 150 ppm mucilage sulfate (PC), and 3 additional diets containing 1 kg/t (LT), 1.5 kg/t (MT), or 2 kg/t (HT) mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Results showed that joint application of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis increased ADFI and ADG of weaned piglets in d 14~28 and d 28~42 (p &lt; 0.05), and decreased serum concentrations of DAO, IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;, and IL-2. The LT group increased jejunal and colonic sIgA contents compared with the PC group (p &lt; 0.05). Groups of MT and HT increased colonic mRNA expression of host defense peptides and tight junction proteins compared with the NC and PC groups. The joint application of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis increased the abundance of colonic Lactobacillus compared with NC and PC groups (p &lt; 0.10). In conclusion, the joint application of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis as an antibiotics alternative improved growth performance via promoting immune function and intestinal integrity of weaned piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To ensure the effective delivery of psychological interventions, it is important to explore factors which may improve the therapeutic alliance. There are well-documented effects of human-animal interactions in social settings, and researchers have also considered the effect of dog presence on the therapeutic alliance. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Database searches included CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed the effect of dog presence on the therapeutic alliance and provided a quantitative outcome measure. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Three of the included studies observed no significant effect of dog presence on the therapeutic alliance; three studies did observe a positive effect, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.10 to d = 0.58. All six studies took place in either research or clinical settings. Studies differed in terms of help-seeking versus non-help-seeking populations, where help-seeking populations were genuinely pursuing a psychological intervention. Heterogeneity was observed regarding study procedure and outcome measures used. Current data is limited, and initial evidence suggests that the effect of dog presence on the therapeutic alliance remains unclear, illustrated by inconsistent outcomes across the included studies. Further research is warranted before introducing dogs into therapeutic settings for this purpose.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Histology of the superficial aspects of the mass revealed epidermal cells arranged in nests and trabeculae while the deeper parts of the mass consisted of small round cells arranged in sheets or bundles of elongate spindle-shaped cells. A diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was made. Approximately 40% of the cells throughout the neoplasm contained prominent papillomaviral (PV)-induced cell changes. The BCC recurred three months after excision and grew rapidly. At this time a smaller mass was observed on the thorax. Due to the rapid recurrence of the BCC, the cat was euthanatized. As in the initial mass, histology of the recurrent mass revealed pleomorphic cells that often contained PV-induced cell changes. In contrast, the thoracic mass appeared as a more typical BCC and contained no histological evidence of PV infection. A novel PV DNA sequence was amplified from the flank BCC. While the sequence was most (75.1%) similar to Felis catus papillomavirus (FcaPV) 6, the level of similarity between the sequences is consistent with a novel PV type. No PV DNA was amplifiable from the thoracic mass. The case is unique due to the histological features of the BCC and the presence of a putative novel PV type. Observations from the present case add to the number of PV types associated with disease in cats as well as increasing the spectrum of PV-induced lesions in this species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548832</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Intestinal Microbiota in Lambs with Different Susceptibility to Escherichia coli F17.</Title>	<Abstract>Diarrhea is one of the most commonly reported diseases in young farm animals. Escherichia coli (E. coli) F17 is one of the major pathogenic bacteria responsible for diarrhea. However, the pathogenicity of diarrhea in lambs involving E. coli F17 strains and how E. coli F17 infection modifies lambs' intestinal microbiota are largely unknown. To evaluate diarrhea in newborn lambs with an infection of E. coli F17, 50 lambs were selected for challenge experiments and divided into four groups, namely, a high-dose challenge group, low-dose challenge group, positive control group, and negative control group. The E. coli F17 challenge experiments caused diarrhea and increased mortality in the experimental lamb population, with a higher prevalence (90%), mortality (35%), and rapid onset time (4-12 h) being observed in the high-dose challenge group than the results observed in the low-dose challenge group (75%, 10%, 6-24 h, respectively). After the challenge experiment, healthy lambs in the high-dose challenge group and severely diarrheic lamb in the low-dose challenge group were identified as lambs sensitive/resistant to E. coli F17 (E. coli F17 -resistant/-sensitive candidate, AN/SE) according to the histopathological detection. Results of intestinal contents bacteria plate counting revealed that the number of bacteria in the intestinal contents of SE lambs was 10[2~3]-fold greater than that of the AN lambs, especially in the jejunum. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted to profile the intestinal microbiota using the jejunal contents, and the results showed that SE lambs had higher Lactococcus and a lower Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio and intestinal microbiota diversity in the jejunum than AN lambs. Notably, high abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii was revealed in AN lambs, which indicated that Megasphaera elsdenii may serve as a potential probiotic for E. coli F17 infection. Our study provides an alternative challenge model for the identification of E. coli F17-sensitive/-resistant lambs and contributes to the basic understandings of intestinal microbiota in lambs with different susceptibilities to E. coli F17.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548833</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Impact of Supplementing Phytobiotics as a Substitute for Antibiotics in Broiler Chicken Feed on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, and Biochemical Parameters.</Title>	<Abstract>To determine the level of application and the effectiveness of the use of plant feed additives from sweet chestnut wood extract (Castanea Sativa Mill) in the diet of Cobb-500 cross broiler chickens, four groups were formed via the balanced groups method. The chickens in the experimental groups were supplemented with sweet chestnut wood extract in the main diet rather than a feed antibiotic at an amount of 500 g per ton of compound starter feed and 250 g per ton of grower and finisher in the second experimental group; 650 g per ton of compound starter feed and 325 g per ton of grower and finisher in the third experimental group; and 800 g per ton of compound starter feed and 400 g per ton of grower and finisher in the fourth experimental group. Supplementation with phytobiotics led to an increase in the digestibility of the dry matter in the second and third groups compared to the first experimental group. Furthermore, broiler chickens supplemented with a medium dose of phytobiotics revealed a significant difference in both crude protein and fiber when compared to the second experimental group (91.95% and 12.11% vs. 88.98% and 10.07%, respectively). The preslaughter weight of the birds in the phytobiotics supplemented groups was higher than in those fed with the lowest dosage of phytobiotic by 5.47%, and the difference was significant. There were no significant differences in terms of the blood biochemical parameters between the groups. In summary, the inclusion of plant feed additives from sweet chestnut wood extract as a substitute for an antibacterial drug in the diet of broiler chickens did not deteriorate the blood biochemical parameters and improved the intensity of the nutrient digestion process. As a result, it enhanced the quality indicators of the broiler carcass during the entire growth period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Knowing the thermal windows to evaluate and maintain a constant temperature helps significantly reduce neonatal mortality. This study aimed to assess the superficial temperature alterations in the distinct thermal windows of puppies with mothers of diverse weights and their repercussions. We evaluated the superficial temperature using infrared thermography at eight thermal windows and seven different times: when wet due to the fetal fluid immediately after birth until 24 h of life in newborn puppies from bitches divided into four bodyweight groups. The results revealed a positive correlation between the dam's weight and the ability to achieve thermostability in the newborn puppies in all the evaluated thermal windows. The time effect showed the lowest temperatures when the puppies were still wet, a gradual increase, and the highest temperature at 24 h after birth. The thermal windows with the highest temperatures were abdominal, thoracic, nasal, and upper left palpebral, and those with the lowest were the thoracic limb brachial biceps, thoracic limb elbow, metacarpal, and femoral pelvic limb. A significant increase in the temperatures in the thermal windows of the abdominal, thoracic, and upper left palpebral immediately after ingesting colostrum was observed. The weight of the dams is an important factor that positively intervenes in the thermoregulatory capacity of the puppies, especially when newborns are dry and have been passed 24 h after birth.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548835</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Experimental Infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae Strain 232 in Swine Influences the Lower Respiratory Microbiota.</Title>	<Abstract>Mycoplasma (M.) hyopneumoniae, the etiological agent of swine enzootic pneumonia, has been reported to increase the susceptibility to secondary infections and modulate the respiratory microbiota in infected pigs. However, no studies have assessed the influence of M. hyopneumoniae on the respiratory microbiota diversity under experimental conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of M. hyopneumoniae infection on the respiratory microbiota of experimentally infected swine over time. To accomplish this, 12 weaned pigs from a M. hyopneumoniae-free farm were divided into two groups: M. hyopneumoniae strain 232 infected (n = 8) and non-infected (n = 4). The first group received 10 mL of Friis medium containing 10[7] CCU/mL of M. hyopneumoniae while the control group received 10 mL of sterile Friis medium. Inoculation of both groups was performed intratracheally when the animals were 35 days old (d0). At 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) and 56 dpi, 4 infected animals plus 2 controls were humanely euthanized, and biopsy samples of nasal turbinates (NT) and bronchus-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected. The DNA was extracted from the individual samples, and each group had the samples pooled and submitted to next-generation sequencing. Taxonomic analysis, alpha and beta diversity indexes, weighted unifrac, and unweighted unifrac distances were calculated. A high relative frequency (99%) of M. hyopneumoniae in BALF samples from infected animals was observed with no significant variation between time points. The infection did not seem to alter the diversity and evenness of bacterial communities in NT, thus, M. hyopneumoniae relative frequency was low in NT pools from infected animals (28 dpi-0.83%; 56 dpi-0.89%). PCoA diagrams showed that BALF samples from infected pigs were grouped and far from the control samples, whereas NT from infected animals were not separated from the control. Under the present coditions, M. hyopneumoniae infection influenced the lower respiratory microbiota, which could contribute to the increased susceptibility of infected animals to respiratory infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It can cause perihepatitis, pericarditis, septicemia and even systemic infections in the poultry industry. With the incidence of antibiotic resistance reaching a crisis point, it is important to find alternative treatments for multidrug-resistant infections. The use of phages to control pathogens is a promising therapeutic option for antibiotic replacement. In this study, we isolated a lytic phage called vB_EcoS_GN06 from sewage. It lysed APEC GXEC-N22. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the phage belongs to family Siphoviridae. Phage GN06 has a 107,237 bp linear double-stranded DNA genome with 39.2% GC content and 155 coding sequences. It belongs to the genus Tequintavirus, subfamily Markadamsvirinae. The multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and the one-step growth showed that the latent time is 60 min and the burst size is 434 PFU/cell. Temperature and pH stability tests showed that phage GN06 was stable in the range of 4 &#176;C-60 &#176;C and pH 5-9. GN06 showed significant inhibition of APEC both within the liquid medium and in biofilm formation. These results suggest that phage GN06 has the potential to control bacterial pathogens. Thus, GN06 has the potential to be a new potential candidate for phage therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, due to the lack of a highly effective culture system in vitro, a genetically engineered subunit vaccine is the main direction of vaccine development. In this study, ORF3 genes of VaHEV strain from laying hens and YT-aHEV strain from broilers were amplified, respectively, and ORF3 protein was successfully expressed by Escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system. The serum samples were collected periodically to detect avian HEV antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence after specific pathogen free chickens immunized with the two proteins and their mixed proteins, the results showed that all serum samples were positive for antibodies to avian HEV. The antibody-positive chickens were artificially challenged with the cell-adapted strain YT-aHEV strain. The chickens from the immunized control group were infected successfully; no fecal detoxification was detected in the immunized group. In this study, two representative strains of ORF3 subunit vaccines of laying hens and broilers were prepared by prokaryotic expression, the immune effects of different proteins of these were evaluated through immunization and challenge studies in vivo, which provided a new technical possibility for prevention and control of avian HEV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Whether the new owners had been informed about the presence of a murmur before purchasing a puppy was not investigated. Methods: New owners whose dogs were diagnosed with a congenital heart disease at the authors' institution in a 1-year period received a questionnaire during the consult after cardiac auscultation but before performing an echocardiogram. The main study aims were to reveal whether the breeders had informed the new owners about the presence of a murmur before purchasing the puppy, and whether the owners would have still chosen to buy that specific puppy if they had known about a potentially present congenital heart disease. Results: Of the 60 interviewed owners, 72% would have refrained from buying the puppy if they had known about the presence of a congenital heart disease. However, only 23% of them were informed about the presence of a cardiac murmur before purchase. Conclusions: Most owners would have chosen to buy a healthy puppy without a heart disease if they had been informed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess the presence of taeniid eggs and, in particular, E. granulosus s.l., in environmental samples in the city of Ibadan, South West Nigeria. To this purpose, soil (n = 200), fecal (n = 200) and water samples (n = 50) were examined by microscopic observation and the multiplex PCR method. The influence of specific environmental factors on E. granulosus s.l. egg dispersion was also evaluated. Taeniid eggs were microscopically found in 11.5%, 25.5% and 8.0% of soil, fecal and water samples, respectively. PCR analyses evidenced the presence of E. granulosus s.l. in 8.0%, 24.0% and 2.0% of soil, fecal and water samples, respectively. The proximity to slaughterhouses, the level of urbanisation and the local government area of belonging did not seem to affect E. granulosus s.l. egg dissemination patterns. Our results have clearly demonstrated that both urban and semi-urban areas of the city of Ibadan in Nigeria are highly contaminated by taeniid eggs and we recommend the adoption of appropriate measures to control E. granulosus s.l.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The hematocrit level was 18.8% (normal range: 36-56%), indicating severe anemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a round-to-oval-shaped mass in the stomach. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intraluminal mass (17 &#215; 12 &#215; 15 mm) cranial to the pyloric antrum. After obtaining informed consent from the owner, exploratory laparotomy and subsequent gastrostomy were performed, showing an ulcerated mass potentially responsible for the severe anemia. A lump of hair was firmly attached to the ulcerated surface of the mass. After complete removal of the mass, the anemia resolved spontaneously. Histological examination revealed that the mass was a gastric hyperplastic polyp. At the 6-month follow-up, the dog was healthy with a normal hematocrit level. Gastric hyperplastic polyps are tumor-like lesions arising from the mucosal surface of the stomach, and projecting into the lumen. They can appear in any part of the stomach, and are usually found incidentally during gastric endoscopy or necropsy. The clinical signs include chronic occult blood loss, abdominal pain, and gastric tract obstruction. Gastric polyps causing acute blood loss anemia have rarely been reported in human medicine. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a gastric hyperplastic polyp that caused severe anemia because of acute blood loss in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we examined the impact of breeding season on haemosporidian infection in free-range chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). We sampled a total of 122 chickens (66 chickens during the breeding season of April 2017 and 56 chickens during the non-breeding season of January 2017) to test for haemosporidian infections. The result showed that 56 out of 66 chickens examined during the breeding season tested positive for parasites (84.8% parasite prevalence), whereas 39 out of 56 chickens tested positive for parasites during the non-breeding season (69.6% parasite prevalence). Moreover, among the 11 Leucocytozoon lineages and 2 Plasmodium lineages identified, the parasite lineages that infected chickens during the breeding season were more diversified than those that affected chickens during the non-breeding season. This study indicated that chickens have a higher incidence of haemosporidian infection and a greater diversity of haemosporidian parasite lineages during the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As cardiovascular events occur, chymase is activated by degranulation to the extracellular matrix. Although chymase has been suggested to be associated with cardiovascular disease progression, there are not enough reports in veterinary medicine. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common congenital cardiac disease in veterinary medicine. Almost all cases of PDA can be treated surgically to prevent the development of congestive heart disease and/or pulmonary hypertension. The aims of the present study were to measure chymase activity before and after PDA occlusions, and to investigate the relationships between the congestive and hemodynamic states of PDA and chymase activity. In the present study, 17 puppies diagnosed with PDA were included and all puppies completely recovered to the level of healthy dogs. Chymase activity significantly decreased at 2 months after the operation, along with the echocardiography parameters of congestion. Therefore, plasma chymase activity may be useful as a novel predictor for understanding the hemodynamics of PDA in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

From the 26th week of life, ISA Brown laying hens were fed either a wheat-corn diet or a diet containing 25% rye, with or without xylanase. The experimental period lasted for 25 weeks, until birds reached their 50th week of age, after which bone and eggshell quality indices were assessed. Eggshell thickness and eggshell Ca content of eggs from rye-fed hens were improved by xylanase supplementation. No differences in the mechanical properties of the eggshells were observed between treatments, except for the diet-dependent changes in egg deformation. Rye inclusion had no effect on the mechanical properties of bone. Xylanase supplementation, irrespective of the diet, had a positive effect on bone strength and increased tibia Ca content, as well as the content of several microelements. Hence, hybrid rye combined with wheat can replace 25% of corn in layer diets without compromising shell quality or bone mineral content. Xylanase supplementation in these diets is recommended since its inclusion improves both bone strength and quality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The parasite is able to transmit numerous pathogens to honeybees which can lead to colony collapse. In recent years, the effectiveness of authorized drug products has decreased due to increasing resistance phenomena. Therefore, the search for alternatives to commercially available drugs is mandatory. In this context, essential oils (EOs) prove to be a promising choice to be studied for their known acaricide properties. In this research work, the acaricide activity of EO vapours isolated from the epigeal part (whole plant) of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare sbps. piperitum) and its three fractions (leaves, achenes and flowers) against V. destructor was evaluated. The effectiveness of fumigation was studied using two methods. The first involved prolonged exposure of mites to oil vapour for variable times. After exposure, the five mites in each replicate were placed in a Petri dish with an Apis mellifera larva. Mortality, due to chronic toxicity phenomena, was assessed after 48 h. The second method aimed to translate the results obtained from the in vitro test into a semi-field experiment. Therefore, two-level cages were set up. In the lower compartment of the cage, a material releasing oil vapours was placed; in the upper compartment, Varroa-infested honeybees were set. The results of the first method showed that the increase in mortality was directly proportional to exposure time and concentration. The whole plant returned 68% mortality at the highest concentration (2 mg/mL) and highest exposure time (48 h control), while the leaves, achenes and flowers returned 64%, 52% and 56% mortality, respectively. In the semi-field experiment, a concentration up to 20 times higher than the one used in the in vitro study was required for the whole plant to achieve a similar mite drop of &gt;50%. The results of the study show that in vitro tests should only be used for preliminary screening of EO activity. In vitro tests should be followed by semi-field tests, which are essential to identify the threshold of toxicity to bees and the effective dose to be used in field studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of coprophagy on digestibility, fecal pH, and fermentative metabolites. Twelve healthy dogs with a mean age of 3.50 &#177; 1.45 years were included and divided into two groups: coprophagic (COP) and non-coprophagic (NCOP). The study lasted 30 days, the last 6 days being used to collect feces for the analysis of the apparent digestibility of coefficients (ADC), fecal pH, and the concentration of short- and branched-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and fecal lactic acid. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software. No differences were observed for most variables, except for the ADC of nitrogen-free extract (NFE), which presented the highest average for the COP. This result should be interpreted with caution, as the NFE is estimated from calculations and was not determined in the laboratory; in addition, the results represent not only starch and sugars but also some parts referring to fibers. Therefore, coprophagy seemed not to influence the fecal variables analyzed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A study was conducted on 76 Belgian Blue cows. Bacteriology was performed on cotton swab sampled from the visceral and parietal peritoneum of each cow during the CS. Most of samples showed a negative culture (55/76; 72.37%), 19/76 (25%) were positive (p &lt; 0.0001) and two samples were contaminated. In total, 32 isolates belonging to 18 species were identified. Most of them are aerobic (17/18; 94.44%) and half of them were gram-negative (G-). The most encountered bacteria were Acinetobacter sp. (6/32; 18.75%), Pseudomonas sp. (4/32; 12.5%), Aerococcus viridans (4/32; 12.5%), Psychrobacter sp. (3/32; 9.37%), and Escherichia coli (2/32; 6.25%). Among the identified isolates, 31/32 (96.87%) were aerobic and 1/32 (3.12%) was anaerobic (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, 20/32 (62.50%) strains were G&#8722; while 12/32 (37.5%) were gram-positive (G+) (p = 0.012). In fact, most of cultured strains were aerobic G&#8722; (20/32), 11/32 were aerobic G+ and 1/32 is anaerobic G+ (p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, most of samples showed a negative bacteriology; however, aerobic G&#8722; strains were the most identified in positive swabs. Therefore, preoperative antibiotics should be aimed against these bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence and geographical distribution of cystic echinococcosis, and molecular characterization of Echinococcus granulosus s.l. from slaughtered cattle in Romania. In the period 2020&#8722;2021, a total of 2693 cattle (aged 2&#8722;21 years) slaughtered from the breeds Bruna de Maramure&#537;, B&#259;l&#539;at&#259; Rom&#226;neasc&#259;, and a mixed breed were examined to identify hydatid cysts. Cysts were identified in 66 cattle (2.45%). The predominant location of hydatid cysts was the lungs. Most cysts were non-fertile. By age categories, hydatidosis was reported in the age categories 2&#8722;12 years (6/2341; 0.25%), 13&#8722;16 years (11/244; 4.5%), 17&#8722;20 years (41/85; 48.23%), and over 21 years (8/23; 34.78%). Following the PCR analysis of 10 samples from the lungs (protoscoleces/proliferative membrane/hydatid liquid), DNA fragments were identified in 5 samples. Following sequencing, the identified species was Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.). The study results indicate that the disease is still present in several of the investigated regions of Romania, highlighting a potential public health risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548849</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Estrus Detection in a Dairy Herd Using an Electronic Nose by Direct Sampling on the Perineal Region.</Title>	<Abstract>Estrus detection is very important for the profitability of dairy herds. Different automatic systems for estrus detection have been developed over the last decades. Our study aimed to assess the ability of the electronic nose (EN) MENT-EGAS prototype to detect estrus, based on odor release from the perineal headspace in dairy cattle by direct sampling. The study was performed in an Italian dairy farm using 35 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows. The cows were divided into three groups: group I included 10 lactating 5-month pregnant cows, group II included 19 lactating cycling cows, and group III included 6 cows that were artificially inseminated 18 days before the trial. Odors from the perineal headspace were collected using the MENT-EGAS prototype. In group I, odors were collected once a day for 5 consecutive days. In group II, odors were collected twice daily from day 18 until day 1 of the reproductive cycle. In group III, odors were also collected twice daily from the presumable day 18 of gestation until day 22. Principal component analyses (PCA) of the perineal headspace samples were performed. PCA in group I revealed no significant discrimination. PCA in group II revealed clear discrimination between proestrus and estrus, and between estrus and metestrus but no significant discrimination was obtained between proestrus and metestrus. PCA in group III revealed that in four cows the results were similar to group I and in two cows the results were similar to group II. On day 40 of the presumable pregnancy, the ultrasound examination revealed that only the four cows were pregnant and the other two cows were regularly cycling. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that it is possible to accurately detect estrus in dairy cattle from directly collected odor samples using the MENT-EGAS prototype. This represents the first study of estrus detection using an EN detection by direct sampling. EN technologies, such as MENT-EGAS, could be applied in the future in dairy cattle farms as a precise, non-invasive method for estrus detection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To understand the pathogenesis of the G2b PEDV, we examined the resistance of the G2b PEDV to interferon (IFN) and neutralizing antibodies, which are important for controlling PEDV infection. We found that the G2b PEDV showed higher resistance to IFN than G1a PEDV. The G1a PEDV could replicate in IFN-deficient Vero cells, but not in IFN-releasing porcine alveolar macrophages, whereas the G2b PEDV showed similar infectivity in both types of cells. We also found that G2b PEDV was not effectively blocked by neutralizing antibodies, unlike G1a PEDV, suggesting differences in the antigenicity of the two strains. These results provide an understanding of the occurrence of variant PEDV and its pathogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and etiology of polyserositis in a tricky pig herd. The concurrent effect of vaccination for Gl&#228;sser&#8217;s disease was also assessed. A total of 46 sows and 387 piglets were herein investigated, subdivided into three groups based on their immune status (i.e., vaccination of sows and piglets). All the piglets found spontaneously dead between the 2nd and 16th week of age were recorded and necropsied. Whenever polyserositis was diagnosed, biomolecular investigations were carried out to detect the above-mentioned pathogens. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was detected most frequently (n = 23), often as the only causative agent (n = 15), whereas S. suis was observed in 8 cases (6 as the only pathogen). Moreover, Glaesserella parasuis was demonstrated in 6 piglets, always in combination with Mycoplasma hyorhinis and/or Streptococcus suis. Vaccination did not significantly affect mortality rates. Overall, our data indicate that polyserositis is likely caused by an intricate puzzle of pathogens, even when dealing with a small herd and during a short time span. That makes it challenging to achieve the correct diagnosis and to properly manage this health issue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

High-resolution MRI for post-mortem brains and stereology allow for quantitative assessments of the cetacean brain. In this study, we scanned two brains of bottlenose dolphins in a 7-Tesla (7T) MR scanner and assessed the connectivity of the inferior colliculi and ventral cochlear nuclei using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Serial thick sections were investigated stereologically in one of the dolphins to generate rigorous quantitative estimates of identifiable cell types according to their morphology and expression of molecular markers, yielding reliable cell counts with most coefficients of error &lt;10%. Fibronectin immunoreactivity in the dolphin resembled the pattern in a human chronic traumatic encephalopathy brain, suggesting that neurochemical compensation for insults such as hypoxia may constitute a noxious response in humans, while being physiological in dolphins. These data contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the morphological and neurochemical properties of the dolphin brain and highlight a stereological and neuroimaging workflow that may enable quantitative and translational assessment of pathological processes in the dolphin brain in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, its incidence in Republic of Korea remains unknown. In this study, 135 dog fecal samples were collected to determine TTCaV infection status in Republic of Korea. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 13 of 135 (9.6%) dogs tested positive for TTCaV. Three full-length genome sequences (GenBank IDs: MZ503910, MZ503911, and MZ503912) were obtained from the positive specimens. Phylogenetic tree construction and sequence identity, similarity plot, and recombination analyses were performed using these three full-length genomic sequences. Among the three full-length genomes, MZ503912 was determined to be a recombinant virus based on analysis with the reference TTCaV strains. This novel virus strain might have been generated by recombination between TTCaV strain KX827768 discovered in China and MZ503910 discovered in Republic of Korea. This is the first report to determine the incidence, genetic variation, and recombination of TTCaV in dogs in Republic of Korea. Further studies are needed to elucidate TTCaV pathogenesis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there are no reports describing the clinical symptoms related to granulomatous inflammation after the surgical ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus. This report describes the clinical symptoms caused by granulomatous inflammation and subacute pericarditis in a dog that had undergone the surgical closure of a patent ductus arteriosus 2 years previously. Exploratory thoracotomy was performed for subtotal pericardiectomy, and a biopsy was performed to obtain specimens for histopathological examination and culture tests. The clinical symptoms were relieved after surgery. The persistent leukocytosis improved with steroid administration. This case illustrates that the granulomatous inflammatory response associated with silk suture granuloma is a rare postoperative complication of ductal ligation. In such cases, pericardiectomy can help relieve the clinical symptoms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In dogs, FMT has been shown to have positive regulation effects in treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), canine parvovirus (CPV) enteritis, acute diarrhea (AD), and acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS). FMT involves transplanting the functional components of a donor's feces into the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient. The effective components of FMT not only include commensal bacteria, but also include viruses, fungi, bacterial metabolites, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) from the donor feces. By affecting microbiota and regulating host immunity, these components can help the recipient to restore their microbial community, improve their intestinal barrier, and induce anti-inflammation in their intestines, thereby affecting the development of diseases. In addition to the above components, mucin proteins and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) may be functional ingredients in FMT as well. In addition to the abovementioned indications, FMT is also thought to be useful in treating some other diseases in dogs. Consequently, when preparing FMT fecal material, it is important to preserve the functional components involved. Meanwhile, appropriate fecal material delivery methods should be chosen according to the mechanisms these components act by in FMT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Body temperature was lesser in heifers than steers (p &lt; 0.01). There was a sex &#215; time interaction (p = 0.05) for white blood cells where heifers had reduced concentrations compared with steers at &#8722;72 and 0 h but greater concentrations from 36 to 60 h post-MH. Concentrations of neutrophils were lesser in heifers compared to steers from 0 to 4 h, and from 8 to 12 h (p = 0.03). Lymphocytes were greater in heifers compared to steers at 12 h and from 36 to 60 h post-MH (p &lt; 0.01). The neutrophil&#8722;lymphocyte ratio was lesser in heifers compared to steers from 2 to 24 h and at 48 h post-MH (p &lt; 0.01). Monocytes were greater in heifers compared to steers from 24 to 60 h post-MH (p &lt; 0.01), while eosinophils were greater in heifers compared to steers at 48 and 60 h (p &lt; 0.01). Serum IL-4 was lesser in heifers compared to steers at 0 h and from 2 to 72 h post-MH challenge (p = 0.02). Non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were lesser (p &lt; 0.01) in heifers compared to steers from 2 to 4 h post-MH challenge. Urea nitrogen concentrations were greater (p &lt; 0.01) in heifers than steers at 36 h post-MH challenge. Data from this study reveal distinct differences in the acute phase response following a respiratory disease challenge where steers produced an early response, while the response in heifers appeared to be delayed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548858</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Proteomics Evaluation of Semen of Clinically Healthy Beagle-Breed Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The objectives of the present work were to evaluate the semen of dogs by means of proteomics methods and to compare with proteomics results of the blood of the animals, in order to increase available knowledge on the topic and present relevant reference values for semen samples. Semen samples were collected from five Beagle-breed dogs. Reproductive assessment of the animals by means of clinical, ultrasonographic and seminological examinations confirmed their reproductive health. The sperm-rich fraction and the prostatic fraction of semen were processed for proteomics evaluation. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by means of a LTQ Orbitrap Elite system. The technology combines high separation capacity and strong qualitative ability of proteins in biological samples that require deep proteome coverage. Protein classification was performed based on their functional annotations using Gene Ontology (GO). In blood plasma, semen sperm-rich fraction, and semen prostatic fraction, 59, 42 and 43 proteins, respectively, were detected. Two proteins were identified simultaneously in plasma and the semen sperm-rich fraction, 11 proteins in plasma and the semen prostatic fraction, and three proteins in the semen sperm-rich and prostatic fractions. In semen samples, most proteins were related to cell organization and biogenesis, metabolic processes or transport of ions and molecules. Most proteins were located in the cell membrane, the cytosol or the nucleus. Finally, most proteins performed functions related to binding or enzyme regulation. There were no differences between the semen sperm-rich fraction and prostatic fractions in terms of the clustering of proteins. In conclusion, a baseline reference for proteins in the semen of Beagle-breed dogs is provided. These proteins are involved mostly in supporting spermatozoan maturation, survival and motility, enhancing the reproductive performance of male animals. There appears potential for the proteomics examination of semen to become a tool in semen evaluation. This analysis may potentially identify biomarkers for reproductive disorders. This can be particularly useful in stud animals, also given its advantage as a non-invasive method.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

LA particles (LAPs) are made by treating LA with purification processes and high-pressure homogenization (HPH). We found that LAPs treated with HPH with trehalose and emulsifiers had an average particle size of 179 nm, considerably smaller than LAPs without additives. First, we evaluated the adjuvanticity of LAPs using a murine model with ovalbumin antigens, revealing that LAPs, especially in a five-fold concentration, could induce a considerable antibody response compared with other current adjuvants. In poultry vaccination tests using inactivated Newcastle disease virus, LAPs alone could induce a similar antibody response compared to commercial water-in-oil (W/O) adjuvant ISA70, a commercial adjuvant, at weeks 4 and 6; however, they declined faster than ISA70 at weeks 8 and 10. LAPs added to conventional adjuvant materials, such as mineral oil-based O/W emulsions, showed similar adjuvanticity to ISA70. LA-H5-C, composed of carbomer, emulsifiers and trehalose showed no significant body weight change in acute toxicity compared to other adjuvants including ISA70, making formulated LAPs a potential candidate for use as a veterinary vaccine adjuvant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During physical examination, the calf could stand if assisted when lifting by the tail but fallen to the ground when trying to walk. Attempts to flex and extend the neck to the right side failed. Radiographs findings consisted of reduced intervertebral spaces, and misalignments between the endplates, more evident between the C3 and C4 vertebrae, resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord. Grossly, C4 showed cranial articular surface malformation, abnormal metaphyseal growth plate development, reduced vertebral body size and deformity. Histologically, C4 showed an abnormal vertebral bone development characterized by moderate replacement of trabecular bone by fibrous tissues, multifocal areas of dystrophic hyaline cartilage development, and cartilaginous growth failure along the metaphyseal growth plate. Cervical spinal cord within the stenotic vertebral canal showed swollen neurons with central chromatolysis, areas of Wallerian degeneration, and necrotic debris. In contrast with the well-known Wobbler syndrome in horses, the etiology of CVSM in cattle remains undetermined, and further genetic and pathological studies must be conducted to elucidate it.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

When threatened, it defends itself by erecting its quills, rattling its tail, and running sideways or backyard into predators. The quills are released upon contact with assailants and tend to migrate into several body tissues or cavities due to the unique inverted cuticles (crenate) directed downwards to the quill base (a sort of "harpoon effect"). Intracardiac migration of porcupine quills has been reported in a few dogs with severe clinical signs. This case report describes a single porcupine quill [Hystrix cristata, (HC)] migration through the heart in a dog and the use of multimodality imaging for the diagnosis and surgical approach. A 4-year-old 25 kg female mixed-breed dog was presented for evaluation of recurrent fever. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed a linear, hyperechoic foreign body traversing the interventricular septum from the heart base to the cardiac apex. Computed tomography and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of a single structure resembling a quill; a later esophageal endoscopy showed no anatomical alterations or mucosal injuries. Following median sternotomy and after accurate localization by intraoperative ultrasound, the quill was successfully removed. The dog had a good recovery without evidence of severe cardiac injury secondary to an intracardiac quill. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the identification of an intracardiac HC quill by ultrasonography and CT and its successful removal by ultrasound guide has not been previously reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite being an established industry, production issues stemming from disease outbreaks remain problematic for producers. Supplementing fish diets with probiotics to enhance the immune system and growth potential is one approach to mitigating disease. Although considerable laboratory data demonstrate efficacy, these results do not always translate to natural modes of disease transmission. Hence, the present work was conducted in the laboratory but incorporated flow-through water from large catfish pond production systems, allowing for natural exposure to pathogens. Two feeding trials were conducted in an 18-tank aquaria system housing two different sizes, 34.8 &#177; 12.5 g and 0.36 &#177; 0.03 g, of channel catfish. Channel catfish in the first trial were fed three experimental diets over six weeks. Commercial diets were top-coated with two selected spore-forming Bacillus spp. probiotics, Bacillus velezensis AP193 (1 &#215; 106 CFU g&#8722;1) and BiOWiSH (3.6 &#215; 104 CFU g&#8722;1), or a basal diet that contained no dietary additive. In the second eight-week trial, diets were top-coated with BiOWiSH at three concentrations (1.8, 3.6, and 7.3 &#215; 104 CFU g&#8722;1), along with one basal diet (no probiotic). At the completion of these studies, growth performance, survival, hematocrit, blood chemistry, and immune expression of interleukin 1&#946; (il1&#946;), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-&#945;), interleukin-8 (il8), transforming-growth factor &#946;1 (tgf-&#946;1), and toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) were evaluated using qPCR. Trial results revealed no differences (p &gt; 0.05) among treatments concerning growth, survival, or hematological parameters. For immune gene expression, interesting trends were discerned, with substantial downregulation observed in B. velezensis AP193-fed fish for il1&#946;, tnf-&#945;, and tlr9 expression within splenic tissue, compared to that of the basal and BiOWiSH diets (p &lt; 0.05). However, the results were not statistically significant for anterior kidney tissue in the first trial. In the second trial, varied levels of probiotic inclusion revealed no significant impact of BiOWiSH&#8217;s products on the expression of il1&#946;, tnf-&#945;, il8, and tgf-&#946;1 in both spleen and kidney tissue at any rate of probiotic inclusion (p &gt; 0.05). Based on these findings, more research on utilizing probiotics in flow-through systems with natural infection conditions is crucial to ensure consistency from a controlled laboratory scale to real-world practices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report describes a case of ovarian leiomyoma in a 22-year-old white tiger (Panthera tiger), treated with deslorelin implants, detailing pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Gross examination revealed a markedly enlarged, firm, whitish right ovary with a multinodular appearance. On a cut surface, multiple brown-fluid-filled cysts interspersed with solid grey-to-white areas were observed. On histopathological examination, the ovary was enlarged and replaced by a densely cellular neoplasm composed of spindle cells arranged in fascicles, or occasionally in a herringbone pattern, embedded in a large stroma of collagenous connective tissue. Neoplastic cells showed mild nuclear atypia and pleomorphism and low mitotic rate. Immunohistochemistry confirmed smooth muscle origin of the neoplasm, and cells were positive for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and caldesmon. A low rate (&lt;1%) of Ki-67-positive cells was observed. Although rare, ovarian leiomyoma should be considered when a mass is present in the ovary of a tiger with reproductive failure. Because cancer of the reproductive system impacts on species conservation by affecting reproduction, regular health monitoring is warranted to support wildlife conservation. Finally, the adverse effects associated with long-term treatment with synthetic GnRH analogues as contraceptives in non-domestic felids are worthy of future investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Radiation therapy is often used to treat mammary tumors that target DNA lesions. RAD51 is a key molecule that repairs DNA damage via homologous recombination. We examined the relationship between RAD51 expression and radiosensitivity in mammary tumor cell lines. CHMp and CHMm from the same individual were selected based on the differences in RAD51 expression. The radiosensitivity of both cell lines was examined using MTT and scratch assays; CHMm, which has high RAD51 expression, showed higher sensitivity to radiation than CHMp. However, the nuclear focus of RAD51 during DNA repair was formed normally in CHMp, but not in most of CHMm. Since irradiation resulted in the suppression of cell cycle progression in CHMp, the expression of p21, a cell cycle regulatory factor, was detected in CHMp after 15 Gy irradiation but not in CHMm. These results indicate that functional expression is more important than the quantitative expression of RAD51 in canine mammary tumor cells in response to DNA damage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548865</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Activin A Reduces Porcine Granulosa Cells Apoptosis via ER&#946;-Dependent ROS Modulation.</Title>	<Abstract>Unfavorable conditions compromise animal reproduction by altering the ovarian granulosa cells' follicular dynamics and normal physiological function (GCs), eventually resulting in oxidative damage and cell apoptosis. Activin is produced in the GCs and plays a vital role in folliculogenesis. This study investigated the effects of activin A (ACT-A) treatment in vitro on the apoptosis of porcine GCs and the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that ACT-A could attenuate the apoptosis of the GCs and enhance the synthesis of estrogen (E2). ACT-A also enhanced FSH-induced estrogen receptor-&#946; (ER&#946;) expression, inhibiting ER&#946; aggravated intracellular accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. The E2 levels in the culture medium, the mRNA expression pattern of the apoptosis-related genes (CASPASE 3, BCL2, and BAX), steroidogenesis-related gene (CYP19A1), and cell viability were analyzed to confirm the results. In summary, this study indicated the protective role of ACT-A in apoptosis by attenuating the ROS accumulation through ER&#946;. These results aim to enhance the follicular functions and improve animal reproductive performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36548866</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Antibiotic-Resistant Escherichia coli Strains Isolated from Captive Giant Pandas: A Reservoir of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Virulence-Associated Genes.</Title>	<Abstract>Recent studies showed that Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains isolated from captive giant pandas have serious resistance to antibiotics and carry various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs or virulence-associated genes (VAGs) carried by antibiotic-resistant E. coli are considered as a potential health threat to giant pandas, humans, other animals and the environment. In this study, we screened ARGs and VAGs in 84 antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains isolated from clinically healthy captive giant pandas, identified the association between ARGs and VAGs and analyzed the phylogenetic clustering of E. coli isolates. Our results showed that the most prevalent ARG in E. coli strains isolated from giant pandas is blaTEM (100.00%, 84/84), while the most prevalent VAG is fimC (91.67%, 77/84). There was a significant positive association among 30 pairs of ARGs, of which the strongest was observed for sul1/tetC (OR, 133.33). A significant positive association was demonstrated among 14 pairs of VAGs, and the strongest was observed for fyuA/iroN (OR, 294.40). A positive association was also observed among 45 pairs of ARGs and VAGs, of which the strongest was sul1/eaeA (OR, 23.06). The association of ARGs and mobile gene elements (MGEs) was further analyzed, and the strongest was found for flor and intI1 (OR, 79.86). The result of phylogenetic clustering showed that the most prevalent group was group B2 (67.86%, 57/84), followed by group A (16.67%, 14/84), group D (9.52%, 8/84) and group B1 (5.95%, 5/84). This study implied that antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolated from captive giant pandas is a reservoir of ARGs and VAGs, and significant associations exist among ARGs, VAGs and MGEs. Monitoring ARGs, VAGs and MGEs carried by E. coli from giant pandas is beneficial for controlling the development of antimicrobial resistance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Exosomes are phospholipid bilayer vesicles that are widely distributed in living organisms and released by the cells of various organs and tissues. Exosomes contain proteins, RNA, lipids, and other components and are important carriers of information transfer between cells, which play a variety of physiological and pathological regulatory functions. More and more studies have found that exosomes and their connotations play an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of diseases. A systematic review was conducted in this manuscript and then highlights our knowledge about the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of exosomes to reproductive diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, premature ovarian failure (POF), preeclampsia, polycystic, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate gland cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As a result, NST are often diagnosed as STT, a broad category that encompasses various entities including perivascular wall tumors (PWT) and that represents approximately 15% of all skin tumors in dogs. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can assist the identification of histologic subtypes of STT. This IHC pilot study applies various markers largely expressed by peripheral nerves to twelve benign and six malignant NST and determines the intratumoral protein expression of laminin, periaxin-1, Sox-10 and S-100 in the NST subtypes. Furthermore, this study assesses the usefulness of peripheral nerve markers applied to diagnostic work cases and demonstrates the relevance of laminin expression patterns, periaxin-1 and Sox-10 in assisting the differentiation of NST from other STT, in particular from PWT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669003</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Physiotherapeutic Strategies and Their Current Evidence for Canine Osteoarthritis.</Title>	<Abstract>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and debilitating condition in domestic dogs. Alongside pharmaceutical interventions and weight loss, exercise and physiotherapy (PT) are important measures in maintaining patient mobility and quality of life. Physiotherapy for OA aims to reduce pain, optimize muscular function and maintain joint function. Physiotherapeutic plans typically include PT exercises combined with therapeutic modalities, lifestyle and environmental modifications to improve the patient's overall quality of life and function. Information on therapeutic clinical efficacy of physiotherapeutic measures for canine OA is still very limited. Thus, physiotherapeutic strategies are still primarily based on evidence extrapolated from human protocols tailored to people with OA. The authors propose a simple systematic PT approach for canine OA, prioritizing measures according to simplicity, cost effectiveness and practicality. This guide (the "Physiotherapy Pyramid") aims to provide a clear stratified approach to simplify decision making and planning for owners, veterinarians and veterinary physiotherapists, leading to more straightforward design and implementation of treatment plans. Measures are implemented starting at the base of the pyramid, subsequently progressing to the top, allowing effective and practical interventions to be prioritized. The levels of the pyramid are in ascending order: environmental modification, exercise plan, OA-specific home exercises and treatment by a veterinary physiotherapist.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to find the genomic regions that best differentiate and characterise Italian LGD and HSD. Genomic data of 158 dogs of four LGD and five HSD breeds, obtained with the 170K canine SNPchip, were collected. The two groups were compared using FST and XP-EHH analyses, identifying regions containing 29 genes. Moreover, 16 islands of runs of homozygosity were found in LGD, and 15 in HSD; 4 of them were partially shared. Among the genes found that better differentiated HSD and LGD, several were associated with dog domestication and behavioural aspects; particularly, MSRB3 and LLPH were linked to herding behaviour in previous studies. Others, DYSK, MAP2K5, and RYR, were related to body size and muscle development. Prick ears prevailed in sampled HSD, and drop ears in LGD; this explains the identification of WIF1 and MSRB3 genes. Unexpectedly, a number of genes were also associated with eye development and functionality. These results shed further light on the differences that human selection introduced in dogs aimed at different duties, even in a limited geographic area such as Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The clinical stage is one of the well-known prognostic factors for canine oral melanoma. However, the factors that directly affect the response to RT have remained unclear. This study aimed to validate the risk factors for recurrence after RT. Sixty-eight dogs with oral melanomas were included in this study. All dogs were treated with palliative RT using a linear accelerator without adjuvant therapies. After RT, the time to local recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the log-rank test. As a result, clinical stage and response to therapy were the significant independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. The presence of local bone lysis and non-combination with cytoreductive surgery were associated with a worse response to RT. Immunohistochemical analysis for hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; indicated that tumor cells invading the bone are under hypoxic conditions, which may explain a poorer efficiency of RT in dogs with bone lysis. In conclusion, clinical stage and combination with debulking surgery were needed to improve the efficiency of RT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the anatomy and physiology of the avian eye substantially differ from those in mammals, and pharmacokinetic data substantiating the clinical efficacy of enrofloxacin in birds are still lacking. In total, 40 chickens (Gallus gallus, Lohman Selected Leghorn) received single intramuscular administration of enrofloxacin at a dosage of 25 mg/kg body weight (BW). Serial blood and aqueous humour samples were taken at 12 different time points after administration (0-60 min and 2-32 h) and were analysed for their fluoroquinolone concentrations using a competitive enzyme immunoassay. The metabolization of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin was determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The maximum serum concentrations of fluoroquinolones were observed at the time point of 2.82 &#177; 0.1 h and amounted to 10.67 &#177; 0.5 &#181;g/mL. Fluoroquinolones redistributed to a minor extent into the aqueous humour reaching maximum concentrations of 4.52 &#177; 1.2 &#181;g/mL after 7.54 &#177; 1.0 h of drug administration. The mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (Vd), and terminal half-life (t1/2 &#223;) were 1.68-, 2.84-, and 2.01-fold higher in aqueous humour than in serum, indicating that fluoroquinolones were trapped in aqueous humour. Enrofloxacin was only marginally metabolized into ciprofloxacin. A single intramuscular injection of a therapeutical dose of enrofloxacin (25 mg/kg BW) thus generated sustained and therapeutically active levels of enrofloxacin in the aqueous humour of chicken eyes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669007</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Malformation of the Cortical Development Associated with Severe Clusters of Epileptic Seizures.</Title>	<Abstract>Three cases of the malformation of the cortical development are described: a mixed breed dog and a Border Collie pup with a focal and diffuse cortical dysplasia, respectively, and a kitten with lissencephaly. All cases presented with intractable epilepsy and were euthanized, due to the cluster of epileptic seizures. The gross examination at necropsy revealed the morphologic alteration of the telencephalic region in two cases. Histopathologically, a disorganization of the cortical lamination with the presence of megalic neurons, was found in the focal cortical dysplasia case. An altered organization of the white and gray matter, with a loss of the normal neuronal distribution and altered neurons, characterized the diffuse cortical dysplasia case. In the lissencephalic cat, there was no recognizable organization of the brain with areas of neuroglial tissue forming nodules in the leptomeningeal space. We strongly support the hypothesis that, as in humans, as well as in the veterinary patients, malformations of the cortical development could be the cause of refractory epilepsy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669008</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Whole Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Cats and Dogs in South Korea in 2021.</Title>	<Abstract>SARS-CoV-2 infections have caused unprecedented damage worldwide by affecting humans and various animals. The first reported animal infection was observed in a pet dog in Hong Kong in March 2020. 36 countries reported 692 SARS-CoV-2 infections in 25 different animal species by 31 August 2022. Most outbreaks were caused by contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected humans. In South Korea, the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in an animal was reported in a cat in February 2021. As of 31 December 2021, 74 dogs and 42 cats have been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea. Here, we identified various SARS-CoV-2 genomic lineages in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cats and dogs. Among the 40 animal samples sequenced for lineage identification, a total of eight Pango lineages (B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant), B.1.429 (Epsilon variant), B.1.470, B.1.497, B.1.619.1, B.1.620, AY.69 (Delta variant), and AY.122.5 (Delta variant)) were identified. The dominant lineages were AY.69 (Delta variant; 37.5%), B.1.497 (35.0%), and B.1.619.1 (12.5%). This study provides the first reported cases of six lineages (B.1.470, B.1.497, B.1.620, B.1.619.1, AY.69 (Delta variant)), and AY.122.5 (Delta variant) in cats and dogs. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in pets because they are dynamic hosts of variant Pango lineages of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A red-brown 3 cm x 4 cm neoplastic mass was identified within the body of the pancreas, along with multiple similar nodular structures within the omentum and liver. Associated lesions included hemoperitoneum, yellow discoloration of the peritoneal wall, and severe anemia. Spindle-shaped neoplastic cells exhibiting malignancy features, which occasionally contained within the cytoplasm haematoidin crystals and/or red blood cells, were observed during cytological examination. Histologically, the neoplastic cells were organized in short streams forming vascular spaces filled with erythrocytes. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were immunolabeled for vimentin and CD31, supporting the diagnosis of hemangiosarcoma. This report offers a complete post-mortem and histological evaluation of a rare tumor in cats with an unusual location and a comparative assessment of 3 anti-CD31 antibodies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669010</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Investigating Visual Monitoring of the Scrotum as a Supplementary Tool for Boar Semen Quality Evaluation.</Title>	<Abstract>Farm animals behavior research uses video cameras, mainly for visual observation and recording. The purpose of this feasibility study was to enrich the predictable methods of boar semen production capacity by correlating sperm variables with the scrotal contractions (SC) frequency and intensity. A video camera was used to record the reaction of the scrotum during ejaculation. The respective collected ejaculates were evaluated and semen parameters, such as viability, morphology, membranes functional integrity and kinematics, were determined. The camera recorded the scrotal contractions/relaxations and the video was handled by the Image Processing Toolbox of Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The SC intensity was verified as a percentage change in the scrotum size among the video frames of maximum contraction and relaxation. The archived data from the frames were analyzed statistically, using a linear mixed effects model that involved sperm assessed parameters. Correlations of the SC intensity with the average path velocity, VAP (R[2] = 0.591, p = 0.043) and with the percentage of the cytoplasmic droplets (R[2] = 0.509, p = 0.036) were noticed. Previous studies reported the positive correlation of VAP with the number of live-born piglets. In conclusion, video monitoring of the boar scrotal function during ejaculation is useful, but more research is needed to establish its appropriateness as a supplementary method for the prognosis of boar ability to produce high-quality semen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669011</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Maternal Behavior in Beef Cattle: The Physiology, Assessment and Future Directions-A Review.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine maternal behavior is known to be influenced by a variety of factors including hormonal mediation, breed, age, parity, host genetics and general management practices. Following centuries of varying levels of domestication processes, the behavior of the bovine cow has altered from that of her original wild ungulate ancestors, although many maternal instincts have remained unchanged. The influence of maternal behavior on calf health and performance is of interest to cow-calf beef production operations, as in most instances, the cow is solely responsible for rearing the calf until weaning. However, investigating the magnitude of this influence is challenging, in part because objective measurement of behavioral traits is difficult, particularly in extensive settings. In recent years, while a number of remote monitoring devices have been developed that afford opportunities for objective measurement of behavioral traits in livestock, characterization of physiological mechanisms that underlie superior maternal behavior, including identification of potential biomarkers remains elusive in cattle. Hormonal profiles during the periparturient period have been shown to influence behavioral patterns in both current and future generations in other mammalian species and may provide insights into the physiology of bovine maternal behavior. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe general characteristics of bovine maternal behavior and the factors known to influence it, including hormonal drivers, through which cross-reference to other species is made. Current methods of measuring and assessing behavior that may also be applicable to most production settings have also been reviewed. At present, there is no known hormonal assay that can be used to measure and/or reliably predict bovine maternal behavior post-calving or across generations. Being able to objectively assess superior maternal behavior, whether that be through remote monitoring, hormonal profiling or indirectly through measuring calf performance will be beneficial to livestock industries in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669012</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic Comparisons of Body Weight, Average Daily Gain, and Breast Circumference between Slow-Growing Thai Native Chickens (Pradu Hang dum) Raised On-Site Farm and On-Station.</Title>	<Abstract>To ensure that any new technology developed within an experimental station is appropriate to the community&#8217;s needs and compatible with the existing systems, on-site farm research is an important component in examining the effectiveness of agricultural research. The present study examined the growth performance and genetics of Thai native chickens under conditions typically experienced by farmers on smallholder farms (on-site farms) compared with at an experimental unit (on-station). There were 1694 Thai native chickens (Pradu Hang dum) used in this experiment, and they were divided into 613 chickens for the on-station and 1081 chickens for the on-site farm experiments. The individual chicken data included the birth weight (BW0) and body weight at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age (BW4, BW8, BW12, and BW16, respectively), ADG from 0&#8722;4, 4&#8722;8, 8&#8722;12, 12&#8722;16 weeks of age (ADG0&#8722;4, ADG4&#8722;8, ADG8&#8722;12, ADG12&#8722;16, respectively), and breast circumference at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age (BrC8, BrC12, BrC16, respectively). A multiple traits animal model and a selection index were used to estimate the variance components, genetic parameters, and breeding values of growth traits. The results showed that the body weight, average daily gain, and breast circumference at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age of Thai native chickens raised on-station were higher than those raised on-site at the farm among mixed-sex and sex-segregated chickens, while the birth weight and body weight at four weeks of age (BW0 and BW4) and ADG from 0&#8722;4 weeks of age (ADG0&#8722;4) were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). The heritability estimates of body weight, average daily gain, and breast circumference in the chickens raised at the on-site farm and on-station were moderate to high, with on-station values slightly higher than on-site farm values. The heritability estimates of body weight were 0.236 to 0.499 for the on-site farm, and 0.291 to 0.499 for on-station. For average daily gain, the heritability estimates were 0.274 to 0.283 for the on-site farm and 0.298 to 0.313 for on-station; meanwhile, and for breast circumference, the heritability estimates were 0.204 to 0.268 for the on-site farm and 0.278 to 0.296 for on-station. Both phenotypic and genetic correlations among and between growth traits were positive and ranged from low to high values. The top 20% of the estimated breeding values and selection indices in the on-site farm and on-station experiments showed that the body weight at eight weeks of age (BW8), ADG from 4&#8722;8 weeks of age (ADG4&#8722;8), and breast circumference at eight weeks of age (BrC8) should be used as selection criteria for Thai native chicken breeding programs. In conclusion, the genetic parameters and breeding values in on-station experiments showed that the breeding program by selection index for improving growth performance is valid. Therefore, to implement such a breeding program in an on-site farm, an intensive or semi-intensive farm system should be considered to minimize the effect of genotype-environment interaction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The commercial PRRSV-inactivated vaccine (CH-1a strain) in China was recently selected to control PRRS in large populations of PRRS-positive sows and was found to effectively reduce the rate of stillbirth abortion based on clinical observations. However, stress from vaccine inoculation (e.g., fever, anorexia, abortions, and slow body weight gain) usually appears after immunization on many swine farms. In this study, we fed piglets a diet medicated with tylvalosin tartrate during PRRSV-inactivated vaccine immunization. We found that tylvalosin tartrate attenuated the increase in total white blood cells induced by immunization at day one post-immunization (DPI) and induced an increase in monocyte counts after seven DPI. There was also attenuation in the intensity of the inflammatory response induced by vaccination and elevation of serum IFN-&#947; concentrations at three and seven DPI after immunization. The administration of tylvalosin tartrate could also attenuate the reduction in the percentage of CD8[+] T cells induced by PRRSV-inactivated vaccine immunization at seven DPI. These results demonstrated that in addition to tylvalosin tartrate being able to control respiratory and enteric bacterial infections in swine farms, it can also improve the stress status of swine herds during PRRSV-inactivated vaccine immunization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although a validated biomarker of omega-3 status in humans, little is known about the O3I status of dogs and cats; species in which omega-3 fatty acids have known health benefits. The purpose of this study was to develop equations to predict the O3I in these species from a dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. Random blood samples from 33 dogs and 10 cats were obtained from a community veterinary clinic. DBS and RBC samples were analyzed for fatty acid composition. For both species, the R2 between the DBS EPA + DHA value and the O3I was &gt;0.96 (p &lt; 0.001). The O3I was roughly 75% lower in dogs and cats than in humans. We conclude that the O3I can be estimated from a DBS sample, and the convenience of DBS collection should facilitate omega-3 research in these companion animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Coinfection with multiple pathogens is not rare among clinical infectious cases. Rapid diagnosis of these coinfections is of great significance for timely and effective clinical treatment. In this study, two novel multiplex polymerase chain reactions (mPCRs) were established for simultaneous detection of four pathogens associated with the feline intestinal tract (feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline astrovirus (FeAstV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV)) and five pathogens associated with the respiratory tract (feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), Chlamydia felis (C. felis) and influenza A virus (IAV)). The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that the detection limits for FeKoV, FPV, FeAstV, FCoV, IAV, C. felis, FeLV, FHV-1 and FCV were 10[3], 10[4], 10[3], 10[3], 10[3], 10[4], 10[4], 10[5] and 10[5] copies/&#181;L, respectively. Moreover, the specificity of the two mPCRs was high. When the two mPCRs were applied to clinical samples, the assay worked well. In conclusion, we established two mPCR methods that provide an excellent tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of pathogens associated with the feline respiratory and intestinal tracts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Five dietary treatments with sprouted barley (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) and nine replicates per dietary treatment were performed on forty-five Awassi lambs (90 days old). The average weight gain, intake, and digestibility of dry and organic matter were recorded. The pH, color, volatile fatty acids, bacterial quantification, and rumen histomorphometry were also determined. The results showed that the average dry and organic matter intake in T2 to T4 and the average weight gain in T4 decreased linearly. In contrast, the digestibility of dry and organic matter by sprouted barley (T2 to T4) was higher. The pH values and rumen color were not affected. Concentrations of formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and the ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid were increased, while lactic acid and total volatile fatty acids were lower in all levels of sprouted barley. In addition, lambs fed T4 had a higher quantification of Anaerovibrio Lipolytica, Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, and Streptococcus Bovis quantification. Selenomonas Ruminantium was higher in T1, T2, and T4, whereas Megashpaera Elsdenii was lower in T1 to T3. The rumen histomorphometric was improved by sprouted barley (T2 and T3). Sprouted barley improved digestibility and rumen histomorphometry and increased the concentration of some volatile fatty acids and rumen bacteria but resulted in a decrease in average dry and organic matter intake, which negatively affected weight gain in lambs fed 100 % sprouted barley. Further studies are required to determine the potential effects on growing lambs fed sprouted barley.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was carried out with interspecific SCNT technology to clone the Arabian Oryx utilizing the oryx's fibroblast cells and transfer it to the enucleated oocytes of a domestic cow. The recipient oocytes were extracted from the cows that had been butchered. Oryx somatic nuclei were introduced into cow oocytes to produce embryonic cells. The study was conducted on three groups, Oryx interspecific somatic cell nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of domestic cows, cow SCNT "the same bovine family species", used as a control group, and in vitro fertilized (IVF) cows to verify all media used in this work. The rates of different embryo developmental stages varied slightly (from 1- cell to morula stage). Additionally, the oryx interspecies Somatic cell nuclear transfer blastocyst developmental rate (9.23%) was comparable to that of cow SCNT (8.33%). While the blastula stage rate of the (IVF) cow embryos exhibited a higher cleavage rate (42%) in the embryo development stage. The results of this study enhanced domestic cow oocytes' ability to support interspecific SCNT cloned oryx, and generate a viable embryo that can advance to the blastula stage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent experimental challenge studies in three-week-old nursery pigs failed to cause disease. However, it remains unclear how genetic differences contribute to viral pathogenesis. To characterize the pathogenesis of different PPIV1 isolates, three-week-old nursery pigs were challenged with either PPIV1 isolate USA/MN25890NS/2016 (MN16) or USA/IA84915LG/2017 (IA17). A human parainfluenza virus 1 (HPIV1) strain C35 ATCC[&#174;] VR-94&#8482; was included to evaluate swine as a model for human parainfluenza. All viruses were successfully re-isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and detected by RT-qPCR at necropsy. Microscopic lung lesions were more severe in the IA17 group compared to the non-challenged negative control (Ctrl) group whereas differences were not found between the MN16 and Ctrl groups. Immunohistochemistry staining in respiratory samples showed a consistent trend of higher levels of PPIV1 signal in the IA17 group followed by the MN16 group, and no PPIV1 signal observed in the HPIV1 or Ctrl groups. This study suggests potential pathogenesis differences between PPIV1 isolates. Additionally, these results indicate that HPIV1 is capable of replicating in nursery pigs after experimental inoculation. However, clinical disease or gross lung lesions were not observed in any of the challenge groups.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The new results represented a motivation for investigators in specific fields of veterinary medicine, who addressed the same research topics from different perspectives in studies based on experimental and spontaneous animal disease models. The study of different pheno-genotypic contexts contributes to the confirmation of translational models of pathologic mechanisms. This review provides an overview of EMT and MET processes in both human and canine species. While human medicine rapidly advances, having a large amount of information available, veterinary medicine is not at the same level. This situation should provide motivation for the veterinary medicine research field, to apply the knowledge on humans to research in pets. By merging the knowledge of these two disciplines, better and faster results can be achieved, thus improving human and canine health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669021</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Ehrlichiosis in Dogs: A Comprehensive Review about the Pathogen and Its Vectors with Emphasis on South and East Asian Countries.</Title>	<Abstract>Ehrlichiosis in dogs is an emerging vector borne rickettsial zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution. In general, three Ehrlichial species (Ehrlichia canis, E. ewingii, and E. chaffeensis) are involved in infecting dogs. Among them, E. canis is the well-known etiological pathogen affecting platelets, monocytes, and granulocytes. Dogs act as a reservoir, while the main vector responsible for disease transmission is Rhipicephalus sanguineus. However, in east Asian countries, Haemaphysalis longicornis is considered the principal vector for disease transmission. This disease affects multiple organs and systems and has three clinical manifestations, including acute, subclinical, and chronic. Definitive diagnosis involves visualization of morulae on cytology, detection of antibodies through an indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT), and DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In canine ehrlichiosis, no predilection of age or sex is observed; however, Siberian Huskies and German Shepherds are more likely to develop severe clinical manifestations. Doxycycline, rifampicin, and minocycline are proven to be effective drugs against canine ehrlichiosis. This review is intended to describe a brief overview of Ehrlichia infection in dogs, its reported prevalence in east and south Asian countries, and the latest knowledge regarding chemotherapy and associated vectors responsible for the disease transmission. This manuscript also identifies the prevailing knowledge gaps which merit further attention by the scientific community.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to determine if vaccination before the complete absorption of colostral antibodies results in adequate immune priming and clinical protection of beef calves. Within 6 h of life, calves were randomly assigned to 2 different treatment groups. Group Vacc (n = 25) received a single dose of a modified-live virus (MLV) BRSV vaccine intranasally (IN) and group Control (n = 25) received 2 mL of 0.9% saline IN. At approximately 3 months of age, all calves were experimentally challenged with BRSV. Serum and nasal secretion samples were collected before and after challenge for BRSV real-time RT-PCR and antibody testing. Respiratory signs were not observed before challenge. After challenge, respiratory scores were similar between groups. On the challenge day, &gt;40% of calves in each group were febrile. The mean serum and nasal BRSV-specific antibody titers indicated natural BRSV exposure before the experimental challenge in both groups. All calves tested positive for BRSV and had a similar duration of shedding after challenge. Based on these results, vaccination at birth does not offer advantages for immune priming or clinical protection for beef calves in BRSV-endemic cow-calf herds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669023</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effects of Continuous LPS Induction on Oxidative Stress and Liver Injury in Weaned Piglets.</Title>	<Abstract>Due to imperfections in their immune and digestive systems, weaned piglets are susceptible to invasions of the external environment and diseases, especially bacterial infections, which lead to slow growth, tissue damage, and even the death of piglets. Here, a model of weaned piglets induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was established to explore the effects of continuous low-dose LPS induction on the mechanism of liver injury. A total of forty-eight healthy 28-day-old weaned piglets (weight = 6.65 &#177; 1.19 kg) were randomly divided into two groups: the CON group and LPS group. During the experimental period of thirteen days, the LPS group was injected intraperitoneally with LPS (100 &#956;g/kg) once per day, and the CON group was treated with the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution. On the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th days, the serum and liver of the piglets were collected for the determination of serum biochemical indexes, an antioxidant capacity evaluation, and histopathological examinations. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of the TLR4 pathway and inflammatory cytokines were detected. The results showed that the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the serum increased after LPS induction. The activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the serum and liver homogenate of the LPS group were lower than those of the CON group, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver of the LPS group were higher than those in the CON group. At the same time, morphological impairment of the livers occurred, including hepatocyte caryolysis, hepatocyte vacuolization, karyopycnosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration, and the mRNA expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-&#954;B, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-10 were upregulated in the livers after LPS induction. The above results were more obvious on the 1st and 5th days of LPS induction, while the trend during the later period was not significant. It was concluded that the oxidative stress and liver injury occurred at the early stage of LPS induction, while the liver damage weakened at the later stage. The weaned piglets probably gradually developed tolerance to the endotoxin after the continuous low-dose induction of LPS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thoracic radiographs showed pectus excavatum, enlarged cardiac silhouette, and generalized interstitial patterns. Echocardiography revealed normal left atrial (LA) and left ventricular dimensions. A large tubular structure, suspected to be a distended pulmonary vein (PV), was identified as draining into the LA. Severe eccentric and concentric right ventricular hypertrophy and paradoxical septal motion were noted. Based on Doppler echocardiography, both pulmonary venous and pulmonary artery pressure was severely elevated. Clinical, radiographic, and echocardiographic abnormalities were hypothesized to result from pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), causing severely elevated pulmonary venous pressures and resulting in clinical signs of left-sided congestive heart failure (L-CHF) and severe post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (Pc-PH). The prognosis for good quality of life was assessed as poor, and the owner elected euthanasia. Necropsy confirmed the presence of PVS with severe dilation of the PVs draining all but the left cranial lung lobe. All lung lobes except the left cranial lobe had increased tissue density and a mottled cut surface. This case report shows that, in rare cases, both L-CHF and Pc-PH may be present without LA enlargement. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on PVS in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 3-year-old Shetland sheepdog was presented with a history of slowly progressive lethargy, vision impairment and cognitive deficits. On magnetic resonance imaging, a subdural fluid accumulation (SFA) overlying and compressing the left parietotemporal lobe as well as multifocal changes consisting of cyst-like lesions, supposed intra-axial brain lesions and mild, multifocal meningeal thickening and generalized contrast enhancement were identified. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a mononuclear pleocytosis with negative results for infectious agents. The dog was treated with prednisolone followed by burr hole craniotomy with puncture of the SFA, which macroscopically appeared to be CSF-like fluid. After initial improvement, the dog deteriorated despite continuation of prednisolone and cytarabine therapy and was euthanized four weeks after surgery. Histopathology was consistent with a disseminated, neuroinvasive choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) that involved the entire neuroaxis including the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. Immunohistochemical examination showed a strong Kir7.1 and a heterogenous cytokeratin-immunoreactivity in neoplastic cells. In conclusion, a CPC should be considered as a possible cause of a SFA even in the absence of an intraventricular mass lesion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, lectin-binding patterns in nephron segments of feline kidneys have not been fully surveyed. The present study reported lectin-binding patterns in normal feline kidneys by histochemical investigations of eight commercially available lectin detection kits. Kidneys from four normal cats (intact males, 23-27 months old) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin; lectin histochemistry was performed for WGA, s-WGA, RCA-I, ConA, PNA, SBA, DBA, and UEA-I lectins. WGA, RCA, and ConA binding was observed from Bowman's capsule to the collecting ducts, while only WGA was detected in the glomerular capillary. s-WGA was observed from the proximal tubules to the collecting ducts, showing discriminative heterogeneous binding. PNA and SBA were detected in the distal nephrons, such as the thin limbs of the loops of Henle, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. UEA-I binding was observed in the thick ascending limbs of the loops of Henle, especially in the macula densa regions. DBA lectin showed no positive labeling in nephrons. The observed binding patterns may prove beneficial for the analysis of changes in glycosylation in feline kidney diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Since evidence links dysbiosis to mucosal inflammation, probiotics, prebiotics, or their combination (synbiotics) may reduce intestinal inflammation and ameliorate dysbiosis in affected dogs. This study's aim was to investigate the effects of the synbiotic-IgY supplement on clinical signs, inflammatory indices, and mucosal microbiota in dogs with CE. Dogs with CE were enrolled in a randomized prospective trial. Twenty-four client-owned dogs were fed a hydrolyzed diet and administered supplement or placebo (diet) for 6 weeks. Dogs were evaluated at diagnosis and 2- and 6-week post-treatment. Outcome measures included clinical activity, endoscopic and histologic scores, inflammatory markers (fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein), and composition of the mucosal microbiota via FISH. Eleven supplement- and nine placebo-treated dogs completed the trial. After 6 weeks of therapy, clinical activity and endoscopic scores decreased in both groups. Compared to placebo-treated dogs, dogs administered supplement showed decreased calprotectin at 2-week post-treatment, decreased CRP at 2- and 6-week post-treatment increased mucosal Clostridia and Bacteroides and decreased Enterobacteriaceae in colonic biopsies at trial completion. Results suggest a beneficial effect of diet and supplements on host responses and mucosal microbiota in dogs with CE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this randomised blinded clinical trial was to determine if a prebiotic nutritional supplement would result in a change from baseline in the faecal microbiome composition of racing Thoroughbred horses in training being fed a high concentrate/grain-based diet to be more similar to that found in forage fed/pasture grazed horses. Thirty-two horses on one training yard were randomised to either receive the supplement or not. Faecal samples were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks for NGS of the 16S ribosomal subunit gene. Twenty-two horses completed the trial, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the intention to treat analysis; 20 horses were included in the per protocol analysis. The mean and median percent decreases in Bacteroidetes, increases in Firmicutes and the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio were significantly greater than zero for the treated horses only. Supplemented horses (8/10) were more likely than control horses (2/10) to show an increase in Firmicutes of a &#8805;9% with &#8805;24% increase in Clostridia, &#8805;5% decrease in Bacteroidetes, &#8805;16% increase in the F:B ratio and &#8805;2% increase in Actinobacteria (RR = 4, 95% CI: 1.1-14.4, p = 0.01).

Two 14-week-old female Dogue de Bordeaux siblings presented with fever and severe, acute onset limb lameness; traumatic lesions with evidence of infection were identified over the lame limbs of both dogs. The patients were euthanised owing to lack of therapeutic response and rapid escalation to systemic infection with central nervous system manifestations. The post-mortem changes consisted of multiple disseminated abscesses, mainly affecting the skin and subcutis at the limb traumatic injuries, local and hilar lymph nodes, lung, kidney and brain. Bacterial culture and identification via MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed Nocardia farcinica from several of these sites in both dogs. Clinical significance of the isolate was supported by cytology of the post-mortem organs' impression smears showing numerous branching filamentous bacteria associated with inflammation. The organism displayed marked multidrug-resistance. No history of immunosuppression was available, and immunohistochemistry ruled out viral pathogens as canine distemper and parvovirus. N. farcinica should be considered as a potential differential cause of sudden lameness and systemic infection in dogs with traumatic skin lesions over the limbs. This is the first reported small-scale outbreak of systemic nocardiosis in dogs due to N. farcinica.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, disease caused by PCV2, PCV3, or PCV4 is hard to distinguish, so a rapid and sensitive detection method is urgently needed to differentiate these three types. In this study, four pairs of specific primers and the corresponding probes for PCV 2, -3, and -4, and porcine endogenous gene &#946;-Actin as the positive internal reference index, were designed to establish a TaqMan multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the simultaneous differential diagnosis of different types of viruses. The results showed that this assay has good specificity and no cross-reactivity with other important porcine viral pathogens. Furthermore, it has high sensitivity, with a detection limit of 101 copies/&#956;L, and good reproducibility, with intra- and inter-group coefficients of variation below 2%. Subsequently, 535 clinical samples of suspected sow reproductive disorders collected from Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces from 2020 to 2022 were analyzed using the established assay. The results showed that the individual positive rates of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 were 31.03%, 30.09%, and 30.84%, respectively; the mixed infection rates of PCV2 and PCV3, PCV2 and PCV4, and PCV3 and PCV4 were 31.03%, 30.09%, and 30.84%, respectively; the mixed infection rate of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 was 28.22%. This indicated that this assay provides a convenient tool for the rapid detection and differentiation of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 in pig farms in East China. Our findings highlight that there are different types of porcine circovirus infection in pig farms in East China, which makes pig disease prevention and control difficult.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of commercial essential oils (EOs) from Origanum vulgare, Satureja montana, and Thymus vulgaris, as well as a mixture of these three components, against 47 clinical bacterial strains (Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens) and 5 Malassezia pachydermatis strains, previously cultured from the ears of dogs affected by otitis externa. The tested Gram-positive bacteria were sensible to the analysed EOs with MICs ranging from 1.25% (v/v) to &lt;0.0195% (v/v); Gram-negative isolates, mainly P. aeruginosa, were less sensitive with MICs from &gt;10% (v/v) to 0.039% (v/v). M. pachydermatis isolates were sensitive to all EOs with MICs from 4.25% (v/v) to 2% (v/v). However, the mixture was active against all bacterial (except one P. aeruginosa strain) and fungal tested isolates. The three EOs and their mixture seem to be an interesting alternative for treating canine otitis externa when conventional antimicrobials are not active.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In five adult Beagles under anesthetic maintenance, DTI was performed using a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Axial DTI was performed using three overlapping slabs to cover the cervical and thoracic spinal cords. After post-processing, DTI parameters were calculated along the entire spinal cord. Among DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy, relative anisotropy, and axonal diffusivity significantly decreased in the caudal direction. However, the apparent diffusion coefficient, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity values were not significantly correlated with vertebral levels. We provide evidence for the existence of segment-dependent DTI parameters in the canine cervical spinal cord. Therefore, comparisons of DTI parameters between lesions at different vertebral levels should be avoided unless normative data are available. Furthermore, the DTI data obtained in this study may contribute to the development of a clinical reference for spinal cord evaluation in dogs using DTI parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The successful application of image processing technology in different fields has attracted much attention in the field of agriculture in recent years. This research was done to ascertain the number of indigestible cereal grains in animal feces using an image processing method. In this study, a regression-based way of object counting was used to predict the number of cereal grains in the feces. For this purpose, we have developed two different neural network architectures based upon Fully Convolutional Regression Networks (FCRN) and U-Net. The images used in the study were obtained from three different dairy cows enterprises operating in Nigde Province. The dataset consists of the 277 distinct dropping images of dairy cows in the farm. According to findings of the study, both models yielded quite acceptable prediction accuracy with U-Net providing slightly better prediction with a MAE value of 16.69 in the best case, compared to 23.65 MAE value of FCRN with the same batch.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

NT-proBNP was measured only in stage B1 and B2 dogs. Clinical stage did not have a significant effect on PON-1 concentrations (p = 0.149), but NT-proBNP levels were lower in B1 dogs (p = 0.001). A significant correlation between PON-1 and total plasma proteins (p = 0.001), albumin (p = 0.003) and white blood cell count (p = 0.041) was detected, whereas there was no significant correlation (p = 0.847) between PON-1 and NT-proBNP concentrations. PON-1 showed a significant but weak negative correlation with normalized left ventricular internal diameter at diastole (LVIDdn) (p = 0.022) and systole (LVIDsn) (p = 0.012), as well as mitral valve E to A wave velocity ratio (MV E/A) (p = 0.015), but not with Left Atrial to Aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) (p = 0.892) or fractional shortening (FS%) (p = 0.944). PON-1 seems to be an insensitive marker of clinical stage and disease severity in MVD, but can be indicative of some clinico-pathological and echocardiographic changes. NT-proBNP changes are independent of oxidative stress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of rabies in bats according to food habits, taxonomic classification, sex and season of the year to identify possible risk factors for rabies occurrence in bats. A retrospective analysis of 6389 records of bat samples, from different municipalities of S&#227;o Paulo, submitted to rabies diagnosis and taxonomic identification was carried out at the Rabies Diagnostic and Chiroptera Laboratories of Unesp Ara&#231;atuba, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, from 1998 to 2017. Seventy-six (1.1%) positive rabies cases were detected in bats from ten species and seven genera of three families. The number of rabies-positive cases was higher in the dry season, with a significant association. The prevalence was higher in the Vespertilionidae family (37), especially Myotis nigricans (19) and Eptesicus furinalis (14). Frugivorous bats had a greater association with positivity for rabies, whereas the variable "sex" had no association. We recommend that the surveillance and control of rabies should be undertaken primarily during the dry season, especially in the Vespertilionidae family species and other species with a frugivorous food habit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, 180 dairy cows (90 of each breed: Holstein and Montb&#233;liarde) were used. Each breed's tested dairy cows were divided into two groups of comparable size (45 cows each), mastitis-free and mastitis-affected groups. Each cow's jugular vein was punctured to obtain blood samples for DNA and RNA extraction. In the examined Holstein and Montb&#233;liarde dairy cows, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related with mastitis resistance/susceptibility were found in the RASGRP1, NFkB, CHL1, MARCH3, PDGFD, MAST3, EPS15L1, C1QTNF3, CD46, COX18, NEURL1, PPIE, and PTX3 genes. Chi-square analysis of identified SNPs revealed a significant difference in gene frequency between mastitic and healthy cows. Except for CHL1, mastitic dairy cows of two breeds had considerably higher mRNA levels of the examined genes than did healthy ones. Marker-assisted selection and monitoring of dairy cows' susceptibility to mastitis may be accomplished through the use of discovered SNPs and changes in the gene expression profile of the studied genes. These findings also point to a possible method for reducing mastitis in dairy cows through selective breeding of animals using genetic markers linked to an animal's ability to resist infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, healthy Oreochromis niloticus were fed with 0-10 times the therapeutic dose of 15 mg kg biomass[-1] day[-1] for 10 days and tracked for 43 days post dosing. Assessments of residue accrual and depletion, oxidative stress, serum biochemistry, histopathology and extent of kidney and liver damages were made. FFC dosing reduced the feed intake significantly. The therapeutic dose produced no mortalities on day 10. Dose-dependent alterations in serum biochemistry were noted upon dosing. Several histopathological alterations were observed in the kidney and liver, which vindicated the toxic potentials of FFC. The residual FFC and florfenicol amine (FFA) accrual, depletion and oxidative stress responses, such as increased malondialdehyde, total nitric oxide, ferric reducing antioxidant power and reduced glutathione S-transferase activity, were documented. The dietary FFC persuaded the physiological state of O. niloticus, the effects of which normalized sparsely with time upon cessation of dosing at the higher doses. The study provided a brief outlook on the physiological responses upon oral FFC administration, which should be kept in mind during its application for fish health safety purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Vaccination treatment did not affect performance nor BRSV serum-neutralizing antibody titers. Serum-neutralizing antibody titers to BVDV-1 were greatest for the MM through D 154. However, following booster (KM) or initial vaccination (WN) at D 127, titers increased for the other treatment groups to higher values (KM) by the end of the study. Delay of initial vaccination until weaning may have delayed specific antibody response in the WN group and skewed the immune response towards a Th-1 or cell-mediated response. Overall, the inclusion of an MLV in the vaccine protocol resulted in a more robust antibody response, and the timing of vaccination may affect the onset of efficacious and robust vaccine responses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The uterine samples from 856 dromedary camels yielded a total of 17 different bacterial species with a higher proportion of sub-fertile camel uteri being colonized by bacteria (66.6%) as compared to nulliparous, recently calved, and those with unknown reproductive history combined (44.2%; p &lt; 0.05). Camels with body condition scoring &lt; 3 and those with a consistently echogenic appearance of the uterine lumen by sonography were more likely to be positive on uterine culture, while the presence of pus in uterine discharge was not associated with the odds of bacterial isolation (p &gt; 0.05). While certain strains were more likely to be obtained from the uteri of the sub-fertile group (p &lt; 0.05), embryo transfer to camels with a positive uterine culture in the absence of other gross reproductive pathologies did not necessarily affect the overall pregnancy rate compared to recipients with a negative uterine culture (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, a relatively high bacterial load can be identified from the uteri of both sub-fertile and normal dromedary camels, with a higher frequency among the former. The uterine ultrasonography and evaluation of the body condition score can help in identifying the camels in which uterus is contaminated by bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669040</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>An Epidemiological Survey to Investigate the Prevalence of Cystic Echinococcosis in Slaughtered Bovine Hosts in Punjab, Pakistan.</Title>	<Abstract>Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected zoonotic disease of worldwide geographical distribution. CE is most common in underdeveloped and herding communities where people survive on animal husbandry and agricultural activities. The prevalence of CE in livestock and its risk factors are widely underreported, because of inefficient surveillance systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and prevalence of CE in cattle in Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected from slaughterhouses from September 2021 to February 2022. Ante- and postmortem examination and cyst characterization were performed. Epidemiological, demographic, and one health data were collected. A total of 8877 animals (8096 buffalo, 781 cattle) were examined, and the prevalence of CE was 6.22% (n = 552) in all animals, with a higher prevalence in cattle (15.20% vs. buffalo 5.83%). Prevalence was not significantly different in males and females. Of the 23 districts studied, the highest prevalence was in the Haripur district of KP (20.85%). The majority of animals studied were older than 3 years. Most cysts were found in animals older than 5 years. Lungs and liver were the predominant sites for the presence of cysts (65.58% and 31.34%, respectively. Of the collected cysts, 29.71% were fertile. The findings may be useful in estimating the eco-epidemiology of CE and improving surveillance and prevention programs in Pakistan.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study presents a rudimentary characterisation of the syndrome, presenting gross pathology of syndromic signs upon visual inspection, a histological examination of palate malformations, and syndrome incidence data representing the past two decades. The syndrome presents with a range of signs, primarily congenital palate malformations ranging from a pinhole cleft to a complete hard and soft palate deficit, resulting in the death or abandonment of neonates shortly after birth. The congenital palate malformations are often associated with claw deformities, wiry facial hair, and in some instances, muscle weakness and neurological signs. The natural occurrence of the lethal congenital orofacial birth defects in the spectacled flying fox presents a unique opportunity for the investigation of putative aetiologies, drawing parallels between bat and other mammalian cleft palate risk factors. Further syndrome investigation has the potential to deliver both biodiversity conservation and comparative veterinary and biomedical outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study's aims were to measure the standard coagulation parameters, and to assess the relationship between them and the clinical variables in dogs with canine parvoviral enteritis. Nine client-owned dogs with a canine parvoviral infection were included in a prospective, observational clinical study. Clinical score and coagulation status were assessed at admission. All nine dogs showed alterations of three or more standard coagulation variables. A correlation analysis evidenced a significantly high positive correlation between the activated partial thromboplastin time and clinical score. The present study concurs that dogs with canine parvoviral enteritis have coagulation disorders that are detectable by measuring the standard coagulation parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study included 92 serum samples collected from 68 domestic and 24 stray cats aged from 3 months to 20 years of age in the period of January-June 2021. The samples originated from three regions in Bulgaria and from three places of inhabitance. DR-ELISA based on peroxidase-labeled SARS-CoV-2 N protein was employed to detect IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies in the samples. Subsequently, the results were compared with a commercially available multi-species ELISA kit. There was high seroprevalence (83.33%) in stray cats and 41.18% in domestic cats, confirmed by the human and veterinary ELISA kit. The positive cases in the regional cities were 42.86%, in small towns 50% and in villages 78.26%. Cats under 7 years had a five times higher risk than those over 7 years (p = 0.001). The risk was seven times higher for stray cats than for domestic cats (p = 0.001). In addition, the results indicate that the risk was the highest for cats in villages (p = 0.006) compared to cats in other places of inhabitance. This study demonstrates that human DR-ELISA may be successfully applied to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and other susceptible species. Cats might serve as sentinel animals for tracking the virus in nature and in inhabited areas (strays) and to discover asymptomatic cases in humans/owners.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the synepitheliochorial placenta of the cow myofibroblasts are found in the maternal stroma. However, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of the stromal myofibroblasts in the developed bovine placenta is still missing. Thus, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses in bovine term placentomes, compared to non-pregnant caruncle samples, were conducted. To investigate functional aspects, contractility of placentomal caruncle slices was assessed in an in vitro contraction assay. Additionally, a three-dimensional reconstruction of a bovine placental myofibroblast was created. Immunofluorescent staining revealed a characteristic pattern, including cytoplasmic expression of &#945;-smooth muscle actin, strong perinuclear signal for the intermediate filament vimentin and nuclear progesterone receptor staining. Ultrastructurally, stress fibers, extended cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear intermediate filaments were observed. Moreover, in vitro stimulation with angiotensin-II, but not with prostaglandin F2&#945;, induced contraction of placental caruncle tissue. Altogether, these results indicate that progesterone-responsive myofibroblasts represent a mesenchymal phenotype that is involved in the contractile properties of bovine placental stroma. Therefore, the present findings suggest a potential involvement of myofibroblasts in post-partum events of cattle, i.e., expulsion of fetal membranes and uterine involution.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

German Holstein heifers (n = 236) were checked for vestibulum vaginae and vaginal injuries. These were scored according to localization, depth and length. The healing process was assessed until day 42 post partum. Calving ease and the occurrence of metritis and endometritis were evaluated. In 160 heifers, the following fertility measures were calculated to assess the reproductive performance of heifers: mean interval from calving to first insemination, mean days open, mean interval from first insemination to conception, mean calving interval, mean pregnancy index, percentage of animals pregnant at 200 days p.p., and first service conception rate. On the one hand, dystocia was a risk factor for injuries of the soft birth canal, and, on the other hand, those injuries were a risk factor for metritis and endometritis. In this study, calving-related injuries of the vestibulum vaginae and the vagina had no statistically significant effect on the reproductive performance of heifers. One reason for this outcome was probably the overall good healing tendencies of those injuries in heifers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Assessment of parameters, such as degree of differentiation, necrosis score and mitotic score, give rise to a final tumour grade, which is important in determining prognosis and subsequent treatment modalities. However, grading discrepancies are reported to occur in human and canine STSs, which can result in complications regarding treatment plans. The introduction of digital pathology has the potential to help improve STS grading via automated determination of the presence and extent of necrosis. The detected necrotic regions can be factored in the grading scheme or excluded before analysing the remaining tissue. Here we describe a method to detect tumour necrosis in histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) of STSs using machine learning. Annotated areas of necrosis were extracted from WSIs and the patches containing necrotic tissue fed into a pre-trained DenseNet161 convolutional neural network (CNN) for training, testing and validation. The proposed CNN architecture reported favourable results, with an overall validation accuracy of 92.7% for necrosis detection which represents the number of correctly classified data instances over the total number of data instances. The proposed method, when vigorously validated represents a promising tool to assist pathologists in evaluating necrosis in canine STS tumours, by increasing efficiency, accuracy and reducing inter-rater variation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The 871 samples (75.2%) of kittens were younger than 12 months, of which 693 were males, and 456 were females. Among the samples, 443 were British shorthair cats, accounting for 38.3%, and 252 were Chinese rural cats, accounting for 21.8%. PCR/RT-PCR detection of the above four viruses (FCV, FHV-1, M. felis, and C. felis) in the upper respiratory tract of cats showed that the total positive samples were 744 (64.3%), including 465 positive samples of feline calicivirus, accounting for 40.2% of the total 1158 samples. There were 311 positive samples of M. felis, accounting for 26.9% of the total samples, ranked second in clinical practice. The 180 positive samples of feline herpesvirus accounted for 15.5%, and 85 positive samples of Chlamydia felis accounted for 7.3%. Among them, the number of positive samples of single pathogenic infections was 493, accounting for 66.3% of the total 744 positive samples. Double, triple, and quadruple infections accounted for 28.2%, 5.0%, and 0.5%, respectively, with the highest proportion of single infections. The molecular biological characteristics of the 17 isolated FCVd strains in Wuhan were further analyzed. It was found that the F9 vaccine strain and the antigenic epitopes in the 5'HVR of the E region were collated with the F9 vaccine strain. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the strains related to the F9 and 255 vaccines were distantly related, leading to the failure of the vaccine. In addition, the strains associated with the F9 and 255 vaccines were distant, which might lead to vaccine failure in anticipation of the development of a more phylogenetically close FCV vaccine in China and may require the development of a vaccine for a locally related FCV strain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

According to the literature we hypothesized that there are associations of electrical conductivity variables of milk flow with lameness in dairy cows. The aim of this study was to determine if blood cortisol and electrical conductivity in the milk flow phases correlate with each other and whether they are related to cow lameness. On one farm, out of 1500 cows, 64 cows with signs of lameness and 56 healthy cows were selected with an average of 2.8 lactations and 60 days in the postpartum period. A local veterinarian who specializes in hoof care treatments identified and scored lameness. During evening milking, the milk flow of all 120 cows was measured using electronic milk flow meters (Lactocorder&#174;, WMB AG, Balgache, Switzerland). Before each milking, two electronic mobile milk flow meters (Lactocorders) were mounted between the milking apparatus and the milking tube to take measurements. We found that the average cortisol concentration in the blood of the studied cows was significantly correlated with the laminitis score. Results of this study indicate that the number of non-lame cows with a milk electrical conductivity level of &lt;6 mS/cm even reached 90.8&#8722;92.3% of animals. Milk electrical conductivity indicators &#8805; 6 mS/cm were determined in 17.8&#8722;29.0% more animals in the group of lame cows compared to the group of non-lame cows. According to our study, we detected that blood cortisol concentration had the strongest positive correlation with milk electrical conductivity indicators. Cows with a greater lameness score had a higher cortisol content and milk conductivity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The presence of multiple serotypes and strains with diversified sequence types in pig herds highlights the need for the identification of broadly cross-reactive universal vaccine antigen targets, capable of providing cross-protection against S. suis infection. Subunit vaccines based on the conserved proteins shared between different S. suis serotypes are potential candidates for such a universally protective vaccine. In the present study, phosphate ABC transporter ATP-binding protein PstB (PstB), an immunogenic protein of the S. suis bacterium, was expressed and purified, and then subjected to cross-protection evaluation in mice. The PstB protein showed nearly 100% amino acid similarity across a panel of 31 S. suis isolates representing different serotypes, which were collected from different countries. A recombinant PstB (rPstB) protein (S. suis serotype 2) was recognized by rabbit sera specific to this serotype, and induced high levels of IFN-&#947; and IL-4 in mice immunized with the recombinant protein. These cytokines are considered important for protection against S. suis infection. Immunization of mice with rPstB resulted in an 87.5% protection against challenge with S. suis serotype 2 and 9 strains, suggesting a high level of cross-protection for S. suis serotypes 2 and 9. A lower protection rate (62.5%) was observed in mice challenged with the S. suis serotype 7 strain. These data demonstrate that PstB is a promising target antigen for development as a component of a universal subunit vaccine against multiple S. suis serotypes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

No data are available regarding the molecular epidemiology of strangles in Indonesia. This study aimed to characterize S. equi equi isolates obtained from suspected strangles cases in Indonesia in 2018. Isolates originated from seven diseased horses on four different farms located in three provinces of Indonesia. Whole genome sequences of these isolates were determined and used for seM typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and core genome MLS typing (cgMLST). Genomes were also screened for known antimicrobial resistance genes and genes encoding for the recombinant antigens used in the commercial Strangvac[&#174;] subunit vaccine. All seven S. equi equi isolates from Indonesia belonged to ST179 and carried seM allele 166. Isolates differed from each other by only 2 to 14 cgSNPs and built an exclusive sub-cluster within the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) cluster 2 (BAPS-2) of the S. equi equi cgMLST scheme. All isolates revealed predicted amino acid sequence identity to seven and high similarity to one of the eight antigen fragments contained in Strangvac[&#174;]. Furthermore, all isolates were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin G, ampicillin, and ceftiofur. Our data suggest that the horses from this study were affected by strains of the same novel sublineage within globally distributed BAPS-2 of S. equi equi. Nevertheless, penicillin G can be used as a first-choice antibiotic against these strains and Strangvac[&#174;] may also be protective against Indonesian strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

AQPs are classified into classical aquaporins (AQP0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8), aquaglycerolporins (AQP3, 7, 9, and 10) and superaquaporins (AQP11 and 12). Nine AQPs were described in the mammalian female reproductive tract. Some of their functions are influenced by sexual steroid hormones. The continuous physiological changes that occur throughout the sexual cycle, pregnancy and parturition, modify the expression of AQPs, thus creating at every moment the required water homeostasis. AQPs in the ovary regulate follicular development and ovulation. In the vagina and the cervix, AQPs are involved mainly in lubrication. In the uterus, AQPs are mostly mediated by estradiol and progesterone to prepare the endometrium for possible embryo implantation and fetal development. In the placenta, AQPs are responsible for the fluid support to the fetus to maintain fetal homeostasis that ensures correct fetal development as pregnancy goes on. This review is focused on understanding the role of AQPs in the mammalian female reproductive tract during the sexual cycle of pregnancy and parturition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, morphological data of these tissues in farm animals are scarce. This study investigated the gross anatomical and histological features of genital organ-associated lymphoid tissues (GOALTs) in the vaginal vestibule (VV) of healthy, non-pregnant, adult goats and pigs. Their VVs were composed of stratified squamous, non-keratinized epithelium, and various-sized dark-blue hematoxylin-positive spots were observed in whole-mount specimens, which were diffusely distributed throughout the mucosal surfaces. These spots were histologically identified as LTs and consisted of lymphatic nodules (LNs) or diffuse lymphoid tissue (DLTs). Both LNs and DLTs contained B cells, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, plasma cells, and high endothelial venules. Only the numbers of B cells were significantly higher in both the LNs and DLTs of pigs compared to goats. Furthermore, the surface of the VV epithelium covering the LTs was partially disrupted with a large intercellular space containing abundant connective tissue fibers with numerous lymphocytes. In conclusion, GOALTs in the VV appear to be common local immunological barriers in both examined animals. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the structures and disorders of female reproductive organs in farm animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This trend also appears to be occurring in companion animals, with guardians preferring to feed their animals in accordance with their own dietary values and choices. However, there has been controversy amongst vets and online commentators about the safety of feeding vegan diets to carnivorous species, such as cats and dogs. In spite of this controversy, to date there has been no systematic evaluation of the evidence on this topic. A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed, identifying 16 studies on the impact of vegan diets on cat and dog health. Studies were appraised for quality using established critical appraisal tools or reporting guidelines. There was considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes measured, and study designs employed, with few studies evaluating key outcomes of interest. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was utilized for assessment of certainty in the evidence, with the evidence for most outcomes being assessed as low or very low. Whilst the quality and amount of evidence needs to be considered in formulating recommendations, there was no overwhelming evidence of adverse effects arising from use of these diets and there was some evidence of benefits. It is, however, recommended that future high-quality studies, with standardized outcome measures and large sample sizes, be conducted. At the current time, if guardians wish to feed their companion animals vegan diets, a cautious approach should be taken using commercially produced diets which have been formulated considering the nutritional needs of the target species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to exposure to xenobiotics, several harmful effects on aquatic organisms are noticed worldwide. Mangrove crabs are an ecologically important aquatic invertebrate species in food web interactions and in the mangrove ecosystem. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of chlorpyrifos on the mangrove crab, Episesarma tetragonum. Crabs were exposed to 0.0294 and 0.0588 ppm of chlorpyrifos for 7 and 28 days. Cytopathologic effects on the gill, hepatopancreas, and muscle were investigated, and observations were compared with a control group. The results suggest that chlorpyrifos induces time- and concentration-dependent cytopathological alternations in the gill and exhibited epithelial lifting, oedema, necrosis, and a fusion of secondary lamellae and haemorrhage. The deceased hepatopancreas showed infiltration, a large lumen formation, and the disappearance of haemocytes, while the muscle tissue showed atrophy, necrosis, a wavy appearance, an accumulation of granular material between muscle fibres, and fragmentation in a mangrove crab. This study shows the great potential of cytopathological investigations, allows us to assess the sensitivity of various aquatic animal species to potentially dangerous compounds, and calculates safe concentrations with which to reduce pesticide use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess the occurrence of blood parasites in nocturnal raptors (Strigiformes order) and their effect on hematological parameters. A total of 134 blood samples were collected during a four-year period for hematological analysis and hemoparasite detection and quantification by microscopical examination of the samples. Overall, the occurrence of hemoparasites was 35.1%, with Leucocytozoon being the most frequently detected (32.1%), followed by Haemoproteus (11.2%), Trypanosoma and Plasmodium (2.2% each). Among the different bird species, the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) showed the highest blood parasite positivity (94.7%). In barn owls, the positive birds displayed a lower hematocrit measurement and body condition score than the non-parasitized ones (p = 0.007 and p = 0.005, respectively), especially those parasitized by Leucocytozoon. Moreover, the analysis of the magnitude of this association revealed that the presence of hemoparasites is five times more frequent in barn owls with a 2/5 body condition score. Despite the host-parasite coevolution in Strigiformes, our results show a correlation between the presence of hemoparasites and some health parameters, including blood parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is associated with systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, dysbiosis, and the so-called leaky gut syndrome, which mainly results from oxidative stress reactions that damage the barrier function of the cells lining the gut wall. Poultry, especially the genetically selected broiler breeds, frequently suffer from these chronic stress symptoms when exposed to multiple stressors in their growing environments. Since oxidative stress reactions and inflammatory damages are multi-stage and long-term processes, overshooting immune reactions and their down-stream effects also negatively affect the animal's microbiota, and finally impair its performance and commercial value. Means to counteract oxidative stress in poultry and other animals are, therefore, highly welcome. Many phytogenic substances, including flavonoids and phenolic compounds, are known to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this review, firstly, the main stressors in poultry, such as heat stress, mycotoxins, dysbiosis and diets that contain oxidized lipids that trigger oxidative stress and inflammation, are discussed, along with the key transcription factors involved in the related signal transduction pathways. Secondly, the most promising phytogenic substances and their current applications to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in poultry are highlighted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present review, we focus on the role of microRNAs in ruminant health and disease; additionally, we discuss the potential of circulating microRNAs as biomarkers of disease in ruminants and the state of technology for their detection, also considering the major difficulties in the transition of biomarker development from bench to clinical practice. MicroRNAs are an inexhaustible class of endogenous non-protein coding small RNAs of 18 to 25 nucleotides that target either the 3' untranslated (UTR) or coding region of genes, ensuring a tight post-transcriptionally controlled regulation of gene expression. The development of new "omics" technologies facilitated a fresh perspective on the nutrition-to-gene relationship, incorporating more extensive data from molecular genetics, animal nutrition, and veterinary sciences. MicroRNAs might serve as important regulators of metabolic processes and may present the inter-phase between nutrition and gene regulation, controlled by the diet. The development of biomarkers holds the potential to revolutionize veterinary practice through faster disease detection, more accurate ruminant health monitoring, enhanced welfare, and increased productivity. Finally, we summarize the latest findings on how microRNAs function as biomarkers, how technological paradigms are reshaping this field of research, and how platforms are being used to identify novel biomarkers. Numerous studies have demonstrated a connection between circulating microRNAs and ruminant diseases such as mastitis, tuberculosis, foot-and-mouth disease, fasciolosis, and metabolic disorders. Therefore, the identification and analysis of a small number of microRNAs can provide crucial information about the stage of a disease, etiology, and prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

VP2 gene sequencing placed the IPNV isolate in genogroup 6, for which pathogenicity is largely unknown. Lake V&#228;nern hosts landlocked sea trout and salmon populations that are endangered, and thus the introduction of new pathogens poses a major threat. In this study we characterized the novel isolate by conducting an infection trial on three salmonid species present in Lake V&#228;nern, whole genome sequencing of the isolate, and prevalence studies in the wild sea trout and salmon in Lake V&#228;nern. During the infection trial, the pathogenicity of the Swedish isolate was compared to that of a pathogenic genogroup 5 isolate. Dead or moribund fish were collected, pooled, and analyzed by cell culture to identify infected individuals. In the trial, the Swedish isolate was detected in fewer sample pools in all three species compared to the genogroup 5 isolate. In addition, the prevalence studies showed a low prevalence (0.2-0.5%) of the virus in the feral salmonids in Lake V&#228;nern. Together the data suggest that the novel Swedish IPNV genogroup 6 isolate is only mildly pathogenic to salmonids.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669060</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Investigation of Theileria and Babesia Species in Domestic Mammals from Sardinia, Italy.</Title>	<Abstract>Piroplasmoses are tick-borne diseases caused by hemoprotozoan parasites of veterinary and public health significance. This study focuses on the molecular identification and characterization of species belonging to the Theileria/Babesia genera in 152 blood samples, collected from 80 horses and 72 cattle from several farms in Sardinia, by targeting the 18S rRNA gene. The PCR results highlighted that 72% of the samples were positive for Theileria/Babesia spp., with a rate of infection of 68% and 75% for the horses and cattle, respectively. Sequencing and the BLASTn analysis showed that the 18S rRNA generated in this study has 99-100% homology with the B. bigemina, T. orientalis/sergenti/buffeli, T. equi and T. annulata strains isolated from different hosts worldwide. These findings improve the knowledge on Babesia and Theileria infections in domestic mammals and confirm the significant prevalence of piroplasmosis among subclinical and carrier animals throughout the island. Furthermore, the presence of T. annulata, reported for the first time in the study area, expands the repertoire of pathogens already detected in Sardinia. Our results gather updates on the diversity and distribution of piroplasms in Sardinia and suggest the need to develop procedures to improve animal and public health safety.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669061</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Treatment of a Recurrent Pyometra by Surgical Uterine Drainage in a Main Coon Cat.</Title>	<Abstract>Pyometra is a uterine disease typical of the luteal phase of the estrus cycle. For selected patients, such as breeding subjects, ovariohysterectomy is not a valid resolutive option. Medical treatments involving cloprostenol and aglepristone have been developed for the cats, but they can be ineffective in rare cases. Transcervical drainage and flushing have been described for the dogs, as well as for large wild cats. However, to the author's knowledge, there are no report of uterine drainage in cats. The present case describes an alternative treatment of pyometra in a 3-year-old Main Coon previously treated with aglepristone. The patient underwent a laparotomy: the uterus was exposed, and a sterile urinary catheter was inserted into each horn, through the wall of the uterus, to allow the drainage of pathological collection and a subsequent lavage with lukewarm sterile saline. Medical treatment with aglepristone and marbofloxacin was associated. After treatment, no recurrence was reported, and the cat had an uneventful pregnancy. Although it is a unique case report, the results presented are promising, as the technique appears to have provided healing and preserved fertility. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in the long-term prevention of recurrence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This retrospective study aimed at the comparison of the frequency and type of complications detected when using different human laparoscopy devices for laparoscopic access in standing horses, and the influence of body condition in such complications. Forty-four procedures were included, and retrieved data comprised cannula insertion technique, body condition, and type and frequency of complications. Laparoscopic access techniques were classified into five groups: P: pneumoperitoneum created using Veress needle prior to cannulation; T: sharp trocar; D: direct access via surgical incision; V: Visiport optical trocar and H: optical helical cannula (OHC). In groups T, D, V and H, access was achieved without prior induction of pneumoperitoneum. Complications were registered in 13/44 procedures, of which retroperitoneal insufflation was the most common (6/13). Statistically significant association was found between the complication incidence and the type of access, with group D showing the highest complication frequency (80%) and group H the lowest frequency (0%). The majority of complications (9/13) were observed in overweight horses. We conclude that devices designed for human patients can be used for laparoscopic access in standing horses, with the use of OHC minimizing the appearance of complications, especially in overweight horses with OW.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36669063</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Current Perspectives on the Challenges of Implementing Assistance Dogs in Human Mental Health Care.</Title>	<Abstract>The prevalence of mental health disorders, driven by current global crises, is notably high. During the past decades, the popularity of dogs assisting humans with a wide spectrum of mental health disorders has significantly increased. Notwithstanding these dogs' doubtless value, research on their legal status, certification processes, training and management practices, as well as their welfare status, has been scarce. This scoping review highlights that in contrast to other assistance dogs such as guide dogs, there exists no consistent terminology to mark dogs that assist humans with impaired mental health. Legal authorities monitoring the accreditation process, training and tracking of mental health supporting dogs are broadly lacking, with only few exceptions. This review emphasizes the need to address several topics in the promotion of progress in legal and welfare issues related to assistance dogs as well as emotional support dogs for humans with a mental health disorder. The current body of knowledge was assessed in three different areas of focus: (1) the legal dimension including definitions and certification processes; (2) the dimension of performed tasks; and (3) the dog welfare dimension including aspects of the relationship with the handler and risks associated with children recipients. Considering the challenges associated with a mental health diagnosis, collaborations of dog provider organizations and health care professionals would be desirable to continuously assess the efficiency of the human-dog dyad regarding their overall compatibility, general satisfaction and mutual well-being.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the epidemiological characteristics of PRRSV after the outbreak of African swine fever in China were not thoroughly investigated. In the present study, the serological and epidemiological investigations of PRRSV in pigs from the Hunan and Hebei provinces of China were assessed. The results showed that 73.12% (95% CI 71.74-74.49) of pigs were positive for PRRSV-special antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Out of 5799 samples, 482 (8.31%, 95% CI 7.60-9.02) samples were positive for PRRSV nucleic acids. The positive rates of PRRSV in healthy pigs from farms and slaughterhouses were 2.27% (47/2072) and 7.70% (217/2818), which were lower than that in diseased pigs (23.98%, 218/909). Furthermore, the full-length OFR5 gene sequences of 43 PRRSV strains were sequenced and analysed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 43 isolates were classified into three lineages, namely lineage 1 (n = 24), lineage 8 (n = 15), and lineage 3 (n = 4). Lineage 1 could be further divided into sublineage 1.5 (n = 2) and sublineage 1.8 (n = 22), and lineage 8 was classified into sublineage 8.1 (n = 3) and sublineage 8.7 (n = 12). Collectively, our findings revealed the severe prevalence of PRRSV in the Hunan and Hebei provinces, where sublineage 1.8 and sublineage 8.7 predominated. The present study provides the update information of the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of PRRSV in the investigated regions, which will be beneficial for PRRS control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Total locomotor behavior was recorded by means of an activity data logger every 5 min for 6 consecutive days. To do that eight clinically healthy 30-day-old Holstein calves living in calf boxes under natural photoperiod and environmental conditions were enrolled. ANOVA (analysis of variance) showed a statistical effect of the day of monitoring and animal. In the temporal distribution of the resting-activity frequency, it was observed that the calves presented periods of total locomotor behavior with the existence of two peaks, one between 06:00-07:00 and another between 17:00-18:00, which corresponds to time of food intake. In all animals, a diurnal daily rhythm of total locomotor behavior was observed during time of monitoring. Intrasubject and intersubject variabilities were statistically different in mesor, amplitude, and robustness of rhythm. In conclusion, the total locomotor behavior showed a diurnal daily rhythmicity in 30-day-old calves. The characteristics of rhythm were different from individual to individual and from day to day. The recorded intersubject variability must be taken in consideration during the monitoring of farm animals and justifies the application of the device to each animal, as precision livestock farming suggests.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Non-invasive monitoring of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) can be utilised to evaluate the impact of stressors. The aim was to determine if the tetrahydrocorticosterone (50c) and cortisol enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) could be effective in measuring FCM values in wild, stressed koalas. This research included 146 koalas from the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital (AZWH) and 88 from a study conducted by Endeavour Veterinary Ecology (EVE), Queensland, Australia. Faecal samples of diseased, injured and control koalas were analysed. The effect of hospitalisation on FCM values was also investigated. Diseased and injured koalas had significantly higher FCM values than clinically healthy control animals as measured by the 50c EIA. FCM values with the cortisol EIA differed significantly between control and diseased koalas, but not between control and injured ones. Moreover, only the 50c EIA detected higher absolute values in males compared to females, and also found that females showed a more elevated response to stress manifested by injury and disease compared to males. The 50c EIA detected stress during hospitalisation better than the cortisol EIA. The cortisol EIA was also found unreliable in detecting stress in rehabilitated koalas treated with synthetic glucocorticoids as it cross-reacts with these steroids providing artificially high values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 198 canine corneal stromal ulcer samples were studied between 2018 and 2021. A corneal swab was collected and cultured under aerobic conditions. Bacterial organisms were identified at the species level by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility testing for commonly used topical and systemic antibiotics was performed by disk diffusion. Bacterial growth was obtained from 80% of samples. A variety of bacterial species were identified wherein the most common specimens were represented by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (22%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), Staphylococcus capitis (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). Based on the overall antibiotic susceptibility data, neopolybac alone (96%) or a combination of neopolybac with either ofloxacin or amikacin (each 99%) showed the best coverage for commonly isolated bacterial organisms from canine corneal stromal ulcers. Results of this study support the use of the combined antibiotics as the first-line response for the treatment of canine corneal stromal ulcers. A statically significant increase in acquired bacterial resistance was detected during the longitudinal data observation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A randomized complete block design was used at two US commercial feedlots. Steers and heifers [2366 total; 261 (&#177;11.0) kg initial weight] were blocked by sex and feedlot arrival, and allocated to one of two pens within a block (16 pens total, eight blocks). Pens were randomly assigned to treatment: META, tulathromycin injection at initial processing; or PT, tulathromycin injection only for first clinical BRD treatment. Data were analyzed with linear and generalized linear mixed models. There was greater BRD morbidity in PT than META cattle (17.2% vs. 7.3% respectively; p &lt; 0.01), and greater total mortality (2.5% vs. 1.1% respectively; p = 0.03). Per animal enrolled, 1.1 antimicrobial doses were used for META compared to 0.2 for PT (p &lt; 0.01). Per animal enrolled, final live (p = 0.04) and carcass (p = 0.08) weights were greater for META than PT; however, net returns ($/animal) were not significantly different (p = 0.71). Compared to PT, total lifetime estimated CO2 equivalent emissions from production were reduced by 2% per unit of live weight for META (p = 0.09). While antimicrobial use was reduced with PT, there may be substantial negative impacts on other outcomes if META was not used in this type of cattle population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851373</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Assessing the Role of Systems Thinking for Stocker Cattle Operations.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is recognized as a complex multifactorial disease often resulting in significant economic losses for the stocker industry through reduced health and performance of feeder calves. Conventional approaches to manage BRD in stocker production systems can be challenged with a restricted view of the system, most importantly the structure, which drives the behavior of the system and fails to anticipate unintended consequences. The translation and implementation of systems thinking into veterinary medicine can offer an alternative method to problem-solving. Fundamental to the success of the systems thinker is the conceptualization of the Iceberg Diagram intended to identify root causes of complex problems such as BRD. Furthermore, veterinary and animal health professionals are well-positioned to serve as facilitators to establish creative tension, the positive energy necessary to identify high-leverage strategies. The interrelationships and interconnected behaviors of complex stocker systems warrant an understanding of various archetypes. Archetypes provide the systems thinker with a decision-making tool to explore tactics in a nonlinear fashion for the purpose of recognizing short- and long-term outcomes. Developing literacy in the discipline of systems thinking will further equip professionals with the skillset necessary to address the multitude of challenges ingrained in complex stocker cattle systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To resolve the condition, a modified technique using a lateral approach and plate/rod sliding humeral osteotomy (SHO) was considered. All dogs recovered uneventfully after surgery. There were no major complications, and all dogs were significantly improved compared to pre-operative condition. This novel technique of adding a pin, based on the alteration of the original technique, optimized resistance to fixation failure. An additional benefit was that the lateral approach was surgically familiar and easily allowed bone grafting. All five dogs treated with the novel approach had improved scores for pain and lameness. This study showed that SHO was more stable and less technically demanding with the addition of an intramedullary pin. This is the first report of a lateral approach and plate rod sliding humeral osteotomy to treat MCDE in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We investigated antibiotic resistance and correlations between resistance patterns in skin infections. Records from 2009 to 2019 were searched for Staphylococcal infection and susceptibility results. Seventy-seven cases were included. Organisms identified were S. aureus (48/77), S. pseudintermedius (7/77), non-hemolytic Staphylococcus (8/77), beta-hemolytic Staphylococcus (6/77), and other species (8/77). Samples included pyoderma (36/77), wounds (10/77), abscesses (15/77), incision sites (5/77), nose (8/77), and foot (3/77). A trend analysis using non-parametric Spearman's test showed significant upward trend of resistance (p &lt; 0.05) for 3/15 antibiotics (ampicillin, cefazolin, penicillin). Susceptibility was significantly different by Staphylococcal species for 8/15 antibiotics. Gentamicin showed significant susceptibility differences based on source (all abscesses were susceptible to gentamicin). Steel-Dwass test showed statistically significant (p = 0.003) difference between incision sites and abscesses. A non-parametric Kendall's T-test found significantly negative correlation between cefazolin and amikacin sensitivity (p = 0.0108) and multiple positive correlations of resistance (p &lt; 0.05). This study confirms increasing resistance in dermatologic samples. It is unlikely that the sample source affects resistance, but Staphylococcus species may affect it. Study limitations include lack of information about previous antibiotic use and small sample size.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to compare the semen quality traits of Thai Native chickens (Pradu Hang Dam and Chee) producing high and low semen volume. Semen was collected from 24 roosters (12 reps) and divided into two groups of roosters producing high semen volume (&gt;0.3 mL) and those producing a low amount of semen (&lt;0.3 mL). Fresh semen quality parameters (semen volume, sperm motility, viability, concentration, and pH) were measured and compared between groups. It was found that semen volume showed a positive correlation with sperm concentration, mass movement, motility, viability, and pH of fresh semen. There was no significant difference in fresh semen parameters between Pradu Hang Dam and Chee roosters with either high or low ejaculate semen, except for sperm concentration. Sperm concentration was significantly higher in Chee compared with Pradu Hang Dam in both high and low ejaculate semen. The semen quality parameters between groups of chickens producing high and low ejaculate semen were significantly different except for sperm viability. In conclusion, it was found that chickens producing high volumes of semen have better sperm quality than those producing a low semen volume. Therefore, these results provide a possible consideration that the amount of semen production among chickens can be used as a tool in selecting Thai native roosters for breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study aimed to assess the prevalence and viability of cystic echinococcosis in examined camels. In addition, assessing the histological, morphological, oxidative, and antioxidant state related to the cystic echinococcosis infection; (2) Methods: The study was performed on 152 slaughtered dromedary camels between March and September 2022 at El-Basatin abattoir in Cairo Governorate, Egypt; (3) Results: The results revealed that the prevalence of hydatidosis was 21.7% in slaughtered camel and the highest infection rate observed in lungs was 87.87%, while it was 9% in livers. Camels' liver infections were rare, whereas their lung infections were more common. By comparing to non-infected camels, the level of MAD was significantly increased with hydatid cysts infection, while the level of GSH, SOD and CAT was significantly decreased. Histopathological section of camel cyst revealed layered membranes surrounded by a zone of cellular infiltration and an outermost fibrous tissue reaction. In addition, there was evidence of atelectasis, emphysema, hemorrhage, congestion, and fibrosis in the surrounding tissues. Nonetheless, the degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes and other pathological alterations in liver cyst sections were remarkably comparable to those seen in the lungs. Furthermore, calcification was detected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The intensification of fish production and the movement of aquatic animals could cause the spread of infectious diseases. Remarkably, the diffusion of viral agents represents the major bottleneck for finfish production, and viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is considered the most impacting disease for Mediterranean aquaculture. No effective therapies are available to contrast VER, and vaccination can be applied only in grow-out facilities. Hence, programs to minimize the sanitary risks in farms are paramount to implementing hygienic standards and biosecurity. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro virucidal activity of a peroxy-acid disinfectant (Virkon[&#174;] S, DuPont, Sudbury, UK) towards the two NNV strains most widespread in the Mediterranean Sea. Remarkably, two protocols were applied to assess the virucidal activity under different conditions of use: the suspension test and the net test. The latter has been applied to evaluate the efficacy of the biocide on instruments, simulating the in-field application. The obtained results demonstrated the suitability of the tested biocide for NNV inactivation, being effective under some of the tested conditions. However, the presence of organic matter, the concentration of the product, and the application conditions can significantly affect the result of the disinfection procedure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the circular RNAs involved in breast muscle development in ducks have not yet been studied. Here, to identify circular RNAs during duck skeletal muscle development, three pectorales from Shan Ma ducks at E13 and E19, which represent undifferentiated and differentiated myoblasts, respectively, were collected and subjected to RNA sequencing. A total of 16,622 circular RNAs were identified, of which approximately 80% were exonic circular RNAs and 260 were markedly differentially expressed between E19 and E13. The parental genes of the differentially expressed circular RNAs were significantly enriched in muscle-related biological processes. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of circGAS2-2 promoted cell cycle progression and increased the proliferation viability of duck primary myoblasts; conversely, knockdown of circGAS2-2 retarded the cell cycle and reduced the proliferation viability of myoblasts. Taken together, our results demonstrate that circular RNAs are widespread and variously expressed during the development of duck skeletal muscle and that circGAS2-2 is involved in the regulation of myogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851381</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluating the Effect of Preventative Trimming on Distance from the Sole Surface to the Distal Phalanx Using Ultrasonography for Lameness Prevention in Pasture-Based Dairy Cows.</Title>	<Abstract>One common management strategy used to reduce the risk of lameness is prophylactic claw trimming. However, in pasture-based cattle, there is a concern that the immediate reduction in sole thickness resulting from sole trimming will lead to medium-to-long-term reductions in sole thickness, which may increase the risk of lameness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of data on sole thickness and trimming in pasture-based cows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of trimming on sole thickness over the medium-to-long term, as estimated using the ultrasound-measured distance from the external claw sole surface to the distal phalanx (DDP) and of DDP on the interval between calving and increased locomotion scores. A total of 38 cows were randomly selected from a 940-cow spring calving dairy farm in the North Island of New Zealand; 18 were allocated to the ultrasound hoof-trimming group and 20 were allocated to the ultrasound non-trimming group. Starting in May 2018, at the end of the 2017/18 lactation, ultrasound measurements of DDP of the right hind hoof were made on all 38 cows, and the hindlimbs of the trimming group cows were trimmed by an experienced professional hoof trimmer using the five-step Dutch method. This was repeated in October 2018 (early lactation) and May 2019 (late lactation). After calving, the cows were locomotion scored fortnightly until the end of lactation using the 4-point (0-3) scale DairyNZ system. The effect of DDP on the interval between calving and the first locomotion scores &#8805;1 and &#8805;2 was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, and the association between trimming and DDP was explored using linear mixed models. The results suggest that DDP has no effect on the time to locomotion scores &#8805;1 or &#8805;2, although the wide confidence intervals of the latter suggest that more data are needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. The study failed to find any clinically important impact of prophylactic trimming on DDP. This is likely related to the finding that cows with the highest DDP at the first trimming were identified by the hoof trimmer as those needing the most trimming. The results of this study thus suggest that if the Dutch five-step method is properly applied, it is unlikely to affect sole thickness over the short-to-medium term in pasture-based cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Horses with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs from all regions of the United States were included in a voluntary biosurveillance program from 2008 to 2020 and nasal secretions were tested via qPCR for S. equi and common respiratory viruses. A total of 715/9409 equids (7.6%) tested qPCR-positive for S. equi, with 226 horses showing coinfections with EIV, EHV-1, EHV-4, and ERBV. The median age for the S. equi qPCR-positive horses was 8 &#177; 4 years and there was significant difference when compared to the median age of the S. equi qPCR-negative horses (6 &#177; 2 years; p = 0.004). Quarter Horse, Warmblood, and Thoroughbred were the more frequent breed in this horse population, and these breeds were more likely to test qPCR-positive for S. equi compared to other breeds. There was not statistical difference for sex between S. equi qPCR-positive and qPCR-negative horses. Horses used for competition and ranch/farm use were more likely to test qPCR-positive for S. equi (p = 0.006). Horses that tested S. equi qPCR-positive were more likely to display nasal discharge, fever, lethargy, anorexia, and ocular discharge compared to horses that tested S. equi qPCR-negative (p = 0.001). Vaccination against S. equi was associated with a lower frequency of S. equi qPCR-positive status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, 128 (Duroc, Yorkshire and Landrace) pigs with an average initial body weight of 28.38 &#177; 0.25 kg were allocated to four dietary treatments in a randomized complete-block design. There were eight pens per treatment, with four pigs per pen (two barrows and two gilts). Dietary treatments included: (1) control diet; (2) control diet + 0.05% complex probiotic; (3) control diet + 0.1% complex probiotic; (4) control diet + 0.2% complex probiotic. During the 28-day experimental period, the feeding of 0.1% complex probiotic in the diet increased body weight and average daily gain (p &lt; 0.05). The addition of complex probiotics decreased total cholesterol and glucose concentrations in the blood (p &lt; 0.01). Acetate concentrations in the blood increased from 0.1% complex probiotic in the diet (p &lt; 0.05), while NH3 and H2S emissions in the feces decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from 0.1% or 0.2% complex probiotic in the diet. In conclusion, dietary complex probiotic supplementation changed the composition of intestinal short-chain fatty acids and improved growth performance for growing pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 24 crossbred male pigs aged 26 days selected from a specific pathogen-free herd were randomly divided into four groups (six pigs per group) and assigned as follows: negative control (unvaccinated/sham-challenge), vaccinated with chimeric PCV1-2a vaccine (PCV1-2a/PCV2d-challenge), vaccinated with chimeric PCV1-2a-2b vaccine (PCV1-2a-2b/PCV2d-challenge) and positive control (unvaccinated/PCV2d-challenge). At 21 days after vaccination, the pigs were intranasally and intramuscularly inoculated with either sham or field isolates of PCV2d (PCV2d/149/TH/2020). After being challenged, blood samples were obtained weekly and analyzed for levels of PCV2d viremia, neutralizing antibodies, and IgG against PCV2. At 30 days post-challenge (DPC), the pigs were euthanized and then subjected to pathological evaluations and molecular analysis. The results indicated that pigs in the PCV1-2a-2b/PCV2d-challenge and the PCV1-2a/PCV2d-challenge groups possessed significantly greater levels of PCV2d-neutralizing antibody titer when compared with the positive control group. Moreover, pigs in the PCV1-2a-2b/PCV2d-challenge group exhibited a lower degree of severity in terms of gross lesion scores and lower levels of PCV2 viremia when compared with the positive control group. This study demonstrated that vaccinating pigs with either the PCV1-2a or PCV1-2a-2b chimeric vaccines elicits a potent immune response against PCV2d infection and reduces viremia after PCV2d inoculation in pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(2) Methods: We investigated postnatal SST expression and its effects on hippocampal neurogenesis via administering SST subcutaneously to P7 mice for 7 days. (3) Results: In the hippocampal CA1 region, SST immunoreactivity reaches peak at P14. However, SST immunoreactivity significantly decreased at P21. In the CA2/3 region, the SST expression pattern was similar to the CA1, and SST-immunoreactive cells were most abundant at P14. In the dentate gyrus, SST-immunoreactive cells were most abundant at P7 and P14 in the polymorphic layer; as in CA1-3 regions, the immunoreactivity decreased at P21. To elucidate the role of SST in postnatal development, we administered SST subcutaneously to P7 mice for 7 days. In the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a significant increase was observed in immunoreactivity of doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuroblast after administration of SST.; (4) Conclusions: SST expression in the hippocampal sub-regions is transiently increased during the postnatal formation of the hippocampus and decreases after P21. In addition, SST is involved in neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It was previously reported that a cohort of dogs with various liver diseases had increased urinary isoprostane concentrations compared to healthy control (HC) dogs. The aim of this study was to measure and report urinary isoprostane concentrations in dogs with different types of liver diseases. Urine was collected from 21 HC dogs and from 40 dogs with liver disease, including 25 with chronic hepatitis (CH), 7 with steroid hepatopathy (SH), and 8 with a congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS). In this prospective, observational study, urinary 15-F2t-isoprostane (F2-IsoP) concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and normalized to urinary creatinine concentrations. Concentrations were compared between groups using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons tests. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. The median (range) urinary F2-IsoP to creatinine ratios (ng/mg UCr) were 3.6 (2.2-12.4) for HC dogs, 5.7 (2.4-11.3) for dogs with CH, 4.8 (2.4-8.6) for dogs with SH, and 12.5 (2.9-22.9) for dogs with CPSS. CPSS dogs had significantly higher urinary F2-IsoP concentrations than HC dogs (p = 0.004), suggesting increased oxidative stress among this cohort.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The most frequently studied mammary diseases are mastitis in cows and ewes and mammary tumours in dogs and cats. Various imaging techniques such as computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonographic techniques (Doppler, contrast-enchanced, three-dimensional and elastography) are available and can be applied in research or clinical practice in order to evaluate possible abnormalities in mammary glands, as well as to assist in the differential diagnosis. In this review, the above imaging technologies are described, and the perspectives of each method are highlighted. It is inferred that ultrasonographic modalities are the most frequently used imaging techniques for the diagnosis of clinical or subclinical mastitis and treatment guidance on a farm. In companion animals, a combination of imaging techniques should be applied for a more accurate diagnosis of mammary tumours. In any case, the confirmation of the diagnosis is provided by laboratory techniques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Esculetin, a coumarin derivative, reportedly induces death in different types of cancer cells. In this study, we explore the anticancer effects of esculetin against CMT-U27 and CF41.mg canine mammary gland tumor cells. Esculetin significantly inhibited the viability and migration of both CMT-U27 and CF41.mg cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay revealed increased numbers of annexin-V-positive cells and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, a cell cycle analysis demonstrated that esculetin blocked the cell progression at the G0/G1 phase and the S phase in CMT-U27 and CF41.mg cells. These results were supported by a Western blot analysis, which revealed upregulated protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, and downregulated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin D1 protein, the cell cycle regulators. In conclusion, this novel study proves that esculetin exerts in vitro antitumor effects by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in canine mammary gland tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify pre- and post-partum risk factors associated with a high heifer mastitis rate (HMR), and to find out which period (either pre- or post-partum) contains more risk factors and consequently should be the focus of mastitis control in heifers. A total of 77 herds were included in this study and the potential animal- and farm-related risk factors were recorded during a one-time farm visit. The HMR was provided by the dairy herd improvement test (DHI) as the annual average of the past 11 DHIs. For this study, data were analyzed in two models using generalized linear models. Each model examined the association between possible risk factors and HMR, one including only prepartum risk factors and the other one only post-partum risk factors. One identified pre-partum risk factor was the proportion of udder-healthy cows in the herd. Post-partum risk factors were the type of teat cleaning procedure before milking, teat disinfection, treatment of mastitis in heifers, a body condition score (BCS) of &gt;3.0 in fresh heifers, and the combination of a teat cleaning procedure with a teat disinfectant. The results show the importance of the period shortly after calving for udder health in heifers, as four of the five significant risk factors were identified in this period and three of them were related to the milking process. However, further research with a higher number of herds is needed to minimize individual herd effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To investigate, for the first time, the clinical significance of CTEN in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of dogs, we studied a total of 45 SCC sections from various dog breeds. The mean age of the affected dogs was 8.9 &#177; 3.6 years. Immunohistochemistry confirmed strong cytoplasmatic CTEN expression in the basal layer of the epidermis next to the tumor. We detected high CTEN expression associated with the highest grade of the tumor (grade III) and observed 100% of immunopositivity for this tumor grading (p &lt; 0.0001). These data suggest that CTEN is an oncogene in SCC of dogs and a promising biomarker and a therapeutic target for dogs affected by SCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 100 suckling pigs [(Large White &#215; Landrace) &#215; Duroc; 4.5 &#177; 0.54 kg initial body weight (BW)] were used and assigned to each of the four dietary treatments as follows: (1) a control diet with antibiotics as a growth promoter (AGP) from the suckling phase to the grower phase and no supplement in the finisher phases; (2) a control diet without antibiotics as a growth promoter (NAGP); (3) a control diet with HK L-137 at 20 mg/kg from the suckling phase to the starter phase and no supplement from the grower phase to the finisher phases (HKL1); and (4) a control diet with HK L-137 at 20 mg/kg from the suckling phase to the weaner phase, at 4 mg/kg from the starter phase to the finisher 1 phase, and no supplement in the finisher 2 phase (HKL2). During the weaner-starter period, the pigs fed on the AGP and HKL2 diets showed significantly higher weight gain and average daily gain (ADG) than those in the NAGP group (p &lt; 0.05). The pigs in the AGP, HKL1, and HKL2 groups showed greater ADG than those in the NAGP groups (p &lt; 0.05) throughout the grower-finisher period. The suckling pigs in the HKL1 and HKL2 groups showed a higher platelet count (484,500 and 575,750) than in the others (p &lt; 0.05); however, there were no significant differences in the other hematological parameters among the treatment groups. The relative mRNA expression level of IFN- &#223; of the suckling and starter pigs were significantly higher in the HKL1 and HKL2 groups than in the others (p &lt; 0.05), while the IFN-&#947; showed the highest level in the HKL2 suckling pigs (p &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that a HK L-137 supplementation could stimulate the immune response in suckling and starter pigs and promote the growth performance in finishing pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This may potentially suggest an underlying genetic predisposition not yet completely elucidated. Some authors have suggested a potential correlation between the number of copies KIT Ligand (KITLG) and the predisposition of dogs to DSCC, containing a higher number of copies in those affected by the neoplasm. In this study, the aim was to evaluate a potential correlation between the number of copies of the KITLG and the histological grade of malignancy in dogs with DSCC. For this, 72 paraffin-embedded DSCCs with paired whole blood samples of 70 different dogs were included and grouped according to their haircoat color as follow: Group 0/unknown haircoat color (n = 11); Group 1.a/black non-Schnauzers (n = 15); group 1.b/black Schnauzers (n = 33); group 1.c/black and tan dogs (n = 7); group 2/tan animals (n = 4). The DSCCs were histologically graded. Additionally, KITLG Copy Number Variation (CNV) was determined by ddPCR. A significant correlation was observed between KITLG copy number and the histological grade and score value. This finding may suggest a possible factor for the development of canine DSCC, thus potentially having an impact on personalized veterinary oncological strategies and breeding programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Furthermore, there is a need to better describe when cattle are being treated for BRD. The first objective was to perform a cluster analysis on the temporal distributions of cumulative first treatment BRD from HIGH (&#8805;15% of cattle received treated for BRD) and LOW cohorts (&gt;0 and &lt;15% of cattle received treated for BRD) to assess cohort-level timing (days on feed) of BRD first treatments. The second objective was to determine associations among cluster groups (temporal patterns) and demographic risk factors, health outcomes, and performance. Cluster analysis determined that optimal number of clustering groups for the HIGH morbidity cohort was six clusters and LOW morbidity cohort was seven clusters. Cohorts with zero BRD treatment records were added for statistical comparisons. Total death loss, BRD morbidity, average daily gain (ADG), railing rate, days to 50% BRD, cattle received, shrink, arrival weight, and sex were associated with temporal groups (p &lt; 0.05). These data could be used as a tool for earlier identification and potential interventions for cohorts based on the BRD temporal pattern.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dog ownership can confer various health benefits to their owners, but it also presents some risks. In order to establish if dog owners were aware of these risks, an online survey of dog ownership practices was carried out. The survey was open during the month of January 2022 and received 662 responses regarding 850 individual dogs. Overall, 52% of people reported deworming their dog between zero and twice a year, which is unlikely to reduce the risk of infection to humans. The majority of dog owners (71%) reported disposing of faeces correctly; however, when comparing urban and rural environments, 33% of those in rural environments did not dispose of their dogs' faeces at all, compared with 3% of people in urban locations. People who obtained their dog during the pandemic brought their dog to the vet and dewormed them more frequently than those who obtained their dog before the pandemic. There were no differences in how faeces was disposed of between these groups. These results indicate that we, as researchers and veterinarians, have much work to do in terms of educating dog owners about the ways in which we can reduce the risk of infection to ourselves and our communities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cellulose is a common dietary fiber used mainly in powdered form. However, other processing forms and fibers are available as fibrous additives. This work aimed to test the effects of different fiber sources on apparent total tract digestibility and fecal quality in dogs. Four diets were fed to eight dogs (experimental design: 4 &#215; 4 Latin square) for a 14-day period each. In addition to a basal diet (CO), three experimental diets varying in fiber sources were used: powdered cellulose (CE), granulated cellulose (GC), and lignocellulose (LC). Dogs fed the CO had lower crude fiber digestibility than those fed the other experimental diets (p &lt; 0.0033). Dogs fed diets supplemented with fiber sources had lower gross energy digestibility (range: 76.2-77.3%) compared with those fed the CO (84.4%). In all groups, the fecal score (consistency and shape) ranged within the optimal values; solely wet fecal output was increased for the fiber groups compared with those on the CO. This study demonstrated that various sources of fiber such as GC and LC can be used as alternatives to CE without restrictions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Defining the optimal AMU and the associated practical rules is challenging since AMU interacts with many parameters. To define the trade-offs between decreased AMU, labor and economic performance, the bioeconomic stochastic simulation model DairyHealthSim (DHS)&#169; was applied to dairy cow mastitis management and coupled to a mean variance optimization model and marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) analysis. The scenarios included three antimicrobial (AM) treatment strategies at dry-off, five types of general barn hygiene practices, five milking practices focused on parlor hygiene levels and three milk withdrawal strategies. The first part of economic results showed similar economic performances for the blanked dry-off strategy and selective strategy but demonstrated the trade-off between AMU reduction and farmers' workload. The second part of the results demonstrated the optimal value of the animal level of exposure to AM (ALEA). The MACC analysis showed that reducing ALEA below 1.5 was associated with a EUR 10,000 loss per unit of ALEA on average for the farmer. The results call for more integrative farm decision processes and bioeconomic reasoning to prompt efficient public interventions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bacterial infection of the device is one of the most common complications. Human guidelines recommend besides systemic antibiotics, surgical explantation of the pacing lead and pulse generator in case of device-infection. This report describes a 13.5-year-old dog that received a transvenous endocardial permanent pacemaker because of syncopal episodes resulting from paroxysmal third-degree atrio-ventricular block. Five days after an uneventful surgery, a painful swelling appeared around the subcutaneous part of the lead where this was inserted into the jugular vein. A 4-week course of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combined with enrofloxacin failed to clear the infection on long-term. Ultrasound-guided puncture of the abscess was performed to gain a sample for bacterial culture and antibiogram. Oral clindamycin of 4 weeks' duration successfully resolved the infection with Staphylococcus aureus without having to explant the device. Repeated ultrasonographic examinations and fine-needle aspiration biopsies were used to evaluate for persistent local inflammation, guiding the length of the antibiotic therapy. Though the described approach has traditionally been ill-advised because of the risk of introducing bacteria and damaging the pacemaker lead, it was successful in our case.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study involved 13 Belgian blue cows of a previous dataset of 76 animals. Bacteriology was performed on swabs sampled from visceral and parietal peritoneum during the CS. Amplicon sequencing was performed in six samples chosen randomly among the swabs positive for bacteriology and seven among the culture-negative swabs. A total of 2542 bacterial operational taxonomic units belonging to 567 genera were identified. The most often identified genus and species were Mycoplasma (44%) and Mycoplasma wenyonii (36%), respectively. Results showed no difference in microbiota composition between the culture-positive and -negative samples. However, a difference was observed between the bacteriology and amplicon sequencing results. Indeed, seven out of nine cultured strains were not identified by amplicon sequencing in the samples in which they were cultured. In contrast to bacteriology, amplicon sequencing unveiled the presence of bacterial DNA in all elective CSs. The most identified DNA is most likely derived from the haematogenous spread of bacteria to the surgical site. Furthermore, the cultured bacteria were not the dominant species in the sample from which they were cultured.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Six dogs were washed with plain water on day (D)0. Twelve dogs were shampooed on D0 and received eight mousse applications at 48-72 h intervals from D2 to D18. Clinical score (CS), Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF) and hair lipids (HL) were evaluated on D0, D0 + 4 h, D7, D14 and D24. At baseline, no significant differences were observed in CS, NMF and HL between groups. In the control group, CS and HL remained stable throughout the study while a slight decrease in NMF was observed at D0 + 4 h. CS was significantly reduced in the test group between D0 and D7 (-53%) which reached 91% at D24 (p &lt; 0.05), with no side effects. NMF levels decreased in the test group at D0 + 4 h (-73%, p &lt; 0.0001) and returned to baseline from D14.

Their growing use and clinical importance necessitate our improved understanding of physiological effects of antimicrobial drugs, including their potential effects on the central nervous system (CNS), at molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. In addition, antimicrobial drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota, and hence affect the gut-microbiota-brain axis, further modulating brain and behavioral processes. Complementing rodent studies, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) emerges as a powerful model system for screening various antimicrobial drugs, including probing their putative CNS effects. Here, we critically discuss recent evidence on the effects of antimicrobial drugs on brain and behavior in zebrafish, and outline future related lines of research using this aquatic model organism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Natural products, which are safe and have no negative impact on the environment, may be utilized in the therapy of an enormous range of parasitic infections. This research aimed to assess the effectiveness of VVLE on the oocyst sporulation of an E. papillate infection in the mouse jejunum. In addition, obtaining the ideal concentration will interrupt the parasite's life cycle and limit infection. In vitro: Collected unsporulated oocysts (1 &#215; 10[3]) of E. papillata were given six different concentrations (w/v) of Vitis vinifera leaf extract (10, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/mL) and toltrazuril (25 mg/mL), three replicates per group, whereas the control group received 2.5% potassium dichromate solution. In vivo: The mice were separated into six groups; the first and second groups did not receive infection, whilst the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth groups were each given 1 &#215; 10[3] sporulated oocysts of E. papillate in the experiment. In addition, an oral dosage of 100 and 200 mg/kg VVLE were given to the fourth and fifth groups, while the sixth group was given toltrazuril at 25 mg/kg. On the fifth day, unpopulated oocysts were collected from each mouse separately. The incubation period and treatments had considerable impacts on the rate of sporulation. The infrared spectroscopy of V. vinifera extract revealed many expected active classes of chemical compounds. Further, the infection of mice with E. papillata caused an oocyst output of nearly 2 &#215; 10[4] oocysts/g of faeces. VVLE significantly decreased the oocyst output to nearly 88%. In addition, we detected an inhibitory effect on the sporulation (%) and harm (%) of E. papillata oocysts in a dosage-dependent modality compared with the control group. Furthermore, they destroyed the oocyst morphology in terms of the shape, size, and quantity of sporocysts. The results indicate that grape vines have powerful activity as anticoccidials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 500 broiler chickens were randomly distributed into five dietary treatment groups, following a completely randomized design, where, at the beginning, the control group (C) was fed a diet containing the standard CP and Lys levels: 23% CP with 1.44% Lys during the starter period; 21.5% CP with 1.29% Lys during the growing period; and 19.5% CP with 1.16% Lys during the finishing period. The Lys content was increased by 10% above the recommended control basal requirements in the second group (Gr1) and by 20% in the third group (Gr2), while using the same recommended CP percentage as the C group. The fourth group (Gr3) had a 1% lower CP content and the fifth group had a 2% lower CP content than the C group, with the same recommended AA level as the C group. Increasing the Lys content in the Gr1 group improved the broilers' weight gains (p &lt; 0.05) during the starter, growing, and finishing periods. Decreasing dietary CP with the standard AA levels (Gr3 and Gr4) did not significantly affect (p &gt; 0.05) the live weight gain, feed intake, or feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the broilers compared with those fed with the C diet. Blood total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very LDL were not different among the experimental groups. However, blood aspartate aminotransferase levels were increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the Gr1 and Gr3 groups compared with the other treatment groups. All dietary treatments decreased the serum creatinine levels (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the C group. The Gr2 broilers had greater serum total protein and globulin (p &lt; 0.05) than those receiving the other treatments. Increasing dietary Lys levels resulted in a significant improvement in duodenum villus height and width (p &lt; 0.05), while the low-CP diets resulted in shorter villi length and width, along with degenerated areas and lymphocytic infiltration. Low dietary CP content induced hepatocyte disorganization and moderate degeneration, along with vacuolated hepatic cells, excessive connective tissue, and lymphocytic infiltration. The cortical regions of the kidney exhibited obvious alterations in the Gr3 and Gr4 groups and large interstitial spaces were found between tubules. Renal tubules in the Gr3 and Gr4 groups were smaller in size and some of these tubules were atrophied. In conclusion, reducing dietary CP levels to 1% or 2% lower than the recommended level did not negatively affect growth performance, inducing minimal influence on the blood metabolic indicators of health status, and resulting in moderate alterations to the histomorphology of the duodenum, liver, and kidney. Furthermore, increasing the Lys content by 10% above the recommended level improved the growth performance, health status, and histomorphology of the duodenum, liver, and kidney in broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this report was to investigate the effects of in ovo MSG administration on embryonic chicken eye development using histological and histometric methods. A total of 410 fertilized eggs obtained from Babcock Brown laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were used and divided into 5 groups: I (untreated control), II (vehicle control), III (0.12 mg/g egg MSG), IV (0.6 mg/g egg MSG), and V (1.2 mg/g egg MSG), and injections were performed via the egg yolk. At incubation day 15, 18, and 21, 6 embryos from each group were sacrificed by decapitation and pieces of eye tissue were obtained. In all MSG groups, it was determined that both corneal epithelium thickness and total corneal thickness decreased at incubation time points 15, 18, and 21 days compared with the controls (p &lt; 0.05). The total retinal thickness, thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), ganglion cell layer (GL), and nerve fibre layers (NFL), as well as the number of ganglion cells decreased significantly at incubation days 15, 18, and 21 (p &lt; 0.05), and degenerative changes such as vacuolar degeneration and retinal pigment epithelial detachment were also observed. In conclusion, MSG in ovo administration can affect the cornea and distinct layers of retinal cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main objective of our study was to investigate the health protective effects of dietary milk thistle seed (MS), oil (MO), and seed cake (MSC) in ducks fed diets naturally contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON; 3.43-3.72 mg/kg feed) and zearalenone (ZEN; 0.46-0.50 mg/kg feed). Female White Hungarian ducks were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments consisting of the control diet (C), the control diet supplemented with 0.5% MS, 0.5% MSC, or 0.1% MO. The feeding of experimental diets did not result in mortality cases, clinical signs of mycotoxicosis, or in differences of clinical chemistry values of blood serum. The positive effect of MO on vacuolar hepatocyte degeneration exceeded that of the MSC on d14 and both MS and MSC on d42. Each treatment was equally effective in the decrease of the severity of solitary cell death and infiltration of lympho- and histiocytes in the liver on d28 as well as in the prevention of lymphocyte depletion in the spleen and bursa of Fabricius on d14. In conclusion, the applied treatments have been proven effective in the prevention of histopathological changes caused by DON and ZEN.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851405</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Diagnostic Screening of Bovine Mastitis Using MALDI-TOF MS Direct-Spotting of Milk and Machine Learning.</Title>	<Abstract>Novel strategies for diagnostic screening of animal and herd health are crucial to contain disease outbreaks, maintain animal health, and maximize production efficiency. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland in dairy cows, often resulting from infection from a microorganism. Mastitis outbreaks result in loss of production, degradation of milk quality, and the need to isolate and treat affected animals. In this work, we evaluate MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as a diagnostic for the culture-less screening of mastitis state from raw milk samples collected from regional dairies. Since sample preparation requires only minutes per sample using microvolumes of reagents and no cell culture, the technique is promising for rapid sample turnaround and low-cost diagnosis. Machine learning algorithms have been used to detect patterns embedded within MALDI-TOF spectra using a training set of 226 raw milk samples. A separate scoring set of 100 raw milk samples has been used to assess the specificity (spc) and sensitivity (sens) of the approach. Of machine learning models tested, the gradient-boosted tree model gave global optimal results, with the Youden index of J = 0.7, sens = 0.89, and spc = 0.81 achieved for the given set of conditions. Random forest models also performed well, achieving J &gt; 0.63, with sens = 0.83 and spc = 0.81. Na&#239;ve Bayes, generalized linear, fast large-margin, and deep learning models failed to produce diagnostic results that were as favorable. We conclude that MALDI-TOF MS combined with machine learning is an alternative diagnostic tool for detection of high somatic cell count (SCC) and subclinical mastitis in dairy herds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It was identified in pasture-raised cattle near the border with Iran. Currently, vaccination plays a key role in preventing further incursion of disease in high-risk areas. The purpose of this work was to assess the quality of vaccination currently used in Armenia by determining the immune response of the heterologous dry culture sheep pox virus-based vaccine against LSD in cattle. Seroprevalence and seroconversion testing was carried out using an ELISA to detect specific antibodies against LSD before and 30 days after vaccination in three adjacent regions of Armenia (Ararat, Armavir, Gegharkunik). Ixodes ticks were also examined for the presence of LSDV via real-time PCR. We found that the heterologous vaccine used in Armenia creates a high level of population immunity of 86.09% (83.83-87.97%) and no adverse side effects were observed in cattle. Of the 6 types of Ixodes ticks identified and tested, we found no evidence of LSDV circulating in these vectors. These results suggest that regular serological monitoring via ELISA and heterologous vaccination should continue in areas of Armenia at high risk for incursion of LSD to reduce the spread of this highly infectious transboundary disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851407</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A Comparison of Different Matrices for the Laboratory Diagnosis of the Epizootic American Foulbrood of Honey Bees.</Title>	<Abstract>American Foulbrood (AFB) of honey bees caused by the spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is a notifiable epizootic in most countries. Authorities often consider a rigorous eradication policy the only sustainable control measure. However, early diagnosis of infected but not yet diseased colonies opens up the possibility of ridding these colonies of P. larvae spores by the shook swarm method, thus preventing colony destruction by AFB or official control orders. Therefore, surveillance of bee colonies for P. larvae infection followed by appropriate sanitary measures is a very important intervention to control AFB. For the detection of P. larvae spores in infected colonies, samples of brood comb honey, adult bees, or hive debris are commonly used. We here present our results from a comparative study on the suitability of these matrices in reliably and correctly detecting P. larvae spores contained in these matrices. Based on the sensitivity and limit of detection of P. larvae spores in samples from hive debris, adult bees, and brood comb honey, we conclude that the latter two are equally well-suited for AFB surveillance programs. Hive debris samples should only be used when it is not possible to collect honey or adult bee samples from brood combs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, generation of genetically modified NHPs through traditional methods, such as microinjection into the pronuclei of one-cell embryos, is prohibitive due to the targeting efficiency and the number of NHPs needed as oocyte/zygote donors. Using spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) as the target of gene editing, producing gene-edited sperm for fertilization, is proven to be an effective way to establish gene editing animal disease models. In this experiment, we used ultrasound to guide the echo dense injection needle into the rete testis space, allowing the EGFP lentivirus to be slowly injected at positive pressure from the rete testis into seminiferous tubules. We found Thy1 can be used as a surface marker of cynomolgus monkey SSCs, confirming that SSCs carry the GFP gene. Finally, we successfully obtained transgenic sperm, with a similar freezing and recovery rate to that of WT animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten dogs were included in the study. Surgically created skin incisions were apposed with continuous intradermal suture pattern with 4/0 poliglecaprone 25 with burying of the knots and continuous intradermal pattern with 4/0 polypropylene with clips. Cosmetic, clinical, ultrasonographic and histological scores were evaluated. The intradermal pattern with clips was easier to perform and required significantly less time to complete than the intradermal suture with burying of the knots. Cosmetic, clinical, ultrasonographic and histological evaluation scores did not differ significantly between the techniques. Irrespective of the technique used, the cosmetic, ultrasonographic, clinical and histological appearances of the incisions improved over time. In conclusion, polypropylene was found to be a safe and effective suture material for use with intradermal suture pattern with clips in dogs and to have an easy and quick application. However, in our sample, its earlier removal from wounds than poliglecaprone 25 was not found to be associated with a supposedly beneficial effect on wound healing and scar appearance. Both suture materials can be useful in intradermal suture techniques in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The multiplex qPCR assay could be utilized as a simultaneous diagnostic tool for field-based surveillance and the control of ASFV, PCV2, and PRV. Based on the conserved regions on the p72 gene of ASFV, the Cap gene of PCV2, the gE gene of PRV, and the porcine endogenous &#946;-Actin gene, the appropriate primers and probes for a multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR test effective at concurrently detecting three DNA viruses were developed. The approach demonstrated high specificity and no cross-reactivity with major pathogens related to swine reproductive diseases. In addition, its sensitivity was great, with a detection limit of 10[1] copies/L of each pathogen, and its repeatability was excellent, with intra- and inter-group variability coefficients of &lt;2%. Applying this assay to detect 383 field specimens collected from 2020 to 2022, the survey data displayed that the ASFV, PCV2, and PRV single infection rates were 22.45%, 28.46%, and 2.87%, respectively. The mixed infection rates of ASFV + PCV2, ASFV + PRV, PCV2 + PRV, and ASFV + PCV2 + PRV were 5.22%, 0.26%, 1.83%, and 0.26%, respectively. Overall, the assay established in this study provides an effective tool for quickly distinguishing the viruses causing sow reproductive disorders, suggesting its huge clinical application value in the diagnosis of swine diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The innate immune system is crucial for the host's protection and inflammatory response. However, systematic research is still lacking on how NEB affects the innate immune system to alter the 'host defense capability and inflammatory response. In this investigation, raw transcriptome data of adipose, blood, endometrial, hypothalamus, and liver tissues were downloaded from a public database, cleaned, aligned, quantified, and batch-corrected. The innate immune gene list was retrieved from innateDB, followed by the expression matrix of innate immune genes in various tissues for differential expression analysis, principle component analysis (PCA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Under the effect of NEB, adipose tissue had the most differentially expressed genes, which were predominantly up-regulated, whereas blood GSEA had the most enriched biological processes, which were predominantly down-regulated. The gene sets shared by different tissues, which are predominantly involved in biological processes associated with defense responses and inflammation, were dramatically down-regulated in endometrial tissues and highly up-regulated in other tissues. Under the impact of NEB, LBP, PTX3, S100A12, and LCN2 play essential roles in metabolism and immunological control. In conclusion, NEB can downregulate the defensive response of innate immune genes in endometrial, upregulate the immune and inflammatory response of other tissues, activate the host defense response, and increase the systemic inflammatory response. The analysis of the effects of NEB on innate immune genes from the multiple tissues analysis provides new insights into the crosstalk between metabolism and immunity and also provides potential molecular targets for disease diagnosis and disease resistance breeding in dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Analyzed fecal samples were collected from 60 foxes and 40 wolves in the anthropized areas, and 41 foxes and 39 wolves in the natural areas. In foxes, hookworm infections (p &lt; 0.0001) were more frequently recorded in the anthropized environment, while coccidia (p &lt; 0.05) and Cryptosporidium spp. (p &lt; 0.0001) were more frequent in the natural area. In wolves, a higher frequency of hookworms (p &lt; 0.0001) was observed in natural areas, while coccidia were more common in the anthropized area (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in the natural environment, trichuroid nematodes (p &lt; 0.0001) were significantly more frequent in wolves than in foxes, while Cryptosporidium (p &lt; 0.001) and Giardia duodenalis (p &lt; 0.001) were more common in foxes. In the anthropic area, the occurrence of hookworms was found to be significantly higher in foxes (p &lt; 0.0001), while trichuroid nematodes were more common in wolves (p &lt; 0.0001).

An important challenge related to the implementation of temporary sow confinement is the optimal timing of confinement in crates, considering sow welfare and piglet survival. The objective of this study was to predict farrowing with computer vision techniques to optimize the timing of sow confinement. In total, 71 Austrian Large White and Landrace &#215; Large White crossbred sows and four types of farrowing pens were included in the observational study. We applied computer vision model You Only Look Once X to detect sow locations, the calculated activity level of sows based on detected locations and detected changes in sow activity trends with Kalman filtering and the fixed interval smoothing algorithm. The results indicated the beginning of nest-building behavior with a median of 12 h 51 min and ending with a median of 2 h 38 min before the beginning of farrowing with the YOLOX-large object detection model. It was possible to predict farrowing for 29 out of 44 sows. The developed method could reduce labor costs otherwise required for the regular control of sows in farrowing compartments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Most types and subtypes of these viruses circulate particularly in countries of the southern hemisphere, notably Brazil and Argentina. Therefore, the detection of infected animals is important in defining prevention and control strategies, particularly when flocks are destined for international trade. Identification of infected herds is most often achieved by assays that detect antibodies, such as enzyme immunoassays (ELISAs). However, to date, no ELISA has been evaluated in its capacity to detect antibodies to these alphaherpesviruses. Here, an ELISA was developed to detect antibodies to all currently recognized BoAHV-1, BoAHV-5, and BuAHV-1 types/subtypes, and its sensitivity and specificity were determined. Six hundred bovine sera were screened in serum neutralization tests (SN) against the seven viruses. ELISAs prepared with each of the viruses were compared to SN. Subsequently, a combined assay with multiple antigens LISA was prepared by mixing five viral antigens, chosen for their highest sensitivity in the preparative assays. In comparison to SN, the mAgELISA sensitivity was 96.5% with 96.1% specificity (&#954; = 0.93; PPV = 95.0%; NPV = 97.3%). The findings reveal that the mAgELISA developed here is highly suitable for the detection of antibodies, comparable in sensitivity and specificity to that of SN when performed with all known types and subtypes of bovine and bubaline alphaherpesviruses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PRV could threaten human health as an easily ignored zoonotic pathogen. The emergence of new mutants significantly reduced the protective effect of vaccination, indicating an urgent need to develop specific therapeutic drugs for PRV infection. In this study, we found that dihydromyricetin (DMY) could dose-dependently restrain PRV infection in vitro with an IC50 of 161.34 &#956;M; the inhibition rate of DMY at a concentration of 500 &#956;M was 92.16 %. Moreover, the mode of action showed that DMY directly inactivated PRV virion and inhibited viral adsorption and cellular replication. DMY treatment could improve PRV-induced abnormal changes of the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway and excessive inflammatory response through regulation of the contents of I&#954;B&#945; and p-P65/P65 and the transcriptional levels of cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946; and IL-6). Furthermore, DMY promoted the apoptosis of PRV-infected cells through the regulation of the expressions of Bax and Bcl-xl and the transcriptional levels of Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, thereby limiting the production of progeny virus. These findings indicated that DMY could be a candidate drug for the treatment of PRV infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether the plasma and faecal amino acid profiles differed between control and FRE dogs and whether these could serve as indicators of severity of illness. Blood, faecal samples, body condition score, and severity of clinical signs based on the canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index were collected before starting the elimination diet. FRE dogs had lower proportions of plasma Asparagine, Histidine, Glycine, Cystine, Leucine, and branched-chain/aromatic amino acids; however, Phenylalanine increased. In faecal samples, Cystine was greater whereas Phenylalanine was lesser in sick dogs compared to control. Leucine correlated negatively with faecal humidity (r = -0.66), and Leucine and Phenylalanine with faecal fat (r = -0.57 and r = -0.62, respectively). Faecal Phenylalanine (r = 0.80), Isoleucine (r = 0.75), and Leucine (r = 0.92) also correlated positively with total short-chain fatty acids, whereas a negative correlation was found with Glycine (r = -0.85) and Cystine (r = -0.61).

Recently, bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pattern (BIP) was described as a concerning emerging feedlot lung disease. Necropsies are imperative to assist lung disease diagnosis and pinpoint feedlot management sectors that require improvement. However, necropsies can be logistically challenging due to location and veterinarians' time constraints. Technology advances allow image collection for veterinarians' asynchronous evaluation, thereby reducing challenges. This study's goal was to develop image classification models using machine learning to determine RS diagnostic accuracy in right lateral necropsied feedlot cattle lungs. Unaltered and cropped lung images were labeled using gross and histopathology diagnoses generating four datasets: unaltered lung images labeled with gross diagnoses, unaltered lung images labeled with histopathological diagnoses, cropped images labeled with gross diagnoses, and cropped images labeled with histopathological diagnoses. Datasets were exported to create image classification models, and a best trial was selected for each model based on accuracy. Gross diagnoses accuracies ranged from 39 to 41% for unaltered and cropped images. Labeling images with histopathology diagnoses did not improve average accuracies; 34-38% for unaltered and cropped images. Moderately high sensitivities were attained for BIP (60-100%) and BRD (20-69%) compared to AIP (0-23%). The models developed still require fine-tuning; however, they are the first step towards assisting veterinarians' lung diseases diagnostics in field necropsies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Every machine needs to be validated, as they have not been designed for use in horses. The aim of this study was to compare the newly marketed GEM5000 machine to the formerly validated epoc machine for blood gas analysis in horses. In this prospective, non-blinded, comparative laboratory analyzer study, 43 equine blood samples were analyzed on both analyzers and values were compared between the two machines via Lin's concordance analysis, Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Duplicate measurements were conducted on the GEM5000 machine to evaluate precision. The GEM5000 failed to achieve the required precision for tHb, Hct and iCa[2+], but achieved acceptable precision for all other parameters. Concordance correlation analysis revealed poor correlation for Na[+], Cl[-], iCa[2+], K[+], Hct and tHb, while there was an at least moderate agreement for all other parameters. Passing-Bablok regression revealed significant constant bias for pCO2, pO2, Cl[-], and iCa[2+] and significant proportional bias for pCO2, iCa[2+] and SO2. Bland-Altman analysis revealed significant systematic bias for Na[+], Cl[-], iCa[2+], K[+], Hct, tHb and SO2. This study shows that while precision of the GEM5000 is good, values should not be used interchangeably with data obtained from other blood gas analyzers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to quantify, identify, and molecularly characterize the types of FAdV circulating in commercial poultry farms (broilers, breeders, and layers) in Ecuador from 2019 to 2021. Molecular characterization was performed by PCR, quantification by qPCR, and subsequent sequencing for each positive sample. The results indicated that the FAdV genotypes circulating in our country are FAdV-2/D2, FAdV-6/E1, FAdV-8a/E2, and FAdV-11/D3; the samples were grouped into different groups that contain sequences that were obtained from countries in Africa, Asia, and America, and that are found in birds at different ages, since early age where can cause different clinical signs, such as diarrhea, ruffled feathers and dwarfism. Therefore, these results indicate that several genotypes of the virus are circulating in commercial poultry flocks, suggesting that biosecurity measures on farms should be improved, in addition to carrying out new or improved vaccination plans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ideally, small volumes of drugs should be administered intramuscularly (i.m.). In addition, dose-dependent sedation and anesthesia are desirable properties for sedatives and anesthetics in marmosets. Telazol[&#174;] (tiletamine and zolazepam) is highly concentrated, allowing the use of small injection volumes and dose-dependent sedation and anesthesia. A randomized, blinded study with crossover design in ten healthy adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was performed to evaluate the anesthetic and cardiorespiratory effects of three doses of i.m. Telazol[&#174;] (respectively, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg). Depth of anesthesia, cardiorespiratory effects, and induction, immobilization, and recovery times were determined. A significant difference was observed in immobilization time between 5 and 15 mg/kg of Telazol[&#174;]. In addition, 15 mg/kg of Telazol[&#174;] resulted in increased recovery times compared to 5 mg/kg. The cardiorespiratory effects during the first 45 min of immobilization were within clinically acceptable limits.

We aimed to further characterize PDCoV infection by investigating the presence of virus in respiratory and biliary tissues or fluids; T cell population frequencies in blood; and altered serum cholesterol levels. Twelve, 6-day-old, gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated oronasally with PDCoV OH-FD22 (2.6 &#215; 10[7] FFU/pig). Six control piglets were not inoculated. Rectal swab (RS), nasal swab (NS), nasal wash (NW), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and biliary fluid (BF) samples were collected at 2, 4, and 7 days post-inoculation (DPI) and tested for PDCoV RNA by RT-qPCR. Blood T cell populations and serum cholesterol levels were determined by flow cytometry and a colorimetric assay, respectively. Moderate to high, and low to moderate titers of PDCoV RNA were detected in RS and in NS, NW, BAL, and BF samples, respectively, of inoculated piglets. There were trends toward decreased CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ blood T cell frequencies in inoculated piglets. Furthermore, serum cholesterol levels were increased in inoculated piglets. Overall, we found that PDCoV infection does not exclusively involve the intestine, since the respiratory and biliary systems and cholesterol metabolism also can be affected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the presence of Salmonella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae in house flies captured in small-medium size farms, located in Northwest Tuscany, Central Italy, and to evaluate their antimicrobial resistance; furthermore, isolates were tested for extended spectrum &#946;-lactamase and carbapenems resistance, considering the importance these antimicrobials have in human therapy. A total of 35 traps were placed in seven poultry and 15 swine farms; three different kinds of samples were analyzed from each trap, representing attractant substrate, insect body surface, and insect whole bodies. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 86.36% of farms, 82.87% of traps, and 60.95% of samples; high levels of resistance were detected for ampicillin (61.25% of resistant isolates) and tetracycline (42.5% of resistant isolates). One extended spectrum &#946;-lactamase producer strain was isolated, carrying the blaTEM-1 gene. Salmonella spp. was detected in 36.36% of farms, 25.71% of traps, and 15.24% of samples. Five different serovars were identified: Kentucky, Kisarawe, London, Napoli, and Rubislaw; some isolates were in R phase. Resistance was detected mainly for ampicillin (31.21%) and tetracycline (31.21%). House flies could represent a serious hazard for biosecurity plans at the farm level, carrying and sharing relevant pathogenic and antimicrobial resistant bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In traditional medicine, the virtues of honey and propolis have been well-known for centuries. The same, however, cannot be said for venom. The use of bee venom is particularly relevant for many therapeutic aspects. In recent decades, scientific studies have confirmed and enabled us to understand its properties. Bee venom has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, central nervous system inhibiting, radioprotective, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties, among others. Numerous studies have often been summarised in reviews of the scientific literature that have focused on the results obtained with mouse models and their subsequent transposition to the human patient. In contrast, few reviews of scientific work on the use of bee venom in veterinary medicine exist. This review aims to take stock of the research achievements in this particular discipline, with a view to a recapitulation and stabilisation in the different research fields.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851424</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Role of Femoral Head Size and Femoral Head Coverage in Dogs with and without Hip Dysplasia.</Title>	<Abstract>The subject of hip dysplasia in dogs is still current and preoccupies both animal owners and veterinarians. Major factors affecting the development of the disorder are hip laxity and incongruent joints. Many studies on etiology, pathogenesis, and early diagnosis have been performed to reduce prevalence and select healthy dogs for breeding. The purpose of the present study was to investigate a possible relationship between dysplasia and femoral head area (FHA), femoral coverage by the acetabulum (CFH) and cranio-caudal distance of the dorsal acetabular rim (CrCdAR). Radiographs of a total of 264 skeletally mature dogs with similar physical characteristics (German wirehaired pointers (GWP), German shepherd dogs (GSD) and Labrador retrievers (LAB)) presented for routine hip dysplasia screening were recruited for the study. FHA, CFH and CrCdAR were measured and related to dysplasia status. Evaluations of FHA (p = 0.011), CFH (p &lt; 0.001) and CrCdAR length (p = 0.003) measurements revealed significant interactions between breed, sex and FCI scores, so they had to be assessed separately. The results revealed that FHA tends to decrease as the hip dysplasia score worsens. There was no significant relationship between FHA and dysplasia assessment. FHA is breed-specific and is larger in normal and near-normal male (p = 0.001, p = 0.020) and female (p = 0.001, p = 0.013) GWP compared to GSD, respectively. FHA is greater in normal male GWP (p = 0.011) and GSD (p = 0.040) compared to females. There was a significant and strong positive correlation between FHA and CrCdAR in all breeds and sexes. Additionally, FCI scoring had a medium (GWP, GSD) to strong (LAB) negative correlation with CFH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Iron chelation following transfusion may reduce these risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of deferoxamine on circulating iron and inflammation biomarkers over time and in vitro growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) following RBC transfusion in dogs with atraumatic hemorrhage. Anesthetized dogs were subject to atraumatic hemorrhage and transfusion of RBCs, then randomized to receive either deferoxamine or saline placebo of equivalent volume (n = 10 per group) in a blinded fashion. Blood was sampled before hemorrhage and then 2, 4, and 6 h later. Following hemorrhage and RBC transfusion, free iron increased in all dogs over time (both p &lt; 0.001). Inflammation biomarkers interleukin-6 (IL6), CXC motif chemokine-8 (CXCL8), interleukin-10 (IL10), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) increased in all dogs over time (all p &lt; 0.001). Logarithmic growth of E. coli clones within blood collected 6 h post-transfusion was not different between groups. Only total iron-binding capacity was different between groups over time, being significantly increased in the deferoxamine group at 2 and 4 h post-transfusion (both p &lt; 0.001). In summary, while free iron and inflammation biomarkers increased post-RBC transfusion, deferoxamine administration did not impact circulating free iron, inflammation biomarkers, or in vitro growth of E. coli when compared with placebo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Besides its metabolic effects, thyroid dysfunction, and hypothyroidism in particular, is frequently associated with cognitive decline and depressive-like behavior. The current study aimed to examine the changes in behavior, cognition, and memory in rats with propylthiouracil-induced overt hypothyroidism. The behavior and cognition were assessed using the open field test, T-maze, and novel object recognition test. We found significant differences in the behavioral patterns of the hypothyroid animals showing a reduction in locomotor activity, frequency of rearing, and impaired memory function compared to the euthyroid controls. As serotonin is an essential biomarker regulating cognition and mood, we tried to modulate the serotonin mediation in hypothyroid animals through tryptophan administration. Treatment with 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-OH-TRP) intraperitoneally for 10 days or directly into the hippocampus as a single injection led to attenuation of the hypothyroidism-induced cognitive and memory decline. A staggering amount of research is suggesting that the common denominators in the pathophysiology of depression and the behavior changes in hypothyroidism are the hippocampal complex and the distorted serotonin metabolism. In our study, it was observed a significant alleviation of cognitive impairment and an improvement of memory performance in hypothyroid rats after 5-OH-TRP administration. Current results are promising and may serve as groundwork for further investigation of functional and structural changes in the hippocampus during a hypothyroid state, and in particular, the effects of serotonin mediation in hypothyroid-associated depressive-like behavior.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Analysis of the structure and source of early colonizing bacteria in the intestinal tract of humans and rodents shows that early colonizing bacteria in the intestinal tract of mammals have solid maternal characteristics, and maternal microbes play an essential role in the formation of progeny intestinal flora. The placental microbiome, maternal microbiome and breast milk microbiome are currently hot topics in the field of life science. This paper discusses the vertical transmission and endogenous sources of the mother-to-piglet microbiome through these three pathways, aiming to provide a new research idea for intervention in the intestinal microbiome in young piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, little is known regarding the effects of CM-EXO on bacteria, fungi, HepG2, CaCo2, and Vero cells. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer effects of CM-EXO. EXOs were isolated from CM by ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscope and flow cytometry. Unlike CM, CM-EXO (6 mg/mL) had no bactericidal effects on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and Enterococcus feacalis) but they had bacteriostatic effects, especially against Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis), and fungistatic effects on Candida albicans. HepG2, CaCo2, and Vero cells were respectively treated with CM-EXOs at low (6.17, 3.60, 75.35 &#956;g/mL), moderate (12.34, 7.20, 150.70 &#956;g/mL), and high (24.68, 14.40, 301.40 &#956;g/mL) doses and the results revealed that CM-EXOs triggered apoptosis in HepG2 and CaCo2 cells, but not in normal Vero cells, as revealed by high Bax expression and caspase 3 activities and lower expression of Bcl2. Interestingly, CM-EXOs also induced the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and downregulated the expression of antioxidant-related genes (NrF2 and HO-1) in cancer cells but not in normal cells. CM-EXOs have antibacterial and antifungal effects as well as a selective anticancer effect against HepG2 and CaCo2 cells with a higher safety margin on normal cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They have to be distinguished from cases of enteritis. Non-invasive biomarkers such as miRNAs would be a step towards faster diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate shifts in miRNA expression in tissue samples collected from cases of enteritis, carcinoma and lymphoma of the small and large intestine to better understand the potential of miRNA as biomarkers for tumour diagnosis and classification. We selected two oncogenic miRNAs (miR-18b and 20b), two tumour suppressive miRNAs (miR-192 and 194) and two potential biomarkers for neoplasms (miR-126 and 214). They were isolated from FFPE material, quantified by ddPCR, normalised with RNU6B and compared with normal tissue values. Our results confirmed that ddPCR is a suitable method for quantifying miRNA from FFPE material. Expression of miR-18b and miR-192 was higher in carcinomas of the small intestine than in those of the large intestine. Specific miRNA patterns were observed in cases of enteritis, B-cell and T-cell lymphoma and carcinoma. However, oncogenic miR-18b and 20b were not elevated in any group and miR-126 and 214 were down-regulated in T-cell and B-cell lymphoma, as well as in carcinomas and lymphoplasmacytic enteritis of the small intestine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 14-month-old, sexually intact, male, Lagotto dog with complete Y-type urethral duplication was subjected to accessory urethra treatment for cystoscopic guided laser cauterization, with a 10-Watt diode laser with 550-micron fiber and 2.3 Fr outer diameter. The laser cauterization, that was repeated every 14 days for a total of three times, was performed by inserting the instrument from the accessory urethra outlet in the perianal area until it could be seen by the urethroscope, inside the ischial urethra. Nevertheless, this technique that proved to be non-invasive, less expensive than surgery, of short duration, and safe, did not allow the complete closure of the abnormal urethral tract. Therefore, the subsequent surgical removal of the accessory urethra was carried out. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report on the use of cystoscopic guided diode laser cauterization for accessory urethra treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The diagnosis of hepatic lymphoma in humans relies on recognition of specific patterns of lymphocytic infiltrates and clonality testing of antigen receptors. Herein, we defined similar patterns of lymphocytic infiltrates in hepatic biopsies of cats and correlated them with clonality to determine which patterns are predictive of lymphoma. A retrospective study was performed on surgical biopsies from 44 cats. The immunophenotype was characterized using CD3 and CD20 on all 44 samples. All 44 samples were tested using PCR for T-cell receptor gamma-gene rearrangements. PCR for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements was performed on 24 of these cats. Four patterns of lymphocytic infiltrates were characterized: (1) tightly periportal, (2) periportal and centrilobular, (3) nodular, and (4) periportal with sinusoidal extension. Other histomorphologic features (fibrosis, biliary hyperplasia, bile ductopenia, bile duct targeting, hepatic hematopoiesis, lipogranulomas, lymphonodular aggregates, other inflammatory cells) were also evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the lymphocytic patterns to diagnose lymphomas were determined using Bayesian Hui-Walter analysis (BLCM) against clonality results. Lymphocytic patterns 2, 3, and 4 accurately diagnosed hepatic lymphomas with a sensitivity and specificity of 82% (CI 95%: 0.65, 0.96) and 77% (CI 95%: 0.54, 1.00), respectively. None of the other microscopic features evaluated were predictive of a lymphoma or inflammation. Our study identified specific patterns of lymphocytic infiltration that differentiate feline hepatic lymphoma from inflammation while other histologic features were not associated with an accurate diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

BC is rich in various amino acids, proteins, and fats essential for the nutrition of the neonate calves. Despite the evident beneficial effect of BC on calves, the effect of BC on blood biomarkers is poorly understood. Calves that received BC showed significantly higher body mass at days 7 and 30 (38.54 kg and 43.42 kg, respectively) compared to the colostrum replacer group (p = 0.0064). BC induced greater quantities of blood neutrophils (0.27 &#215; 10[9]/L) and monocytes (4.76 &#215; 10[9]/L) in comparison to the colostrum replacer (0.08 and 0.06 &#215; 10[9]/L, respectively) (p = 0.0001). Animals that received BC showed higher levels of total serum protein (59.16 g/L) and albumin (29.96 g/L) in comparison to the colostrum replacer group (44.34 g/L and 31.58 g/L, respectively). In addition, BC induced greater intestinal mucus production in the Wistar rat model. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BC is important for the growth of calves and that it provides a significant beneficial effect on morphological and biochemical blood parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The outbreak of pathogenic bacterial diseases causes high mortality rates and economic losses in Nile tilapia farming. Antibiotic administrations are commonly utilized to inhibit and prevent bacterial infections. However, antibiotics are expensive and cause serious concerns for antibiotic resistance in fish that can be potentially transferred to humans. As an alternative solution, probiotics can be used to prevent infection of pathogenic bacteria in fish. In this work, both bacteria and yeast were isolated from fish gastrointestinal tracts and their inhibitory activity against Nile tilapia pathogenic bacteria was evaluated, as well as other probiotic properties. In this study, 66 bacteria and 176 acid tolerant yeasts were isolated from fish gastrointestinal tracts. Of all isolated microorganisms, 39 bacterial and 15 yeast isolates with inhibitory effect against pathogens were then examined for their probiotic properties (acidic and bile salt resistance, adhesion potential, and biofilm formation), formation of antibacterial factor survival rate under simulated gastrointestinal fluid, and safety evaluation. AT8/5 bacterial isolate demonstrated probiotic properties and the highest inhibition against all 54 tested pathogens while YON3/2 yeast isolate outperformed the inhibitory effect among all yeast isolates. These two probiotic isolates were further identified by 16S rDNA and the D1/D2 domain of 26S rDNA sequence analysis for bacterial and yeast identification, respectively. AT8/5 and YON3/2 showed the highest similarity to Lactiplantibacillus argentoratensis and Candida tropicalis, respectively. This is the first report on isolated L. argentoratensis and C. tropicalis with antipathogenic bacteria of Nile tilapia properties. Collectively, AT8/5 and YON3/2 could be potentially used as promising alternatives to existing antibiotic methods to prevent pathogenic bacteria infection in Nile tilapia farming.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In animals, there is no study relating the influence of animals' work and their tactile reactivity per se. We investigated horses' tactile reactivity using von Frey filament in different body areas and compared horses working only in equine-assisted interventions (EAI), in riding school (RS) lessons, and in both activities (EAI-RS). We further compared tactile actions by people with or without mental and/or developmental disorders during brushing sessions. The results indicated that EAI horses showed higher tactile reactivity compared to EAI-RS and RS horses, both in terms of number of reactions overall, and especially when the test involved thin filaments. All horses showed high tactile reactivity when tested on the stifle, and this was particularly true for EAI horses. These differences could be related to humans' actions, as participants diagnosed with disorders brushed more the hindquarters and showed more fragmented actions. This study opens new lines of thought on the influence of EAI working activity on horses' tactile reactivity, and hence, on horses' sensory perception. Tactile reactivity outside work, may be directly (via tactile stimulations) or indirectly (via the welfare state), influenced by working conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Liver is the primary site for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), the major intracellular antioxidant. GSH erythrocyte concentration can decrease in case of liver damage. So, the use of food supplements with antioxidant capacity has been reported in the veterinary literature. In this case-control study, we tested a new supplement containing S-acetyl-glutathione (SAG), silybin, and other antioxidant ingredients in dogs affected by liver disease. After two weeks of supplement administration, we were able to report a significant increase in the level of erythrocyte GSH in the treated (TRT) group, nearly reaching the physiological limit at the end of the study. In addition, most of the key liver parameters are significantly reduced in the TRT group by the end of the trial. The results of this study support the effectiveness of the tested complementary feed, which may be helpful in managing dogs with liver conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As stress is suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of FIC, the effects of norepinephrine (NE) as a stress mediator were investigated on a novel feline primary uroepithelial cell culture, serving as an in vitro model of the disease. The uroepithelial cells gained from the mucosa of the bladder of a euthanized cat were cultured for 6 days and were acutely exposed to NE (10, 100, and 1000 &#181;M) for 1 h. NE increased the metabolic activity of the cultured cells and elevated the extracellular concentrations of the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6) and stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1), confirming that NE can trigger an inflammatory response in the uroepithelium. Cellular protein carbonyl levels were increased by NE exposure, while malondialdehyde and glucose regulated protein 78 concentrations remained unchanged, indicating that NE may provoke the oxidative damage of proteins without inducing lipid peroxidation or endoplasmic reticulum stress. Further, it can be strongly suggested that an acute NE challenge might diminish the barrier function of uroepithelial cells, as reflected by the decreased glycosaminoglycan concentration, claudin-4 protein expression, and reduced TER values of the NE-treated cell cultures. Based on these results, short-term NE exposure mimicking acute stress can provoke an inflammatory response and decrease the barrier integrity of cultured feline uroepithelial cells. Hence, it is highly expected that stress-associated NE release may play an important mediatory role in the pathogenesis of FIC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

PRV variants with high virulence were found to be the main cause of the outbreaks. In the face of the PRV epidemic, detection of the wild strain is as important as vaccine immunization, so we hoped to achieve differential diagnosis of PRV by obtaining a monoclonal antibody (mAB) that could be used to identify the wild strain. In this study, we used a novel immunization and screening strategy to prepare an mAB and obtained mAB 1H5 against the gE glycoprotein. An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that this mAB was specific to both classic and variant strains of PRV. Subsequently, we further identified the linear epitopes of B cells recognized using the mAB. The mAB 1H5 bound at [67]RRAG[70], which is a novel epitope and is conserved in almost all PRV strains. These findings provide novel insight into the structure and function of PRV proteins, the analysis of antigenic epitope characteristics, and the establishment of antigen or antibody detection methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study included a total of 100 LBW piglets that were divided into 5 groups (20 LBW piglets per group) and treated with IM Dexa alone or in combination with vitamin E/Se (Vit E/Se) after birth as follows: (a) Group A-Cont: Control group, (b) Group B-Dexa1: Dexa on D1 (1st day of life), (c) Group C-Dexa3: Dexa on D1, D2, D3 (D2: 2nd day of life, D3: 3rd day of life), (d) Group D-Dexa + VitE/S1: Dexa + Vit E/Se on D1, and (e) Group E-Dexa + VitE/S3: Dexa + Vit E/Se (IM) on D1, D2, D3. Body weight (BW) and the Average Daily Weight Gain (ADWG) were recorded for all piglets on days 1, 7, 14, and 25, and vitality score (VS) was recorded on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 14. A significant increase in BW and ADWG in Group E-Dexa + VitE/S3 and a significant reduction in Group C-Dexa3 were noticed in comparison to other groups. VS in groups Group B-Dexa1 and Group C-Dexa3 were significantly lower in comparison to other groups. Furthermore, piglets of Group C-Dexa3 had a significantly higher frequency of clinical findings compared to other groups. In conclusion, the administration of Dexa and vitamin E/Se combined after the birth of LBW piglets for 1-3 days has beneficial effects on their growth and survival scores.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To determine whether the therapeutic effect of Mutian on dry and mixed FIP can be predicted using clinical indicators before starting treatment, we entered 161 cats with mixed FIP and 163 cats with dry FIP into this study. Physical assessments, the reverse transcriptase-PCR detection of viral genes, and clinical laboratory tests (hematocrit, albumin/globulin ratio, serum amyloid A, &#945;1-acid glycoprotein, and total bilirubin) were performed before Mutian was administered. These indicators were compared between the FIP groups that survived after receiving Mutian for 84 days and those that died before the completion of treatment. Significant differences in body temperature, appetite, and activity scores were confirmed between the surviving and non-surviving groups. The therapeutic effect was insufficient when total bilirubin levels increased in cats with the mixed form. In both of the FIP types, therapeutic effects were difficult to obtain when neurological clinical signs were observed. The therapeutic effects of Mutian on the cats with dry and mixed FIP can be predicted based on pre-treatment body temperature, appetite scores, and activity scores, as well as the presence of neurological signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Yet, the influence of light on nursery pigs is not fully understood and results remain controversial. The present study investigated the effects of a prolonged photoperiod on the performance, health, and behaviour of nursery pigs. This study was conducted in one farm and included 288 hybrid nursery pigs. Long (LONG) and short (SHORT) photoperiod animals were exposed to either 16 or 8 h of light per day, respectively. Performance, health, welfare, and behavioural parameters were monitored during a nursery period of five weeks. Short photoperiod piglets tended to have higher weights at the end of the nursery (LONG: 21.59 vs. SHORT: 22.19 kg; p = 0.064) and higher average daily gain (LONG: 385 vs. SHORT: 403 g/day; p = 0.063) compared to the long photoperiod piglets. The LONG piglets had significantly higher fecal consistency scores (0-100) than the SHORT piglets on days 7 (LONG: 21 vs. SHORT: 10; p = 0.039), 11 (LONG: 40 vs. SHORT: 14; p = 0.002), 21 (LONG: 21 vs. SHORT: 8; p = 0.008), and 25 (LONG: 26 vs. SHORT: 11; p = 0.015). The LONG piglets tended to have a slightly higher incidence of aggressive behaviour (LONG: 2.49% vs. SHORT: 2.36%; p = 0.071). No significant differences were found for the remaining parameters (p &gt; 0.1). Under the present conditions, lengthening the photoperiod during the nursery period did not significantly improve the performance, health, and welfare of the pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Significant differences (p &lt; 0.004) in iron content were found between C. vulgaris, which had the highest (1347 &#177; 93 &#956;g g[-1]), and H. pluvialis, which had the lowest (216 &#177; 59 &#956;g g[-1]) iron content. C. vulgaris, A. platensis, and H. pluvialis showed an iron bioaccessibility of 30, 31, and 30%, respectively, while P. tricornutum showed the lowest bioaccessibility (11%). The four species analysed presented soluble iron mainly bound to proteins with high molecular mass ranging from &gt;75 to 40 kDa. C. vulgaris showed the highest iron content associated with good bioaccessibility; therefore, it could be considered to be an interesting natural source of organic iron in dog nutrition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clinical evaluation revealed a minimally dilated cervix on vaginal examination, with a palpable deceased fetus. Postmortem evaluation following owner-elected humane euthanasia revealed a circumferential, tan, fibrous band at the base of the uterine body that constricted the uterus and was adhered to the left and right ovaries. A routine histologic section of the incarcerating cord attached to the ovary consisted predominately of dense fibrous connective tissue, large blood vessels, and a central oviduct suggestive of a rent in the broad ligament. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report to describe uterine body constriction that precluded vaginal delivery of a fetus in a late gestation mare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851444</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Detection and Phylogenetic Analysis of Deformed Wing Virus and Sacbrood Virus Isolated from Pollen.</Title>	<Abstract>Among many pathogens and pests, honey bee viruses are known as one of the most common cause of diseases in honey bee colonies. In this study, we demonstrate that pollen grains and bee bread are potential sources of viral DNA. We extracted DNA from 3 types of pollen samples: directly provided by beekeepers (n = 12), purchased from trade markets (n = 5), and obtained from honeycombs (bee bread, n = 10). The extracted DNA was used for molecular detection (RT-PCR analysis) of six of the most widely distributed honey bee viruses: deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus, acute bee paralysis virus, black queen cell virus, Kashmir bee virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, and chronic bee paralysis virus. We successfully managed to establish only the deformed wing virus (DWV) and the sacbrood virus (SBV), with different distribution frequencies depending on the territory of the country. The phylogenetic analyses of Bulgarian isolates were performed with the most similar sequences available in molecular databases from other countries. Phylogenies of Bulgarian viral strains demonstrated genetically heterogeneous populations of DWV and relatively homogenous populations of SBV. In conclusion, the results obtained from the current study have shown that pollen is a valuable source for molecular detection of honey bee pathogens. This allows epidemiological monitoring of honey bee diseases at a regional and a national level.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two sets of primers and probes for the CPIV5 L and canine 16S rRNA genes were included in the dqRT-PCR assay to detect CPIV and monitor invalid results throughout the qRT-PCR process. The developed dqRT-PCR assay specifically detected CPIV5 but no other canine pathogens. Furthermore, 16S rRNA was stably amplified by dqRT-PCR assay in all samples containing canine cellular materials. The assay's sensitivity was determined as below ten RNA copies per reaction, with CPIV5 L gene standard RNA and 1 TCID50/mL with the CPIV5 D008 vaccine strain, which was 10-fold higher than that of the previous HN gene-specific qRT-PCR (HN-qRT-PCR) assays and was equivalent to that of the previous N gene-specific qRT-PCR (N-qRT-PCR) assays, respectively. Moreover, the Ct values of the CPIV5-positive samples obtained using the dqRT-PCR assay were lower than those obtained using the previous HN- and N-qRT-PCR assays, indicating that the diagnostic performance of the dqRT-PCR assay was superior to those of previous HN- and N-qRT-PCR assays. The calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient values (95% confidence interval) between dqRT-PCR and the HN- or N-specific qRT-PCR assays were 0.97 (0.90-1.03) or 1.00 (1.00-1.00), respectively. In conclusion, the newly developed dqRT-PCR assay with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability will be a promising diagnostic tool for the detection of CPIV5 in clinical samples and useful for etiological and epidemiological studies of CPIV5 infection in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a severe zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete that causes relapsing fever (RF) and is genetically related to Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. However, there have been no reports of B. miyamotoi in Egypt, and the data on LB in camels is scarce. Thus, the present study was conducted to screen and genetically identify Borrelia spp. and B. miyamotoi in Egyptian camels and associated ticks using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 133 blood samples and 1596 adult hard ticks were collected from Camelus dromedaries at Cairo and Giza slaughterhouses in Egypt. Tick species were identified by examining their morphology and sequencing the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. Borrelia spp. was detected using nested PCR on the IGS (16S-23S) gene, and positive samples were genotyped using 16S rRNA and glpQ spp. genes specific for Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia miyamotoi, respectively. The positive PCR products were sequenced and analyzed by phylogenetic tree.</Abstract><Abstract>Analysis of the cox1 gene sequence revealed that the adult ticks belonged to three genera; Hyalomma (H), Amblyomma (Am), and Rhipicephalus (R), as well as 12 species, including H. dromedarii, H. marginatum, H. excavatum, H. anatolicum, R. annulatus, R. pulchellus, Am. testudinarium, Am. hebraeum, Am. lipidium, Am. variegatum, Am. cohaerens and Am. gemma. Borrelia spp. was found in 8.3% (11/133) of the camel blood samples and 1.3% (21/1596) of the ticks, respectively. Sequencing of the IGS (16S-23S) gene found that B. afzelii, detected from H. dromedarii and H. marginatum, and B. crocidurae, which belongs to the RF group, was detected from one blood sample. B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi were discovered in the blood samples and tick species. Phylogenetic analysis of the glpQ gene showed that the B. miyamotoi in this study was of the Asian and European types.</Abstract><Abstract>These results suggest that the camels can be infected by Lyme borrelia and other Borrelia bacteria species. This study also provides the first insight into the presence of Borrelia miyamotoi and B. afzelii DNA in camels and associated ticks in Egypt.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851447</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Chrysoeriol Improves In Vitro Porcine Embryo Development by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Autophagy.</Title>	<Abstract>Chrysoeriol (CHE) is a flavonoid substance that exists in many plants. It has various physiological and pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and protective activity, especially for the cardiovascular system and liver. Among common livestock embryos, porcine embryos are often considered high-quality objects for studying the antioxidant mechanisms of oocytes. Because porcine embryos contain high levels of lipids, they are more vulnerable to external stimuli, which affect development. Our study explored the influence of CHE supplementation on oxidative stress in porcine oocytes and its possible mechanisms. Different concentrations of CHE (0, 0.1, 1, and 3 &#181;M) were supplemented in the in vitro culture medium of the porcine oocytes. The results showed that supplementation with 1 &#181;M CHE significantly increased the blastocyst rate and total cell number of embryos in vitro. After finding the beneficial effects of CHE, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) when the oocytes reached the 4-cell stage of development and determined the levels of apoptosis, cell proliferation, and autophagy at the blastocyst stage of development. The expression levels of some related genes were preliminarily detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the apoptosis of blastocysts in the CHE-treated culture also decreased compared with the untreated culture. Furthermore, CHE downregulated intracellular ROS and increased GSH in the embryos. CHE was also shown to improve the activity of mitochondria and inhibit the occurrence of autophagy. In addition, antioxidant-related genes (SOD1, SOD2, and CAT) and cell pluripotency-related genes (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) were upregulated. At the same time, apoptosis-related (Caspase 3) and autophagy-related (LC3B) genes showed a downward trend after supplementation with CHE. These results indicate that CHE improved the development of porcine embryos in vitro by reducing oxidative stress and autophagy levels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Guinea pigs have been proposed as a good model to study fetal development and related gestational complications; however, longitudinal growth and blood flow changes in utero have not been properly described. This study aimed to describe fetal and placental growth and blood flow of the main intrauterine vascular beds across normal guinea pig pregnancy and to discuss the relevance of this data for human pregnancy.</Abstract><Abstract>Pregnant guinea pigs were studied from day 25 of pregnancy until term (day ~70) by ultrasound and Doppler assessment. The results were compared to human data from the literature.</Abstract><Abstract>Measurements of biparietal diameter (BPD), cranial circumference (CC), abdominal circumference, and placental biometry, as well as pulsatility index determination of umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery (MCA), and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR), were feasible to determine across pregnancy, and they could be adjusted to linear or nonlinear functions. In addition, several of these parameters showed a high correlation coefficient and could be used to assess gestational age in guinea pigs. We further compared these data to ultrasound variables from human pregnancy with high similarities.</Abstract><Abstract>BPD and CC are the most reliable measurements to assess fetal growth in guinea pigs. Furthermore, this is the first report in which the MCA pulsatility index and CPR are described across guinea pig gestation. The guinea pig is a valuable model to assess fetal growth and blood flow distribution, variables that are comparable with human pregnancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Breast cancer 2, early onset (BRCA2) malignant mutations are associated with tumorigenesis in humans and dogs. BRCA2 plays a pivotal role in homologous recombination repair by recruiting RAD51 recombinase to DNA damage sites to maintain genome stability. To recruit RAD51, BRCA2 must interact with RAD51 via BRC repeats, but the regulation of this interaction has been unclear. In this study, we focused on a highly conserved region (HCR) near BRC repeats. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assay, we found that HCR suppressed the RAD51-interaction activity of BRC repeats and that substitutions of HCR phosphorylation sites affected it. In canine tumor samples, we found ten mutations, including a novel HCR mutation (I1110M) from canine tumor samples. The effect of four HCR mutations, including I1110M, on the RAD51-interaction activity of BRC repeats was tested. One of the HCR mutations found in canine mammary tumors increased the interaction, but the two mutations found in human breast cancers decreased it. This study suggested that the HCR regulated the RAD51-interacting activity of BRC repeats through HCR phosphorylation and that mutations in HCR may be related to tumorigenesis in both dogs and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851450</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Environment in Veterinary Education.</Title>	<Abstract>Environmental concerns have become priority issues over the last third of the 20th century. The EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) has gone from rules which supported the farming sector after years of famine to being oriented towards looking at environmental aspects. Therefore, it has evolved not only to react to a changing market and consumer demands but also to respond to climate change and the need for sustainable development. Environmental education is an important pillar for responding and adapting to climate change. The CAP policies oriented towards optimizing the use of natural resources, residue management, antimicrobial use reduction, the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and animal welfare need linked educational programs. In this context, veterinarians, being experts in animal production, welfare, and food safety and its technology and public health under the One Health concept, are scarcely informed in environmental aspects, which would help them to understand and face the consequences of climate change in the rural world. Future veterinarians must be able to quantify the effects of animal production on the environment, optimizing the use of natural resources, minimizing GHG emissions, and managing the risks associated with climate change by using different analysis tools that need to be included in their learning programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aims of this study were (1) to investigate KITLG CNV in giant (GS), standard (SS), and miniature (MS) schnauzers and (2) to compare KITLG CNV between black GS with and without dSCC. Blood samples from black GS (22 with and 17 without dSCC), black SS (18 with and 4 without dSSC; 5 unknown), and 50 MS (unknown dSSC status and coat colour) were analysed by digital droplet PCR. The results are that (1) most dogs had a copy number (CN) value &gt; 4 (range 2.5-7.6) with no significant differences between GS, SS, and MS, and (2) the CN value in black GS with dSCC was significantly higher than in those without dSCC (p = 0.02). CN values &gt; 5.8 indicate a significantly increased risk for dSCC, while CN values &lt; 4.7 suggest a reduced risk for dSCC (grey area: 4.7-5.8). Diagnostic testing for KITLG CNV may sensitise owners to the individual risk of their black GS for dSCC. Further studies should investigate the relevance of KITLG CNV in SS and the protective effects in MS, who rarely suffer from dSCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study was conducted to determine the acceptance and eating enthusiasm in dogs with cancer for a new therapeutic, nutritionally balanced, and calorically dense food designed for dogs with cancer. Adult dogs with diagnosis of cancer were recruited from general and oncology practices and were fed the study food for 28 days. Evaluations included physical examination, body weight, food intake, caloric intake, hematology and serum biochemistry, and owner assessments, namely food evaluation, quality of life, and stool scores. The dogs transitioned smoothly and tolerated the food very well. The results showed high food acceptance within the first day, with continued eating enthusiasm over the 28 days. Significant increases in food and caloric intake were observed, with the study food having a positive impact on body weight in dogs that were losing weight and helping to maintain a high quality of life. Blood laboratory parameters remained within reference ranges. Thus, the therapeutic study food was well accepted and efficacious in supporting continued eating and required caloric intake, promoting a healthy weight gain and maintaining a high quality of life in dogs with cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In a 50 dairy cow Belgian herd, the farmer reported excessive uterine bleeding at calving and decreased milk production. Dairy cows received a mixed ration (MR) with high Al concentration (453 ppm/kg of dry matter (DM)). Various analyses were sampled from 10 sick cows and compared with 10 healthy cows (from another herd). Sick cows presented anaemia and marginal hypozincaemia and 6/10 showed subclinical ketosis. Their urine analysis revealed hypomagnesaemia and a high Al/creatinine ratio. It was advised to determine soil pH, add salts to the ration to chelate the Al and support cows with mineral supplements and propylene glycol. A visit was carried out 2 years later and highlighted an improvement in the situation, but all examined animals presented subclinical ketosis. Grass silage Al content remained high (700 ppm/kg DM), as did butyric acid concentration (11.22 g/kg DM). Al could be incriminated at different stages: micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia and negative energy balance. However, Al was probably not the only culprit. This case report is a concern for future years in these areas due to droughts, scarcity of forage and an increase in contaminated soil ingestion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The second dog's fecal incontinence was associated with the anal mass. In both dogs, reconstruction of the external anal sphincter was required to gain fecal continence. Especially in the dog with an anal mass, the whole musculature involved in fecal continence was removed with the affected anorectum. Conventional surgical treatments for fecal incontinence have limitations in terms of muscle flap length and complexity of the surgical procedure. A modified surgical technique using the semitendinosus muscle was devised in the present study to overcome these limitations. The distal part of the semitendinosus muscle was bifurcated to make two muscle bundles, used to completely encircle the anorectum. These muscle bundles were sutured to the surrounding rectal muscle and the pelvic diaphragm to simulate the function of the external anal sphincter. Three months after surgery, both dogs showed significantly improved fecal continence without severe complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or lameness of the limb where the semitendinosus muscle was harvested. The outcomes of the two dogs supported the acceptability of the bifurcated muscle flap for anal sphincter augmentation. In addition, this report showed the possibility of more diverse applications of semitendinosus muscle in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is especially true for the United States, where the average intake of chicken meat increased from 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person in 1940 to 65.2 pounds (29.6 kg) per person in 2018, while the country produced 113 billion eggs in 2019 alone. Besides providing nutrition and contributing significantly to the economy, chicken is also a natural reservoir of Salmonella, which is responsible for salmonellosis in humans, one of the significant foodborne illnesses around the globe. The increasing use of chicken manure and antibiotics increases the spread of Salmonella and selects for multi-drug resistant strains. Various plant extracts, primarily essential oils, have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. The multiple ways through which these plant-derived compounds exert their antimicrobial effects make the development of resistance against them unlikely. Eugenol, an aromatic oil primarily found in clove and cinnamon, has shown antimicrobial activities against various pathogenic bacteria. A few reports have also highlighted the anti-Salmonella effects of eugenol in chicken, especially in reducing the colonization by Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium, the primary Salmonella species responsible for human salmonellosis. Besides limiting Salmonella infection in chicken, the supplementation of eugenol also significantly improves intestinal health, improving overall well-being. In this review, we highlight the rising incidences of salmonellosis worldwide and the factors increasing its prevalence. We then propose the usage of eugenol as a natural feed supplement for containing Salmonella in chicken.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Considering that vaccination is currently the main modality for the prevention of ND, it is essential to assess the effectiveness of clinical immunization. In this study, we have developed a blocking lateral flow assay (bLFA) strip for the rapid detection of NDV antibodies using the monoclonal antibody 9C1 against haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), which allows for the determination of an NDV-specific antibody titer within 10 min at room temperature. In addition, the bLFA strip has no cross-reactivity with the positive serum of other avian pathogens including avian influenza subtypes H5, H7, and H9, MD, IBD, IB, EDS, and avian adenovirus. The ability of the bLFA strip for detecting a neutralizing antibody was also estimated. The results showed that the chicken NDV hyperimmunized serum had a complete blocking (100%) titer of 11 log 2, and half-blocking titer of 13 log 2, which are 4 times less than and the same as that of the HI test (13 log 2), and 8 and 2 times less than that of the VN test (14 log 2), respectively. A total of 510 clinical samples were tested for NDV antibodies. The coincidence rate between the results of the bLFA strip and HI test was 97.65%. Therefore, it is an ideal alternative method for assessing the clinical immunity of ND vaccines in the field in real-time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to highlight the usefulness of cryopreserved, air-dried cytological samples in detecting cytokeratin and vimentin. Air-dried cytological smear samples were prepared from a total of 39 resected canine tumors and stored in a medical freezer without fixation. The duration of cryopreservation ranged from 2 to 56 months. The same tumors were processed for routine histopathological examination. Based on the morphological diagnosis, cryopreserved FNA smears from epithelial tumors were stained by enzymatic immunocytochemistry (ICC) for cytokeratin; those from mesenchymal and melanocytic tumors were stained by ICC for vimentin. To ascertain the positivity of tumor cells to the selected markers, tissue paraffin-embedded sections were also stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the same markers. Immunoreactivity for cytokeratin was detected in cryopreserved cytological smears for a maximum of 46 months. Immunoreactivity for vimentin was clearly detected for 33 months. Smears stored at room temperature for 1 week did not show any signals under immunocytochemical examination. Thus, immunocytochemistry for cytokeratin and vimentin can be safely applied to air-dried smears cryopreserved in a freezer for at least 33 months.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are among the most important PRRs being expressed on and in a wide range of immune cell types. Studies on the interaction mechanisms between different pathogen species and the immune system of the dromedary camel are still scarce. The present study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of synthetic bacterial and viral TLR ligands on some phenotypic properties and selected functions of neutrophils purified from dromedary camel blood. Neutrophils were separated from camel blood (n = five animals) and were stimulated in vitro with the TLR ligands LPS, Pam3CSK4, R848 (Resiquimod), and Poly IC or were left without stimulation. Stimulation with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as a positive control stimulation. Shape change, phagocytosis activity, ROS production, the expression of cell surface markers, and cell vitality were compared between stimulated and non-stimulated cells. With exception of the TLR3 agonist Poly IC, all TLR ligands used showed the potential to stimulate camel neutrophils resulting in increased cell size and the upregulation of CD18 and CD14 on their surface. Similarly, the phagocytosis activity of camel neutrophils was significantly improved after priming with all TLR ligands, except Poly IC, which, in contrast, resulted in a reduced percentage of phagocytosis-positive cells. In contrast to stimulation with PMA, which induced a significant ROS production in camel neutrophils, none of the TLR ligands used stimulated ROS generation in neutrophils. Only stimulation with Pam3CSK4 increased the expression of MHCII molecules on camel neutrophils, resulting in an expanded MHCII[high] fraction within camel neutrophils. Our study indicates selective immunomodulating effects of TLR agonists on purified camel neutrophils without affecting their vitality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency has caused early mortality in salmonids; however, the thiamine status of Oregon's steelhead populations is unknown, to date. Of the 26 egg samples from three Oregon hatcheries in 2019, 20 (77%) had thiamine levels &lt; 10 nmol/g, and 13 of those samples (50%) had levels &lt;6.5 nmol/g, suggesting the thiamine deficiency of adult, female steelhead. To investigate if thiamine deficiency was causally related to fry survival, females were injected with buffered thiamine HCl 50 mg/kg prior to spawning; additionally, a subset of eggs were supplemented via bath treatment with thiamine mononitrate (1000 ppm) at spawning. Cumulative fry mortality at 8 weeks post-hatch from thiamine-injected females was 2.9% compared to 13.8% mortality of fry without thiamine supplementation. Fry treated only with the thiamine via bath as eggs had a mortality rate of 6.9%. There were no additional improvements for the survival of fry from injected females that also received a thiamine bath. Furthermore, condition factors were greater in thiamine-supplemented fry than in those that received no thiamine. These data identify thiamine deficiency in Oregon steelhead and suggest supplementation with thiamine can mitigate early rearing mortality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine brucellosis seroprevalence and risk factors among smallholder dairy cattle across six regions in Tanzania. We sampled 2048 dairy cattle on 1374 farms between July 2019 and October 2020. Sera were tested for the presence of anti-Brucella antibodies using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence was calculated at different administrative scales, and spatial tests were used to detect disease hotspots. A generalized mixed-effects regression model was built to explore the relationships among Brucella serostatus, animals, and farm management factors. Seroprevalence was 2.39% (49/2048 cattle, 95% CI 1.7-3.1) across the study area and the Njombe Region represented the highest percentage with 15.5% (95% CI 11.0-22.0). Moreover, hotspots were detected in the Njombe and Kilimanjaro Regions. Mixed-effects models showed that having goats (OR 3.02, 95% C 1.22-7.46) and abortion history (OR 4.91, 95% CI 1.43-16.9) were significant risk factors for brucellosis. Education of dairy farmers regarding the clinical signs, transmission routes, and control measures for brucellosis is advised. A One Health approach is required to study the role of small ruminants in cattle brucellosis and the status of brucellosis in dairy farmers in the Njombe and Kilimanjaro Regions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A comparison with matched cell blocks (CB) is missing. Immunolabeling on RSC and CB was compared for lymphoid markers (CD3 and PAX5) in 53 lymphomas and 4 chylous effusions from dogs and cats. The influence of pre-analytical variables (species, time of archive, type of specimens and coverslipping) and the interobserver agreement among the 2 observers was assessed. Fewer CD3+ lymphocytes were identified in RSC, while the PAX5 positivity by RSC and CB had a substantial agreement. Immunodetection of CD3 and the diagnosis of a T-cell population on RSC was more difficult. Lower intensity and higher background were noted in RSC. Immunophenotyping was inconclusive in 54% RSC and 19% CB. The interobserver reproducibility of immunophenotyping on CB was substantial, being higher than in RSC. The immunolabeling performance on the RSC of effusion and feline samples was unsatisfactory. The detection of lymphoid markers, especially membranous antigens in retrospective RSC, is affected by the pre-analytical variables: species, time of the archive, and type of specimens. CB are a more consistent type of sample for immunophenotyping purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eleven baboons received tiletamine-zolazepam and medetomidine; anesthesia was induced with propofol. An LMA was positioned for oxygen and isoflurane administration in spontaneous respiration. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), minute volume (MV), and peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded before (PREPP) and immediately after abdomen insufflation (PP1), at 10 (PP2), 20 (PP3), and 30 (PP4) minutes during pneumoperitoneum, and after (POSTPP) pneumoperitoneum. The respiratory rate was significantly higher at all times compared to PREPP. The end tidal carbon dioxide concentration was significantly higher at PP2, PP3, PP4, and POSTPP, compared to the previous times. The higher values for RR and EtCO2 were registered at PP4: 22.7 (95% CI 17.6-27.8) breaths/min and 57.9 (95% CI 51.9-63.8) mmHg, respectively. The minute volume was significantly higher at PP4 and POSTPP compared to the other times. The higher value for MV was registered at POSTPP (269.1 (95% CI 206.1-331.8) mL/kg/min). This protocol is suitable for baboons undergoing laparoscopic salpingectomy. The LMA was easy to insert and allowed for good ventilation, gas exchange, and delivery of the anesthetic in spontaneous breathing baboons.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Riociguat induces endothelium-independent pulmonary artery (PA) relaxation by directly activating the sGC-cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in muscle cells. Although riociguat may be effective in the treatment of dogs with refractory PH, basic studies on its clinical application in veterinary medicine are lacking. The present study aimed to explore the effects of riociguat on the contractility of an isolated canine PA and the hemodynamics of dogs with acute PH. In an isolated endothelium-denuded canine PA, the effects of riociguat on endothelin (ET)-1-induced contraction and cGMP levels were investigated using the Magnus method and ELISA, respectively. The effect of riociguat on the hemodynamics of the thromboxane A2 analog U46619-induced PH model dog was examined by invasive catheterization. Riociguat increased cGMP levels and reduced ET-1-induced contraction of the isolated PA. Riociguat inhibited the U46619-induced elevation of PA pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and increased cardiac output, but it had no effect on basal systemic blood pressure. These results demonstrate for the first time that riociguat can inhibit the elevation of PA pressure through PA relaxation via an endothelium-independent increase in cGMP in dogs with PH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Such connections develop in utero and persist postnatally. CPSS are among the two most common congenital vascular anomalies of the liver in small animals, along with primary hypoplasia of the portal vein without portal hypertension (PHPV without PH). CPSS can be extrahepatic (ECPSS), most commonly diagnosed in small and toy breed dogs and cats, or intrahepatic (ICPSS), most commonly seen in large breed dogs. Single ECPSS is the most common type encountered in both dogs and cats. Clinical signs of CPSS are non-specific and may wax and wane, while laboratory findings can raise clinical suspicion for CPSS, but they are also not specific. Definitive diagnosis will be established by evaluation of liver function tests, such as determination of fasting plasma ammonia (FA) levels, and pre- and postprandial serum bile acids concentrations, and diagnostic imaging. The purpose of this article is to review the definition, classification, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of CPSS in dogs and cats, highlighted by the authors' clinical experience.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Resource Shortages and Decision-Making in Veterinary Medicine-A Vignette Study with German Veterinary Students.</Title>	<Abstract>The here presented vignette study was part of a survey on ethical judgement skills among advanced veterinary students at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation. The vignette describes a fictitious dilemma in veterinary practice due to medication supply shortages. First, the students should make an ethically justified decision: who of the two patients in the waiting room gets the last dosage of a medication. Important factors were the animal patients' characteristics (age, state of health, life expectancy), the patient owners' wellbeing, and context-related criteria. Second, the students were asked for decisional changes if one of the patients was their own dog. They reacted in four different ways: (1) for a professional, this should not make a difference; (2) most likely being "egoistic" and preferring their own dog; (3) giving the medication to the other dog; and (4) avoiding a decision. Finally, the students judged a list of possible solutions to the dilemma on a 9-point scale. They preferred patient-related criteria to patient-owner-related criteria in this task. In the overall results, it became obvious that no "gold standard" or guidelines for situations of medication shortages exist, yet, which presents an important subject for future research and veterinary ethics teaching.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(2) Methods: 45 dogs divided into three groups were first given premium dry food for 38 days (baseline). The O3I was then used as a diagnostic tool to provide a measure of the sum of EPA + DHA in red blood cell membranes given as a percentage of all fatty acids. The dogs were subsequently fed with either krill meal (krill), fishmeal/oil (fish) or flaxseed cake (flax) included in raw food providing daily 416 mg EPA + DHA (971 mg ALA), 513 mg EPA + DHA (1027 mg ALA) and 1465 mg ALA (122 mg EPA + DHA), respectively. (3) Results: the average baseline O3I level of all dogs was low (1.36%), warranting n-3 supplementation. After four weeks, O3I levels were significantly increased in the krill (from 1.36 &#177; 0.44 to 2.36 &#177; 0.39%) and fish (from 1.35 &#177; 0.22 to 1.9 &#177; 0.35%) groups (p &lt; 0.001). No significant modification of the O3I was detected in the flax animals. (4) Conclusions: only marine n-3 PUFAs resulted in a significantly increased O3I, with dietary krill meal providing the highest increase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Of the animals with neoplasms studied, cattle were affected in 69.80% of cases, goats in 10.52%, sheep in 10.46%, and swine in 9.18%. In all species, the most frequent neoplasms were squamous cell carcinomas in ruminants, while melanoma was the most frequent in swine. Few studies carried out in slaughterhouses were found, and the existing ones referred to cattle and swine. No data were found on economic losses with carcass condemnation.</Abstract><Abstract>In view of the above, it is necessary to carry out extensive and detailed studies that provide knowledge about the impact of neoplasms on the production and condemnation of carcasses in domestic cattle, sheep, goats, and swine and the respective risk factors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851468</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Topographical Anatomy of the Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta)-Part I: Thoracic Limb.</Title>	<Abstract>Since the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) is genetically closely related to man, it is generally accepted that its anatomy and physiology are largely similar to that of humans. Consequently, this non-human primate is most commonly used as a model in biomedical research. Not only the validation of the obtained research data, but also the welfare of the captive rhesus monkeys are subject to thorough anatomical knowledge of this species. Unfortunately, anatomical literature on the rhesus monkey is scarce, outdated, and hardly available at present. Furthermore, its anatomy is only illustrated by means of line drawings or black-and-white photographs. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the anatomy of the thoracic limb of the rhesus monkey topographically, studying the various anatomical structures in relation to each other. In this manuscript, the anatomy of the thoracic limb is described per region. The structures that are visible on the different layers, from the superficial to the deepest layer, are described both in text and in numerous color images. As expected, the anatomy of the rhesus monkey is almost identical to human anatomy. However, some striking differences have been identified. This supports the necessity for an extensive publication on the anatomy of the rhesus monkey.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To explore this, we conducted histopathologic and proteomic analyses on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples from five cases of APAB (three dogs and two cats). Histologically, the samples exhibited a proliferation of the odontogenic epithelium, with moderate to severe interstitial amyloid deposits. By using Congo red and polarized light, the amyloid deposits were found to show characteristic birefringence. Amyloid deposits were dissected from tissue sections and analyzed by LC/MS/MS, and high levels of ameloblastin were detected in all tissues. Mass spectrometry also revealed that the N-terminal region of ameloblastin is predominantly present in amyloid deposits. Immunohistochemistry was performed using two anti-ameloblastin (N terminal, middle region) antibodies and showed that amyloid deposits were positive for ameloblastin N terminal but negative for ameloblastin middle region. These results suggest that ameloblastin is the amyloid precursor protein of APABs in dogs and cats, and the N-terminal region may be involved in the amyloidogenesis of ameloblastin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Breed-specific VHSs, in most cases, were different from the original reference value. Characteristics of the thoracic vertebrae and IVS may influence this variation. This study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of the T4 and IVS on the thoracic radiographs of Corgis in comparison with other small-to-medium breed dogs to evaluate the Corgi-specific VHSs in healthy dogs. The ratio of the T4's length/height (T4L/H) was significantly different among dog breeds but not the IVS between the T4 and T5. The T4L/H was highest in the Shih Tzu and lowest in Beagle dogs. The Corgi-specific VHS obtained from the ventrodorsal radiograph was significantly higher than that from the dorsoventral radiograph, but a significant difference was not observed between the right and left lateral radiographs. In contrast, the Corgi-specific VHS derived from the right lateral thoracic radiograph was significantly lower than the reference value. This may be correlated with the characteristics of the thoracic vertebrae of Corgis, which were slightly higher than those of the other breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The slaughterhouse can be used as surveillance center for livestock diseases. However, other aspects related with animal and human health, such as epidemiology and disease control in primary production, control of animal welfare on the farm, surveillance of zoonotic agents responsible for food poisoning, as well as surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance, can be monitored. These controls should not be seen as a last defensive barrier but rather as a complement to the controls carried out on the farm. Regarding the control of diseases in livestock, scientific research is scarce and outdated, not taking advantage of the potential for disease control. Animal welfare in primary production and during transport can be monitored throughout ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection at the slaughterhouse, providing valuable individual data on animal welfare. Surveillance and research regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at slaughterhouses is scarce, mainly in cattle, sheep, and goats. However, most of the zoonotic pathogens are sensitive to the antibiotics studied. Moreover, the prevalence at the slaughterhouse of zoonotic and foodborne agents seems to be low, but a lack of harmonization in terms of control and communication may lead to underestimate its real prevalence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The clinical use of ivermectin on chinchillas has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of our study was to assess the influence of ivermectin injection on the fecal bacterial microbiota of chinchillas. A with-in subject, before and after study was performed on 10 clinically healthy chinchillas during a 14-day period, all chinchillas received the same ivermectin treatment, and the microbiota from their fecal samples before and after administration were compared as two experimental groups. Fecal samples were collected on day 0 (before ivermectin administration) and day 14 (post ivermectin administration). Fecal bacterial microbiota was analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No clinical abnormalities were observed post subcutaneous administration of ivermectin. No significant alteration was found in the abundance and diversity of fecal bacterial microbiota after treatment, but the dominant position of some bacterial species changed. In conclusion, ivermectin administration was associated with minimal alternations of the fecal bacterial microbiota in healthy chinchillas, and these changes had no observed negative effect on general health of chinchillas in short term.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Meningomyelitis of Unknown Origin (MUO) was presumptively diagnosed based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The dog received a tapering dose of glucocorticoids and cyclosporine, showing significant improvement and the stabilization of the clinical signs for seven months. After this period, the dog showed an acute clinical deterioration and a follow-up MRI revealed new multiple lesions affecting different spinal nerve roots along the cervicothoracic spinal cord. Following euthanasia, a final diagnose of multiple malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) was made based on the histopathological examination. MPNSTs can affect the cranial nerves, spinal nerves or the associated nerve roots at any location and can lead to secondary spinal cord compression. The aim of the present case report is to describe the clinical presentation and atypical MRI findings of a dog with histologically confirmed multiple MPNSTs. According to the reviewed literature, this is the first reported case of simultaneous MPNSTs in the cervicothoracic spinal cord of a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36851475</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Detection of Endoparasites in Non-Native Raccoons from Central Italy.</Title>	<Abstract>The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a carnivore native to North and Central America, gradually introduced into Asia and Europe, including Italy. It is an important carrier of multiple endoparasites, both Protozoa and Helminths, some of them being zoonotic. The aim of this study was to investigate the endoparasites of the non-native raccoon population of Central Italy. Sixty-two raccoons were collected by local competent authorities (sixty trapped and euthanized, two found dead) and subjected to necroscopic examination. Carcasses underwent a broad parasitological investigation, including coprological techniques (macroscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, trachea, and heart, Flotac[&#174;], Baermann test, and immunofluorescence for Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp.), research on respiratory/urinary capillariosis and artificial digestion for Trichinella spp. larvae, and a histopathological examination of the ileum. Ascarid parasites were further identified at the species level using a next-generation sequencing-based amplicon sequencing approach. The results showed the presence of different Protozoa and Nematodes: Baylisascaris procyonis (26/62; 41.9%), Pearsonema sp. (6/62; 9.6%), Capillariidae (6/62; 9.6%), Eimeria sp. (2/62; 3.2%), Cryptosporidium sp. (2/62; 3.2%), and Ancylostomatidae (2/62; 3.2%). B. procyonis is an emerging helminthic zoonotic agent considered a serious concern for public and animal health, given the possibility of its transmission to paratenic hosts, including humans and pets. The demonstrated role of the raccoon as a multi-parasite carrier should be an incentive to continuing the eradication/control of this alien species, and supports the need to implement related disease surveillance programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Extensive knowledge of the anatomy of this nonhuman primate species is not only required for the correct interpretation of obtained research data but also valuable for the welfare of captive individuals housed in, e.g., zoos. As anatomical publications on the rhesus monkey are hardly available, outdated and provide only line drawings or black-and-white photographs, the anatomy of the rhesus monkey was readdressed in this study. The various anatomical structures are described in relation to each other topographically per hindlimb region. The hip region, the upper limb, the knee, the lower limb and the foot are described from various perspectives. The structures that are visible in the different layers, from the superficial to the deepest layer, were photographed. Although the anatomy of the hindlimbs of rhesus monkeys and humans are remarkably similar, various subtle dissimilarities have been observed. Consequently, an open-access publication that focuses on the anatomy of the rhesus monkey would be highly valued by both biomedical researchers and veterinarians.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After collection (n = 40 ejaculates), the gel-free semen volume, concentration, total number of sperm, and sperm morphology were determined. An aliquot of each ejaculate was extended and cooled for 48 h; a second aliquot was cushion-centrifuged and cooled for 48 h; and a third aliquot was processed and then frozen. The total motility (TM) and progressive motility (PM), plasma membrane integrity (PMI), and high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP) were assessed pre-(0 h), 24 h, and 48 h post-cooling and before and after freezing. The second ejaculate had a lower gel-free semen volume (p = 0.026). The sperm concentration was greater in the first than in the second ejaculate (p &lt; 0.001). The sperm morphology was similar between the ejaculates (p &gt; 0.05). Cushion-centrifugation prevented a reduction in the TM, PM, and PMI over time (p &lt; 0.05). The TM, PM, and PMI decreased after freezing but not between the ejaculates (p &gt; 0.05). The first and second ejaculates of the season, which were collected 1 h apart, varied in quantity but not in quality after cooling and freezing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At the age of 10 weeks, the dog was diagnosed with a congenital small left-to-right shunting ventricular septal defect and a mild right ventricular outflow tract obstruction via echocardiography. At that time, the dog was asymptomatic, but the breeder's veterinarian heard a murmur. Both cardiac defects were judged to be clinically non-relevant at that time. However, at 3 years of age, echocardiography revealed a severe right ventricular obstruction, known as a double-chambered right ventricle, along with right-to-left shunting via the ventricular septal defect. Because of chronic hypoxemia due to the right-to-left shunting, erythrocytosis developed. Flow reversal via the shunt was caused by a progressively worsening right ventricular obstruction leading to a supra-systemic right ventricular systolic pressure. Because of the poor prognosis, the dog was euthanized, and the heart was submitted for post-mortem examination. Gross pathologic findings revealed the close proximity of the right ventricular obstructive lesion to the ventricular septal defect. Histopathology revealed localized muscular hypertrophy and severe endocardial fibrosis. The suspected pathogenesis of the progressive obstruction was infiltrative myocardial fibrosis due to turbulent blood flow from the left-to-right shunting ventricular septal defect, as described in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Astroviruses have also been identified in mammals, birds, lower vertebrates and invertebrates. The genetic diversity of human and animal astroviruses poses a challenge for diagnostics and taxonomy. As a proof of concept, we used a panastrovirus consensus primer set, able to amplify in a nested RT-PCR protocol a 400-nt-long fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of most members of the Astroviridae family, in conjunction with a nanopore sequencing platform, to generate information on the astrovirome in filter-feeding mollusks. Amplicons generated from bivalve samples were used to generate libraries for deep sequencing. In three samples, only one unique RdRp sequence type was obtained. However, in seven samples and in three barcodes with eleven pooled samples, we identified a variety of known and unknown RdRp sequence types, in most cases distantly related to astrovirus sequences available in the databases. In total, 37 different sequence contigs were generated. Avian-origin astrovirus sequences were predominant, likely due to contamination of shellfish harvesting waters by marine birds. Astroviruses of the aquatic eco-system were also identified, whereas human astroviruses were not detected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, studies evaluating the feasibility and validity of neurological examination in rabbits are limited. In this study, postural reaction tests or methods commonly performed in dogs and cats were evaluated in clinically healthy rabbits, and we aimed to postulate a simplified examination list according to the results. The feasibility and validity of each test were determined and screened using a cut-off value of 90%. For the remaining tests/methods, the response rates of tests with similar neuroanatomical pathways were compared. Among the 34 healthy rabbits tested, one method of the hopping reaction (holding then lowering the rabbit quickly towards the floor with only the tested limb touching the ground), the hemi-walking test, the wheelbarrowing test, and the righting response yielded a feasibility and validity of over 90%. When comparing tests/methods with similar neuroanatomical pathways, the normal response rate of the hopping reaction was comparable to that of the hemi-walking test. We conclude that in healthy rabbits, hopping reaction tests using the method mentioned above, hemi-walking, wheelbarrowing, and righting responses are likely to be feasible postural reaction tests that yield consistent and normal responses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, it is time-consuming with large numbers of slices. Reducing the slice number would expedite the process, but the effect of fewer slices on the accuracy of volumetric measurements in dogs has not been investigated. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationship between slice interval and the number of slices on hepatic volume in dogs using CT hepatic volumetry and the interobserver variability of CT volumetric measurements. We retrospectively reviewed medical records for dogs without evidence of hepatobiliary disease with abdominal CT from 2019 to 2020. Hepatic volumes were calculated by using all slices, and interobserver variability was calculated using the same dataset in 16 dogs by three observers. Interobserver variability was low, with a mean (&#177;SD) percent difference in the hepatic volume of 3.3 (&#177;2.5)% among all observers. The greatest percent differences in hepatic volume were decreased when using larger numbers of slices; the percent differences were &lt;5% when using &#8805;20 slices for hepatic volumetry. Manual CT hepatic volumetry can be used in dogs to non-invasively assess liver volume with low interobserver variability, and a relatively reliable result can be acquired using &#8805;20 slices in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to describe the clinical features, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and genotypic features of infections associated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales in dogs and cats seen at a tertiary referral veterinary teaching hospital. Enterobacterales isolated from dogs and cats that underwent ESBL testing during the study period were identified using a search of the hospital antimicrobial susceptibility test software database. Medical records of confirmed ESBL isolates were reviewed, and the source of infection, clinical findings, and antimicrobial susceptibility were recorded. Genomic DNA from bacterial isolates was evaluated for antimicrobial resistance genes with whole genome sequencing. Thirty ESBL-producing isolates were identified based on phenotypic testing (twenty-nine from dogs, one from a cat); twenty-six were Escherichia coli and the remainder were Klebsiella spp. Bacterial cystitis was the most commonly identified (8/30, 27%) clinical problem associated with infection. Resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes was identified in 90% (27/30) of isolates, and all isolates were susceptible to imipenem. Over 70% of isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, and cefoxitin. BlaCTX-M-15 was the most common ESBL gene identified, present in 13/22 (59%) isolate genomes. A wide range of clinical infections were identified. Piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin may be alternatives to carbapenem therapy.

The goal of this study was to examine how adding pomegranate peel (PP), garlic powder (GP), or a mixture of the two to the diet of does affect their weight, the number of offspring, reproductive performance, hematological indices, and several antioxidants indicators as well as the liver and kidney functions. A total of 20 adult and mature female mixed rabbits at age 4.5-5 months and averaging 3.05 &#177; 0.63 kg body weight, were allocated into four experimental groups (n = 5). The first group was provided with the basal diet and was considered as control animals, while the second, third, and fourth groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with PP 3.0%, GP 3.0%, and a mixture of PP 1.5% + GP 1.5%, respectively. After 2 weeks of feeding the experimental diets, natural mating with untreated bucks was carried out. The kits were weighed immediately after parturition, and then every week. The study found that rabbits fed with 3% PP led to a 28.5% increase in the number of kits at birth compared to the control group. As an effect of supplementing PP 3%, GP 3%, and PP 1.5% + GP 1.5%, the birth weight increased by 9.2%, 7.2%, and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the control. Hemoglobin increased significantly in all treatment groups as compared to the control at the age of kit weaning. Lymph cells increased significantly in the rabbits that were fed with GP (3%) than in other groups and even the control. The results showed that creatinine levels were significantly decreased in the PP (3%) and GP (3%) than in control rabbits. The level of triglycerides significantly declines in groups treated with PP (3%) than in other treatment groups and the control. The addition of PP 3% or GP 3% increased the progesterone hormone. The addition of PP 1.5% + GP 1.5% improved the immunoglobulin IgG. The results of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity showed a significant decline in groups treated with GP (3%) than other treated groups. In conclusion, pomegranate is a promising substance to include in a rabbit's diet, followed by garlic to boost reproductive efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977219</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>American Foulbrood-Old and Always New Challenge.</Title>	<Abstract>American foulbrood (AFB) is exclusively an infectious disease of honey bee larvae (Apis mellifera) and their subspecies that is spread easily and rapidly and is often present in apiaries. Due to the resistance and pathogenicity of the bacterial causative agent of the disease, which has considerable epizootiological and economic significance for beekeeping, AFB was classified as a highly dangerous, infectious animal disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Considering the severity of the infection, a frequent occurrence, rapid and easy spread, epizooty and enzooty are common. We tried to present an overview of the latest information related to AFB through several chapters. In addition to the latest data on the etiology of the causative agent, the most important elements of the clinical signs of the disease are also listed. Along with an overview of classic microbiological and the latest molecular methods of diagnosis, we also discuss AFB treatment from its differential diagnostic aspect. We hope that through demonstrating the mentioned preventive measures and measures of good beekeeping practice, the review will contribute to the preservation of the health of bees and therefore the overall biodiversity of the planet.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There are two serotypes recognized: New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV). The virus can be transmitted directly by contact or by vectors. In 2018, Ecuador experienced an outbreak of Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) in cattle, caused by VSNJV and VSVIV, with 399 cases reported distributed over 18 provinces. We determined the phylogenetic relationships among 67 strains. For the construction of phylogenetic trees, the viral phosphoprotein gene was sequenced, and trees were constructed based on the Maximum Likelihood method using 2004 outbreak strains from Ecuador (GenBank) and the 2018 sequences (this article). We built a haplotype network for VSNJV to trace the origin of the 2004 and 2018 epizootics through topology and mutation connections. These analyses suggest two different origins, one related to the 2004 outbreak and the other from a transmission source in 2018. Our analysis also suggests different transmission patterns; several small and independent outbreaks, most probably transmitted by vectors in the Amazon, and another outbreak caused by the movement of livestock in the Andean and Coastal regions. We recommend further research into vectors and vertebrate reservoirs in Ecuador to clarify the mechanisms of the reemergence of the virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to their biomechanical function, the menisci in the canine stifle play an important role in osteoarthritis. They compensate for the incongruence in the joint and distribute and minimize compressive loads, protecting the hyaline articular cartilage from damage. Meniscal degeneration favors the development and progression of stifle joint osteoarthritis. Qualitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current golden standard for detecting meniscal changes, but it has limitations in detecting early signs of meniscal degeneration. A quantitative MRI offers new options for detecting early structural changes. T2 mapping can especially visualize structural changes such as altered collagen structures and water content, as well as deviations in proteoglycan content. This study evaluated T2 mapping and performed a histological scoring of menisci in elderly dogs that had no or only low radiographic osteoarthritis grades. A total of 16 stifles from 8 older dogs of different sex and breed underwent ex vivo magnet resonance imaging, including a T2 mapping pulse sequence with multiple echoes. A histological analysis of corresponding menisci was performed using a modified scoring system. The mean T2 relaxation time was 18.2 ms and the mean histological score was 4.25. Descriptive statistics did not reveal a correlation between T2 relaxation time and histological score. Ex vivo T2 mapping of canine menisci did not demonstrate histological changes, suggesting that early meniscal degeneration can be present in the absence of radiological signs of osteoarthritis, including no significant changes in T2 relaxation time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

No single diagnostic test is identified as the "gold standard". The purpose of the study was to evaluate the sensitivity of adhesive tape impression (ATI) cytology in dermatophyte identification and to compare three diagnostic tests for dermatophytosis. Thirty dogs, with alopecia (n = 19) or kerion (n = 11), and fifteen cats with alopecia were included in the study. Dermatophytosis was diagnosed with tape preparations in 82.2% (37/45) of cases, while with hair plucks in 66.7% (30/45) and fungal culture in 80% (36/45). In kerions, tape preparations and fungal culture had the same sensitivity (10/11, 90.9%) that was higher than that of hair plucks (4/11, 36.4%). The sensitivity was higher in cats than in dogs with alopecia for all tests, 80% versus (vs.) 73.7%, 86.7% vs. 68.4%, and 93.3% vs. 68.4% for cats and dogs for hair plucks, fungal culture, and tape preparations, respectively. No significant difference was found between the three tests, except for dogs with kerion. Hair plucks were less sensitive than fungal culture in kerions (p = 0.041), while in comparison with tape preparations they were marginally not significantly different (p = 0.078). ATI cytology is a useful diagnostic test in dermatophytosis, in dogs with kerion as well as cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The kidney, one of major organs in the body, is susceptible to ischemia and reperfusion; however, there are few studies on renal ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has been discovered to have some beneficial effects beyond its original effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate possible therapeutic effects of risperidone on renal IRI following cardiac arrest. Rats were subjected to cardiac arrest induced by asphyxia for five minutes followed by ROSC. When serum biochemical analyses were examined, the levels of serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase were dramatically increased after cardiac arrest, but they were significantly reduced by risperidone administration. Histopathology was examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histopathological injury induced by cardiac arrest was apparently attenuated by risperidone administration. Furthermore, alterations in pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-4 and interleukin-13) were examined by immunohistochemistry. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities were gradually and markedly increased and decreased, respectively, in the kidneys following cardiac arrest; however, risperidone administration after cardiac arrest significantly attenuated the increased pro-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities and the decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities. Collectively, our current results revealed that, in rats, risperidone administration after cardiac arrest protected kidneys from IRI induced by cardiac arrest and ROSC through anti-inflammatory effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred and twenty adult female Baladi goats (sixty pneumonic and sixty apparently healthy) were used in this study. DNA and RNA were extracted from blood samples collected from the jugular vein of each goat. SLC11A1, CD-14, CCL2, TLR1, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, &#946; defensin, SP110, SPP1, BP1, A2M, ADORA3, CARD15, IRF3, and SCART1 SNPs that have been previously found to be associated with pneumonia resistance/susceptibility were identified via PCR-DNA sequencing. The pneumonic and healthy goats differed significantly, according to a Chi-square analysis of the discovered SNPs. The mRNA levels of the studied immune markers were noticeably greater in the pneumonic goats than in the healthy ones. The findings could support the significance of the use of immune gene expression profiles and nucleotide variations as biomarkers for the susceptibility/resistance to pneumonia and provide a practical management technique for Baladi goats. These results also suggest a potential strategy for lowering pneumonia in goats by employing genetic markers linked to an animal's ability to fend off infection in selective breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977225</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Epidemiologic Factors Supporting Triage of Infected Dog Patients Admitted to a Veterinary Hospital Biological Isolation and Containment Unit.</Title>	<Abstract>The teaching hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Lisbon hosts a Biological Isolation and Containment Unit (BICU) for the hospitalization of both confirmed and suspected animals of an infectious disease. This study targets the BICU dog population to identify and characterize the most frequent infectious diseases recorded in a 7-year period. Several epidemiologic factors were analyzed for their significance to triage infected cases. During the study period, 534 dogs were admitted, of which 263 (49.3%) had a confirmed infectious disease diagnosis: parvovirosis (49.4%; n = 130); leptospirosis (21.7%; n = 57); multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection; (10.6%; n = 28), and canine distemper (9.9%; n = 26). Several potential risk factors for these diseases were identified: age under 2 years old (p &lt; 0.001), incomplete vaccination for parvovirosis (p &lt; 0.001), age &#8805; 10 years old (p &lt; 0.001), and the presence of concomitant disorders for MDR-infected cases (p = 0.03). Logistic regression models were constructed to classify cases and controls. The sensitivity and specificity estimates were very high (&gt;0.83) for parvovirosis, MDR, and distemper infections. A lower sensitivity (0.77) was obtained for identifying cases with leptospirosis. In conclusion, infectious diseases are frequent, hence, it is essential to decrease their occurrence through effective preventive measures such as vaccination. The constructed logistic models can also help in triaging admitted dogs with a potential infectious disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977226</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>First Report on Medical Treatment and Outcome of Burnt Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>The management of livestock affected by fire often comes down to two options: euthanasia or slaughtering. However, the therapeutic approach can be attempted for high-value cattle. The aim of a primary assessment is to identify signs of smoke inhalation injuries, cardiovascular impairment and shock and to determine the severity and extent of burn injuries. Full-thickness burns covering 40% or more of the body are highly unfavorable prognostic factors and are usually fatal. Moreover, it can take several days for the burns to appear in their full extent, leaving the prognosis uncertain. In this case report, the clinical findings, treatment and outcome of two burnt Holstein heifers are described. Daily wound care required cleaning, the removal of eschars and the application of topical antibacterial agents for seven months in order to discharge one heifer. The topical use of honey with a solution of povidone-iodine proved to be affordable and successful, with no residue risks. The other heifer was more severely wounded, and despite the administration of fluid therapy, pain management, anti-oxidants and anti-microbials, after initial stabilization, the animal's condition worsened, leading to euthanasia. This confirms that the treatment of burnt cattle is possible but challenging due to the late onset of multi-organ failure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study area is located in the hunting grounds (HG), which are managed by the "&#536;tefan cel Mare" University in Suceava. Between October 2017 and April 2022, the behaviour and the types of food consumed by stray dogs captured in the outskirts of the localities in the study area were analysed. A sample of 183 stray dogs were used for the study, and the analysis established the distribution and density of the dogs in the free-range area compared to the density of the wild animals of hunting interest. The tracks and travel routes of the stray dogs were highlighted. Areas where packs of feral dogs camp were also identified. Observations were made of the individual and social behaviours of the dogs, their gregariousness and the way in which they hunt. The types of food consumed were analysed for each specimen. Through the collected and analysed data, the opportunistic predatory behaviour of the stray dogs was highlighted. Thus, stray dogs revert to the typical wild canid ways of behaving. As for food, our results showed the dogs' predilection for meat, both wild and domestic. On the other hand, the diet of roaming dogs is much more varied compared to that of wild canids. This is due to the fact that the way in which domestic dogs feed has changed over thousands of years as a result of living alongside humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to the emergence of PRV variant strains in recent years, vaccines cannot provide complete protection against the infection of PRV. Therefore, the research on antiviral compounds is of great importance for PRV treatment. In this study, an EGFP-labeled PRV was used to screen anti-PRV compounds from 86 natural product extracts. Gallocatechin gallate was found to efficiently inhibit the replication of PRV with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.41 &#956;M. In addition, it was found that gallocatechin gallate was unable to directly inactivate PRV and had no effect on the attachment stage of PRV. However, it was found that gallocatechin gallate significantly suppressed the viral entry stage. Furthermore, it was found that the release stage of PRV was also significantly suppressed by gallocatechin gallate. Together, this study found that gallocatechin gallate could efficiently inhibit the replication of PRV by suppressing the entry and release stages of PRV, which will contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy against PRV infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objectives of this case series were to determine if a previously published tumor histological grading scheme, the level of tumor cellular atypia, clinical staging, or the level of CD 31 expression were useful for predicting the survival time in dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma. Canine splenic hemangiosarcomas from 16 dogs were histologically graded, clinically staged, and assessed for CD 31 expression. Medical records were reviewed, the date of death was obtained, and survival data were analyzed statistically. Histopathological grading and clinical staging of canine splenic hemangiosarcomas, and the expression of CD 31 by the tumor cells were not significantly associated with the median survival time of the dogs in this study. However, strong expression of CD 31 by canine splenic hemangiosarcoma tumor cells was observed in dogs with short survival times, which warrants further studies to evaluate the potential prognostic value of CD 31 expression for the survival of dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Herein, we genetically engineered PRRSV with serine (S) substitution on the 44th asparagine (N) on the GP5 ectodomain of PRRSV-2 lineage-1. To evaluate the recombinant PRRSV, in vivo experiments were performed in piglets. The recombinant virus group showed no viremia until 42 days post-inoculation (dpi), and the rectal temperature and average daily weight gain were in the normal range at the same time point as the negative control group. On the 42 dpi, both groups were challenged with the wild-type virus. The recombinant PRRSV group showed lower rectal temperature, viremia, and the lung lesions than that of the negative control group for 19 days post-challenge (dpc). Additionally, the recombinant virus induced 4.50 &#177; 3.00 (log2) and 8.25 &#177; 0.96 (log2) of neutralizing antibody before and after challenge, respectively. Taken together, this study confirmed that N44S substitution can create an infectious PRRSV that strongly induces neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the vCSL1-GP5-N44S mutant that we produced was confirmed to have potential as a vaccine candidate, showing good safety and protective effects in pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human patients, the CT characteristics of the thymus in children and adults is well described. Furthermore, it is known in human medicine that stress can lead to a reduction in the size of the thymus, followed by a phase of hyperplasia (called the 'rebound effect'). The visualization of thymic tissue in the cranial mediastinum of adult dogs with neoplasia is possible and could be related to a similar effect. In this study, we aimed to describe the CT characteristics of the thymus in adult dogs with neoplasia and to compare the aspect of the thymus in these dogs to juvenile dogs with a presumed normal thymus. A total of 11 adult dogs with neoplasia and 20 juvenile dogs were included. Several CT features of the thymus were evaluated, including the size, shape, and pre- and post-contrast attenuation values. The overall appearance was lobulated in all of the adult dogs and homogeneous in all of the juvenile dogs; it was left-sided in all of the adult dogs, while it was located in the midline in a few of the juvenile dogs (right-sided only in one). The thymus was less attenuating in adult dogs, in some cases with negative minimum pre-contrast attenuation values. In some dogs with neoplasia, the thymus can be detected at CT examination despite their age.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CEPs include innocuous procedures that are well tolerated by animals as well as more distressful and less tolerated ones. In a classical approach, institutional animals are used to teach and practice CEPs. Two hundred and thirty-one undergraduate students from four consecutive years were assigned to two groups that used institutional animals only (AO) or a combination of students' owned animals and simulation models (model-animal, MA) to teach and practice CEPs. This latter comprised stuffed teddy dogs, eye and ear models made of molding silicone, as well as skin models. The learning outcome of each system was compared through questionnaires (throughout classes and at the end of course), grades, and pass rates in objectively structured clinical examinations. Most veterinary students had their own animals, being easy to have a dog per group of two students in class. All the students' owned animals adapted well to this environment. The interest in the practical activities with the simulation models was comparable to that exhibited in the classical AO system. Students reported to learn more with the MA system than with the AO, while the interest on the subjects and the relevance were appraised similarly in both systems. No differences existed in the final grades and pass rates. The MA system was effective for learning CEPs. Beyond animal welfare advantages, this system increased the out-of-school training and had financial saving benefits, being a valuable option for the teaching and training of CEPs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The adults and larvae found were subjected to morphological analysis and molecular identification by PCR-RFLP. A total of 181 Contracaecum specimens were detected in all of the four great cormorants examined (prevalence = 100%), showing an intensity of infestation between nine and ninety-two. A co-infestation by adult and larval forms of Contracaecum rudolphii was found only in one of the great cormorants examined. Following molecular investigations, 48 specimens of C. rudolphii A and 38 specimens of C. rudolphii B were detected, revealing co-infestation solely for the great cormorant from Leporano Bay (Southern Italy). Our results showed an opposite ratio between C. rudolphii A and C. rudolphii B in Pantelleria and in Salso Lake (Southern Italy) compared to what was reported in the literature, probably due to migratory stopovers and the ecology of the infested fish species, confirming the role of Contracaecum nematodes as ecological tags of their hosts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We undertook a longitudinal survey over a period of 8 months during which we asked about people's work patterns, dog management, and their dogs' behaviour. Generalized linear models revealed that the pre-existence of signs of potential separation-related problems, and especially vocalisation, self-injury, and chewing to escape confinement, was associated with an increase in a range of separation issues. Dogs showing separation-related signs prior to COVID were also more likely to develop more problems during lockdown. Management changes tended to result in increased physical and social stress, with a range of potential compensatory actions taken by the dog, however these signs of stress did not generally appear to be connected to separation-related issues. Survival analysis was used to investigate the emergence of specific issues over time. This indicated that a change to working from home was related initially to a decreased risk of aggression towards the owner, but over time, those who continued to work from the home were at an increased risk of this problem. No other significant time-related relationships were found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present investigation aimed to evaluate the ability of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) to induce trabecular bone healing either alone or combined with a xenograft in a rat femoral critical-size defect model. Five-mm bone defects were created in the femoral diaphysis of fifty-six skeletally mature male Wistar albino rats. The animals were divided into six groups: one control group and five experimental groups. The defects in the control group were left empty, whereas an absorbable collagen cone soaked either with saline or erythropoietin (alone or in combination with xenograft) was placed in locally treated groups. The systemic treatment group received EPO subcutaneously. Bone formation was objectively evaluated through radiography, osteodensitometry and histological examination on post-operative days 30 and 90. The results demonstrate that EPO, locally applied on a collagen scaffold, was capable of inducing bone healing, whereas the single systemically administered high EPO dose had only an insignificant effect on bone formation. The combination of EPO with a bone substitute under the form of cancellous granules resulted in more rapid integration between the xenograft and host bone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the veterinary field, FC enabled the study of the immune response in cattle infected with different pathogens, as well as vaccine testing. However, few fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies recognize bovine antigens, limiting the possible benefits of FC and the implementation of multiparametric analysis for more complex studies. Two cytometry panels with five colors each were designed and implemented for the study and identification of populations and subpopulations of T cells derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of dairy heifers. Both panels detected differences in T cell subpopulations between heifers positively and negatively tested for tuberculin; they detected overexpression of CD25[+] and CD45RO[+] in tuberculin-positive heifers after stimulation with a culture filtrate protein extract (CFPE) from Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). We identified subpopulations of T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using two multicolor panels. These panels could be used to analyze total bovine blood in immunopathogenic studies and vaccine development.

This decree had a substantial impact on the mental health of both people and dogs. We carried out a national survey to compare the personalities of adult dogs who were puppies in lockdown (from March to May 2020) with those of adult dogs born after that time (from June 2020 to February 2021). Our results highlighted a significant increase in personality traits related to fear and aggression in dogs who experienced lockdown restrictions during their socialization period, further confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic strongly impacted the behavioral development of dogs. Therefore, it may be advantageous for these dogs to be closely monitored by veterinary behaviorists and receive specialized behavioral rehabilitation therapy to lower the risk of episodes of aggression and fearfulness as well as to increase the wellbeing of dogs raised under social restrictions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In total, 137, 98 and 114 replacement gilts were selected at the age of weaning from 3 herds-A, B and C-with different genetic lines. Dorsal claw length was measured, and anisodactylia was measured in all four feet, at weaning age, and at those gilts that completed their first and second farrowing. At the first and second farrowing stage, the infrared temperature distribution, dew/claw length and backfat thickness were measured concurrently with claw lesion and mobility score evaluation. The maximum temperature significantly differed (p &lt; 0.01) among herds, in the rear feet and in all four feet at the first and second farrowing respectively. Claw lengths statistically differed among herds at all stages (p &lt; 0.05). Anisodactylia in rear feet was lower in herd A (p &lt; 0.05) at weaning, and in herd C at the first and second farrowing (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the claw lesion score, mobility, backfat thickness and reproductive performance statistically differed among herds (p &lt; 0.05).

Online validity-tested questionnaires were used to collect data, with 106 (73 veterinarians and 33 students) and 157 (126 veterinarians and 31 students) surveys collected in 2014 and 2022, respectively. Respondents would be asked to rate their perceptions on how likely each risk factor constitutes a medical dispute according to their past experiences on a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5: "Very unlikely, unlikely, neutral, likely, very likely." The results showed that overall risk perceptions increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2014, with the top risk factors being attitudes during interactions and complaint management among experienced veterinarians. In contrast, students considered medical skills and clients' perspectives as the top two risk factors, with complaints management ranking as the least significant factor. The findings suggest that effective communication and complaint management are crucial in preventing medical disputes, highlighting the importance of developing these skills in young veterinarians and veterinary students to reduce medical disputes. The study also recommends increasing practical experiences of medical disputes and complaint management in veterinary education to bridge the gap between the perceptions of experienced veterinarians and students.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To identify and evaluate the effects of 2,5-HD on sows' reproductive performance, we used porcine ovarian granulosa cells (pGCs) as a vehicle and carried out cell morphology and transcriptome analyses. 2,5-HD has the potential to inhibit the proliferation of pGCs and induce morphological changes and apoptosis depending on the dose. RNA-seq analyses identified 4817 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 2394 down-regulated and 2423 up-regulated following 2,5-HD exposure treatment. The DEG, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, was significantly enriched in the p53 signaling pathway. Thus, we evaluated its function in pGC apoptosis in vitro. Then, we knocked down the CDKN1A gene in the pGCs to identify its effects on pGCs. Its knockdown decreased pGC apoptosis, with significantly fewer cells in the G1 phase (p &lt; 0.05) and very significantly more cells in the S phase (p &lt; 0.01). Herein, we revealed novel candidate genes that influence pGCs apoptosis and cell cycle and provided new insights into the role of CDKN1A in pGCs during apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977241</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Seasonal Occurrence of Cattle Fascioliasis in Kelantan, Malaysia.</Title>	<Abstract>A longitudinal study was conducted in five randomly selected farms in Kelantan, Malaysia to determine the seasonal occurrence of cattle fascioliasis and its association with climatic factors. A total of 480 faecal samples were collected by a random purposive sampling method from July 2018 to June 2019. The faecal samples were examined for the presence of Fasciola eggs using a formalin ether sedimentation technique. Meteorological data including temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pan evaporation were obtained from a local meteorological station. The overall prevalence of cattle fascioliasis in Kelantan was 45.8%. The prevalence was observed to be slightly higher during the wet season from August to December (50-58%) than during the dry season from January to June (30-45%). Meanwhile, the mean eggs per gram (EPG) were highest in June (191.1 &#177; 0.48) and lowest in October (77.62 &#177; 95.5). However, there were no significant differences in the mean of EPG between the monthly prevalence, tested using one-way ANOVA (p = 0.1828). A statistically significant association (p = 0.014) was observed between the disease and cattle breeds, with Charolais and Brahman showing lower odds of having the disease. There were significant moderate-to-strong positive correlations between cattle fascioliasis and rainfall (r = 0.666; p = 0.018) and humidity (r = 0.808; p = 0.001), as well as strong negative correlations with evaporation (r = -0.829; p = 0.001). The results indicated that the higher prevalence of cattle fascioliasis in Kelantan was correlated with the climatic factors, which include higher rainfall and humidity and lower evaporation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of FGMS on the quality of life of diabetic pet owners (DPOs). Fifty DPOs were asked to answer a 30-question survey. More than 80% of DPOs considered FGMS easier to use and less stressful and painful for the animal compared to blood glucose curves (BGCs). Overall, 92% of DPOs reported that their pet had better diabetes control since using FGMS. The most challenging aspects of using the FGMS were ensuring proper sensor fixation during the wearing period (47%), preventing premature detachment (40%), and purchasing the sensor (34%). Moreover, 36% of DPOs reported that the device cost was difficult to afford in the long term. Comparing dogs and cats, a significantly higher number of dogs' owners found the FGMS to be well-tolerated (79% vs. 40%), less invasive than BGCs (79% vs. 43%), and easier to maintain in situ (76% vs. 43%). In conclusion, FGMS is considered by DPOs to be easy to use and less stressful compared to BGCs, while enabling better glycemic control. Nevertheless, the costs related to its long-term use might be difficult to sustain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Improved understanding of the timing of BRD events, including subsequent deleterious outcomes, promotes efficient resource allocation. This study's objective was to determine differences in timing distributions of initial BRD treatments (Tx1), days to death after initial treatment (DTD), and days after arrival to fatal disease onset (FDO). Individual animal records for the first BRD treatment (n = 301,721) or BRD mortality (n = 19,332) were received from 25 feed yards. A subset of data (318-363 kg; steers/heifers) was created and Wasserstein distances were used to compare temporal distributions of Tx1, FDO, and DTD across genders (steers/heifers) and the quarter of arrival. Disease frequency varied by quarter with the greatest Wasserstein distances observed between Q2 and Q3 and between Q2 and Q4. Cattle arriving in Q3 and Q4 had earlier Tx1 events than in Q2. Evaluating FDO and DTD revealed the greatest Wasserstein distance between cattle arriving in Q2 and Q4, with cattle arriving in Q2 having later events. Distributions of FDO varied by gender and quarter and typically had wide distributions with the largest 25-75% quartiles ranging from 20 to 80 days (heifers arriving in Q2). The DTD had right-skewed distributions with 25% of cases occurring by days 3-4 post-treatment. Results illustrate temporal disease and outcome patterns are largely right-skewed and may not be well represented by simple arithmetic means. Knowledge of typical temporal patterns allows cattle health managers to focus disease control efforts on the correct groups of cattle at the appropriate time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>36977245</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Wolf Is Back: A Novel Sensitive Sentinel Rejoins the Trichinella Cycle in the Western Alps.</Title>	<Abstract>Trichinella is a foodborne parasite whose wildlife reservoirs are represented by carnivores and omnivores with predatory and scavenger behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of Trichinella infection in grey wolves (Canis lupus) that recolonized the Western Alps from the end of the past century, and discuss the epidemiological role played by this apex predator in the early phases of its return. During the period 2017-2022, diaphragm samples were obtained from 130 individuals collected in the frame of a wolf mortality survey. Trichinella larvae were found in 15 wolves (11.53%) with a parasite intensity of 11.74 larvae per gram. Trichinella britovi was the only species identified. This is the first prevalence survey of Trichinella in wolves recolonizing the Alps. Results suggest that, in this particular biotope, the wolf has rejoined the Trichinella cycle and has the potential to play an increasingly important role as maintenance host. Arguments in favor and against this perspective are discussed and knowledge gaps highlighted. The calculated Trichinella larval biomass in the estimated wolf population roaming in Northwest Italy will serve as baseline value to explore possible shifts in the relative importance of wolves as Trichinella reservoir within the regional carnivore community. Finally, wolves re-colonizing the Alps already appear as sensitive sentinels to monitor the risk of Trichinella zoonotic transmission by infected wild boar meat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

EIU was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). During LPS injection, 5-ALA diluted with saline was administered via gastric gavage. After 24 h, clinical scores were assessed after which aqueous humor (AqH) samples were obtained. The number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in AqH were measured. For histological examination, both eyes of some rats were enucleated. In vitro, a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7 cells) was stimulated by LPS with or without 5-ALA. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2. 5-ALA suppressed the EIU clinical scores, infiltrating cell number, and protein concentration while improving the histopathologic scores. In particular, 100 mg/kg 5-ALA reduced the concentrations of NO, PGE2, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 in AqH, similar to 1 mg/kg prednisolone. In addition, 5-ALA suppressed iNOS upregulation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, 5-ALA has an anti-inflammatory effect on EIU through the inhibition of the upregulation of inflammatory mediators.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to explore the hypothesis of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease through the association between birth weight and adiposity in adult dogs. The association between body condition score (BCS) and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), measured in the flanks, abdomen and lumbar regions, was assessed in a population 88 adult Labradors (&gt;1 year). Significant positive moderate correlations between BCS and SFT were described. A linear mixed-effects model was used to investigate the association between birth weight and SFT by adjusting for sex, age, neuter status and the anatomical site of the measurement. The results showed that SFT values increased with age and were higher in sterilized than in entire dogs. In addition, SFT values were higher in the lumbar region compared to the other anatomical sites. Finally, the model revealed a significant association between SFT and birth weight, suggesting that, as in other species, dogs with the lowest birth weights have thicker subcutaneous fat at adulthood than the others. The assessment of visceral adipose tissue and the relative importance of birth weight among the numerous risk factors of overweight remains to be explored in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 45 cats with SP from June 2014 to June 2019. Case definition was based on an internist's review of clinopathologic data, Spec fPL concentration, and AUS findings. Information extracted from the medical records included signalment, history, physical examination findings, selected clinicopathological data (total bilirubin, glucose, ALP, ALT, and total calcium), Spec fPL concentration, AUS images/clips, length of hospitalization, and survival data. Hazard ratios were used to evaluate the association between clinicopathological data, the Spec fPL assay, AUS findings, and the length of hospitalization. Clinicopathological abnormalities, the Spec fPL, and AUS abnormalities were not statistically associated with the length of hospitalization. Despite a lack of statistical significance, the hazard ratios suggest the potential that an elevated total bilirubin (hazard ratio (HR): 1.19), hypocalcemia (HR: 1.49), and an elevated Spec fPL concentration (HR: 1.54) could be associated with prolonged hospitalization, although additional studies would be needed to verify this. Additionally, hazard ratios suggest that AUS evidence of concurrent gallbladder (HR: 1.61) and gastric abnormalities (HR: 1.36) could be associated with prolonged hospitalization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Marketing decisions made prior to backgrounding may shift BRD incidence into a different phase of production, and the importance of host gene expression on BRD incidence as it relates to marketing strategy is poorly understood. Our objective was to compare the influence of marketing on host transcriptomes measured on arrival at a backgrounding facility on the subsequent probability of being treated for BRD during a 45-day backgrounding phase. This study, through RNA-Seq analysis of blood samples collected on arrival, evaluated gene expression differences between cattle which experienced a commercial auction setting (AUCTION) versus cattle directly shipped to backgrounding from the cow-calf phase (DIRECT); further analyses were conducted to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cattle which remained clinically healthy during backgrounding (HEALTHY) versus those that required treatment for clinical BRD within 45 days of arrival (BRD). A profound difference in DEGs (n = 2961) was identified between AUCTION cattle compared to DIRECT cattle, regardless of BRD development; these DEGs encoded for proteins involved in antiviral defense (increased in AUCTION), cell growth regulation (decreased in AUCTION), and inflammatory mediation (decreased in AUCTION). Nine and four DEGs were identified between BRD and HEALTHY cohorts in the AUCTION and DIRECT groups, respectively; DEGs between disease cohorts in the AUCTION group encoded for proteins involved in collagen synthesis and platelet aggregation (increased in HEALTHY). Our work demonstrates the clear influence marketing has on host expression and identified genes and mechanisms which may predict BRD risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 258 Ross 308 chicks were divided into six dietary regimens, including: a basal diet without additives as a first control group (CON); the second group received a basal diet supplemented with 200 g/t in the starter phase and 100 g/t in the grower and finisher phase; the third group-400 g/t and 200 g/t; the fourth group-600 g/t and 300 g/t; the fifth group-800 g/t and 400 g/t; and the sixth group-1000 g/t and 500 g/t of a complex phytobiotic supplement based on tannins, respectively. The CPFA contains the following: tannins 36.8-55.2%, eugenol 0.4-0.6%, cinnamon aldehyde 0.8-1.2%, zinc-methionine 1.6-2.4%, calcium butyrate 8-12%, silicon dioxide 1.2-1.8% and dextrose up to 100%. The maximum introduction of phytobiotics (1000 g/t) at 7 days of age leads to a decrease in the live weight of broilers which reduced by 8.27% (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the minimum level of phytobiotics (200 g/t). From 15-21 days, the live weight was significant between the supplemented and control groups and represented 396.21, 384.81 and 384.16 vs. 316.91 g for the CPFA 4, CPFA 5, CPFA 1 and control group, respectively. Furthermore, the same trend was recorded in the average daily gain during the periods between 15-21 and 22-28 days of the experiment. Feeding CPFA had a positive effect on the carcass indicators, except for the feeding of CPFA 3 in the amount of 600 g/t in the starter phase and 300 g/t in the grower and finish phases, which recorded the lowest weight in relation to the CPFA 1 and 2 groups and represented 1309.58 vs. 1460.06 and 1456.52 g, respectively, and the difference was significant. The inclusion of CPFA in poultry diets contributed to an increase in lung mass in the experimental groups relative to the control group, except for the CPFA 5 group which represented the lowest weight of lung mass (6.51 g) and the differences were significant between the CPFA 2 and CPFA 3 and the control groups. The highest concentration of leukocytes was observed during the experiment period in the group of poultry receiving phytobiotics (CPFA 3), which significantly exceeded the control group by 2.37 &#215; 109/L. A significant decrease in the level of cholesterol was recorded in the CPFA groups when compared to the control group and represented 2.83 vs. 3.55 mmol/L, respectively. Consequently, the introduction of vegetable feed additives from complex phytobiotic feed additives (CPFA) in the diets of Ross 308 chicks had a positive effect on the growth production, the carcass yield, the mass of the pectoral muscles and the mass of the lungs. Moreover, it did not cause a harmful effect on the biochemical parameters of the blood.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although the disease effects honey bee larvae, it threatens the entire colony. Clinical signs of the disease are seen at a very late stage of the disease and bee colonies are often beyond saving. Therefore, through active monitoring based on screening, an infection can be detected early and bee colonies can be protected with hygiene measures. As a result, the pressure to spread in an area remains low. The cultural and molecular biological detection of P. larvae is usually preceded by spore germination before detection. In this study, we compared the results of two methods, the culture detection and RT-PCR detection of DNA directly isolated from spores. Samples of honey and cells with honey surrounding the brood were used in a five-year voluntary monitoring program in a western part of Lower Austria. DNA-extraction from spores to speed up detection involved one chemical and two enzymatic steps before mechanical bashing-beat separation and additional lysis. The results are comparable to culture-based methods, but with a large time advantage. Within the voluntary monitoring program, the proportion of bee colonies without the detection of P. larvae was high (2018: 91.9%, 2019: 72.09%, 2020: 74.6%, 2021: 81.35%, 2022: 84.5%), and in most P. larvae-positive bee colonies, only a very low spore content was detected. Nevertheless, two bee colonies in one apiary with clinical signs of disease had to be eradicated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to explore the effect of antioxidants and oxidants in boar spermatozoa and their surrounding fluid (SF) on the activation of AMPK during the liquid storage. Ejaculates from Duroc boars, routinely used for semen production, were collected and diluted to a final concentration of 25 &#215; 10[6]/mL. In experiment 1, twenty-five semen samples from eighteen boars were stored at 17 &#176;C for 7 days. In experiment 2, three pooled semen samples created from nine ejaculates of nine boars were used, and each sample was treated with 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 &#956;M/L H2O2 and stored at 17 &#176;C for 3 h. Sperm quality and functionality, antioxidants and oxidants in boar spermatozoa and SF, the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, and the expression levels of the phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172) were determined. Sperm quality significantly decreased with storage time in terms of viability (p &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant and oxidant levels were markedly affected with storage time, with a decline in the SF total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p &lt; 0.05), SF malondialdehyde (MDA) (p &lt; 0.05), and the sperm's total oxidant status (TOS), as well as a fluctuation in sperm superoxidase dismutase-like (SOD-like) activity (p &lt; 0.05). The intracellular AMP/ATP ratio increased (p &lt; 0.05) on day 4 and subsequently decreased to its lowest value on days 6 and 7 (p &lt; 0.05). The phosphorylated AMPK levels increased from day 2 to day 7 (p &lt; 0.05). Correlation analyses indicate that sperm quality during liquid storage was correlated to antioxidants and oxidants in spermatozoa and SF (p &lt; 0.05), which were correlated to the phosphorylation of sperm AMPK (p &lt; 0.05). Treatment with H2O2 induced damages in sperm quality (p &lt; 0.05), a decline in antioxidant levels (SF TAC, p &lt; 0.05; sperm SOD-like activity, p &lt; 0.01), an increase in oxidant levels (SF MDA, p &lt; 0.05; intracellular ROS production, p &lt; 0.05), a higher AMP/ATP ratio (p &lt; 0.05), and phosphorylated AMPK levels (p &lt; 0.05) in comparison with the control. The results suggest that antioxidants and oxidants in boar spermatozoa and SF are involved in AMPK activation during liquid storage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Though the presence of a commensal uterine microbiota is now well established, the complex role of these bacteria in genital health, fertility, and susceptibility to uterine diseases remains unclear. In this study, we explore the endometrial microbiota through 16S rRNA gene profiling from cytobrush samples taken ex vivo from healthy, pregnant, and endometritis cows. There were no significant differences between healthy and pregnant cows, whose uterine microbiota were dominated by Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Fusobacterium, Lactococcus and Bacteroides. Compared to pregnant and clinically healthy cows, the uterine bacterial community of endometritis cows was significantly decreased in species diversity (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting uneven community composition in different patterns with either dominance of Escherichia-Shigella, Histophilus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas or Actinobacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While the microbiota of the EEC in healthy dogs and in the presence of otitis externa has been described, only sparse information is available concerning the normal microbiota of the middle ear. The objective was to compare the tympanic bulla (TB) with the external ear canal (EEC) microbiota in healthy dogs. Six healthy experimental Beagle dogs were selected based on the absence of otitis externa, negative cytology and bacterial culture from the TB. Samples from the EEC and TB were collected directly after death using a total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy. The hypervariable segment V1-V3 of the 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced with a MiSeq Illumina. The sequences were analyzed by the Mothur software using the SILVA database. No significant differences between the EEC and TB microbiota for the Chao1 richness index (p = 0.6544), the Simpson evenness index (p = 0.4328) and the reciprocal Simpson alpha diversity (p = 0.4313) were noted (Kruskal-Wallis test). A significant difference (p = 0.009) for the Chao1 richness index between the right and left EEC was observed.

Micro-computed tomography (mCT) is an imaging technology based on X-rays that allows non-invasive visualization of objects at a microscopic scale, according to their radiopacity and in three dimensions (3D). Likewise, it allows the subsequent execution of morphological and quantitative analysis of the objects, such as, for example, the determination of the relative mineral density (MD). The present work aimed to describe the MD of feline teeth using mCT. The studied sample consisted of four European Shorthair cats, from which nine canine teeth were extracted per medical indication. These teeth were evaluated through dental radiography before and after their extraction. Using mCT and the CTAn software, the values of the relative mineral density of the root of each tooth and of specific segments corresponding to the coronal, middle, and apical thirds of the root were determined. Mean MD of root tissues was 1.374 &#177; 0040 g&#183;cm[-3], and of hard root, tissues was 1.402 &#177; 0.035 g&#183;cm[-3]. Through mCT, it was possible to determine the mean MD values of feline canine teeth. The study of MD could become an ancillary method for the diagnosis and characterization of dental pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Galectins have been found to be involved in various reproductive processes, including placental dysfunction, but this has not been investigated in the horse. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess alterations in galectin expression of the abnormal placenta in pregnant mares. Next-generation RNA sequencing was performed on the postpartum chorioallantois of two placental pathologies following clinical cases of ascending placentitis (n = 7) and focal mucoid placentitis (n = 4), while chorioallantois from healthy postpartum pregnancies (n = 8; 4 control samples per disease group) served as the control. When evaluating ascending placentitis, both galectin-1 (p &lt; 0.001) and galectin-3BP (p = 0.05) increased in the postpartum chorioallantois associated with disease, while galectin-8 (p &lt; 0.0001) and galectin-12 (p &lt; 0.01) decreased in the diseased chorioallantois in comparison with those in the control. In mares with focal mucoid placentitis, numerous galectins increased in the diseased chorioallantois, and this included galectin-1 (p &lt; 0.01), galectin-3BP (p = 0.03), galectin-9 (p = 0.02), and galectin-12 (p = 0.04), in addition to a trend toward increases in galectin-3 (p = 0.08) and galectin-13 (p = 0.09). In contrast, galectin-8 expression decreased (p = 0.04) in the diseased chorioallantois in comparison with that of the controls. In conclusion, galectins alter in abnormal placentae with variations observed among two forms of placental pathologies. These cytokine-like proteins may further our understanding of placental pathophysiology and warrant attention as potential markers of placental inflammation and dysfunction in the horse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977258</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Use of Ovarian Fluid as Natural Fertilization Medium for Cryopreserved Semen in Mediterranean Brown Trout: The Effects on Sperm Swimming Performance.</Title>	<Abstract>D-532 fertilization solution is generally used to replace the water or ovarian fluid during artificial reproductive practices in salmonids due to its ability to boost sperm motility and increase fertilization rates compared with natural activation media. However, the maintenance of ovarian fluid in a reproductive microenvironment gives it the advantage of protecting the eggs from potential harmful factors from the external environment and simplifying the field operations related to its removal when D-532 is used alone. In light of this, the aim of the present study was to investigate in vitro, for the first time, the effect of ovarian fluid (OF 100%) on post-thaw sperm swimming performance of Mediterranean trout, comparing it with D-532 and a mixed solution of 50% D-532 and 50% ovarian fluid (OF 50%). The percentage of motile spermatozoa and movement duration was significantly increased in OF 100% and OF 50% compared with D-532. Sperm velocity was higher in D-532, but significant differences were recorded only with OF 100%. In conclusion, these results suggest that the presence of ovarian fluid alone or in combination with D-532 in an artificial microenvironment of reproduction represents a key factor in potentially increasing fertilization success when the frozen semen of Mediterranean brown trout is used.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977259</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>RT-LAMP as Diagnostic Tool for Influenza-A Virus Detection in Swine.</Title>	<Abstract>Point-of-care diagnostic technologies are becoming more widely available for production species. Here, we describe the application of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect the matrix (M) gene of influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S). M-specific LAMP primers were designed based on M gene sequences from IAV-S isolated in the USA between 2017 and 2020. The LAMP assay was incubated at 65 &#176;C for 30 min, with the fluorescent signal read every 20 s. The assay's limit of detection (LOD) was 20 M gene copies for direct LAMP of the matrix gene standard, and 100 M gene copies when using spiked extraction kits. The LOD was 1000 M genes when using cell culture samples. Detection in clinical samples showed a sensitivity of 94.3% and a specificity of 94.9%. These results show that the influenza M gene RT-LAMP assay can detect the presence of IAV in research laboratory conditions. With the appropriate fluorescent reader and heat block, the assay could be quickly validated as a low-cost, rapid, IAV-S screening tool for use on farms or in clinical diagnostic labs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, yaks were infected with wild-type (WT) (P0910) and OmpH-deficient (&#916;OmpH) P. multocida strains. The mutant strain was generated through the reverse genetic operation system of pathogens and proteomics technology. The live-cell bacterial count and clinical manifestations of P. multocida infection in Qinghai yak tissues (thymus, lung, spleen, lymph node, liver, kidney, and heart) were analyzed. The expression of differential proteins in the yak spleen under different treatments was analyzed using the marker-free method. We found that compared with the mutant strain, the titer of wild-type strains was significantly higher in tissues. Additionally, compared with other organs, the bacteria titer was significantly higher in the spleen. Compared with the WT p0910 strain, the mutant strain generated milder pathological changes in the tissues of yak. Proteomics analysis revealed that 57 of the 773 proteins expressed in P. multocida were significantly differentially expressed between the &#916;OmpH and P0910 groups. Of the 57, 14 were over-expressed, whereas 43 were under-expressed. The differentially expressed proteins in the &#916;ompH group regulated the ABC transporter (ATP-powered translocation of many substrates across membranes) system, the two-component system, RNA degradation, RNA transcription, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinones, oxidative phosphorylation (citrate cycle) as well as fructose and mannose metabolism. The relationship among 54 significantly regulated proteins was analyzed using STRING. We found that WT P0910 and &#916;OmpH of P. multocida infection activated the expression of ropE, HSPBP1, FERH, ATP10A, ABCA13, RRP7A, IL-10, IFN-&#947;, IL-17A, EGFR, and dnaJ. Overall, deletion of the OmpH gene weakened the virulence but maintained the immunogenicity of P. multocida in yak. The findings of this study provide a strong foundation for the pathogenesis of P. multocida and the management of related septicemia in yaks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The duration of the examination and the amount of alcohol used in each case may vary depending on several factors. The aim of this study is to describe the breath alcohol test results obtained by veterinarians performing abdominal ultrasound on horses. Six volunteers were enrolled, after written consent, and a Standardbred mare was used for the whole study protocol. Each operator performed a total of 6 ultrasounds by pouring the ethanol solution from a jar or by spray application, for a duration of 10, 30, and 60 min. An infrared breath alcohol analyzer was used immediately after completing the ultrasonography and at 5-min intervals until a negative result was obtained. Positive results were obtained for 0-60 min after the procedure. A statistically significant difference was found between the groups that used more than 1000 mL, 300-1000 mL, and less than 300 mL of ethanol. No significant differences were observed between the type of ethanol administration and the time of exposure. Based on this study, equine vets who perform ultrasound on horses can test positive at the breath alcohol test for up to 60 min following ethanol exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This highly infectious disease causes large economic losses annually and worldwide. AOAV-1 does not only infect poultry, but it has a very broad host range and has been detected in over 230 bird species to date. A distinct group of viral strains within AOAV-1 are pigeon-adapted strains, also named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1). AOAV-1 is transmitted through the feces of infected birds and secretions from the nasal and oral cavities and eyes. It is worth mentioning that wild birds can transmit the virus to captive birds, especially feral pigeons to poultry. Therefore, early and sensitive detection of this virus-including the monitoring of pigeons-is of utmost importance. A variety of molecular methods for the detection of AOAV-1 already exist, but the detection of the F gene cleavage site of currently circulating PPMV-1 strains has not proven to be particularly sensitive or suitable. As presented here, by modifying the primers and probe of an already established real-time reverse-transcription PCR, the sensitivity could be increased, allowing for a more reliable detection of the AOAV-1 F gene cleavage site. Furthermore, it becomes clear how important it is to constantly monitor and, if necessary, adapt existing diagnostic procedures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ninety-four one-day-old laying chickens underwent free feeding and drinking water for three days. Then, fourteen laying chickens were randomly selected as the control group, and sixteen laying chickens were selected as the model group. Sixteen laying chickens in the rest were randomly selected as the intervention group of CASP. Chickens in the intervention group were given CASP by the oral administration (0.25 g/kg/d) for 10 days, the control and model groups were given the same amount of physiological saline. During the 8th and 10th days, laying chickens in the model and CASP intervention group were subcutaneously injected with CS at the neck. In contrast, those in the control group were subcutaneously injected with the same amount of normal saline simultaneously. Except for the control group, the layer chickens in the model and CASP intervention groups were injected with LPS after CS injection on the 10th day of the experiment. In contrast, those in the control group were injected with the same amount of normal saline at the same time. 48 h after the experiment, the liver samples of each group were collected, and the liver injury was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy. And the cecum contents of six-layer chickens in each group were collected, and the intervention mechanism of CASP on the liver injury from the perspective of the intestine was analyzed by the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing technology and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) detection of cecal contents based on Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and their association analysis was carried out. The results showed that the structure of chicken liver in the normal control group was normal, while that in the model group was damaged. The structure of chicken liver in the CASP intervention group was similar to the normal control group. The intestinal floras in the model group were maladjusted compared to the normal control group. After the intervention of CASP, the diversity, and richness of chicken intestinal floras changed significantly. It was speculated that the intervention mechanism of CASP on the chicken liver injury might be related to the abundance and proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Compared with the model group, the indexes of ace, chao1, observed species, and PD whole tree of chicken cecum floras in the intervention group of CASP were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). The contents of acetic acid, butyric acid, and total SCFAs in the intervention group of CASP were significantly lower than those in the model group (p &lt; 0.05), and the contents of propionic acid and valeric acid in the intervention group of CASP were significantly lower than those in the model group (p &lt; 0.05) and normal control group (p &lt; 0.05). The correlation analysis showed that the changes in the intestinal floras were correlated with the changes in SCFAs in the cecum. It is confirmed that the liver-protecting effect of CASP is indeed related to the changes in the intestinal floras and SCFAs content in the cecum, which provides a basis for screening liver-protecting alternative antibiotics products for poultry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These might increase the requirement for vitamin E and trace elements. To examine whether supplementation of vitamin E, selenium or copper, zinc, and manganese complex would help transition dairy cows to achieve greater reproduction performance by overcoming the immune function and postpartum disorders in subtropical Taiwan. A total of 24 Holstein Friesian dairy cows were enrolled in this study and divided into three groups (n = 8 cows/group): treatment 1 supplemented with organic selenium and vitamin E (SeE), treatment 2 supplemented with organic copper, zinc, and manganese complex (CZM) and control (CON). The results showed SeE supplementation improved immune function, reproductive performance, and milk yield, but not negative energy balance status. Supplementation of CZM improved milk yield and energy regulation through antioxidative capacity and immune function, but had no influence on reproductive performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Milk and jugular blood samples were collected from eight healthy cows every other month from the beginning to the end of their lactation period. Samples of airborne dust were also collected to determine whether the cowshed microbiota could affect milk microbiota. Milk yield peaked in the first two months and gradually decreased as the lactation period progressed. Milk fat, protein, and solids-not-fat contents were low in the first month, and then increased during the middle and late lactation periods. In the first month, plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), haptoglobin (Hp), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were elevated, and high abundances of Burkholderiaceae and Oxalobacteraceae were observed in milk and airborne dust microbiota. The finding that contamination of the environmental microbiota in milk was coupled with elevated plasma NEFA, Hp, and AST levels indicated that impaired metabolic function during the early lactation period may increase the invasion of opportunistic bacteria. This study can affirm the importance of feeding and cowshed management and should provide a helpful addition to improving Jersey cow farming.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three hundred eighty-eight blood samples and 3037 ticks were collected from 388 roaming, and free-ranging owned dogs at residential sites in Taiwan between January 2015 and December 2017. The prevalence of B. gibsoni and B. vogeli was 15.7% (61/388) and 9.5% (37/388), respectively. Most positive B. gibsoni dogs were found in the northern part of the country 56/61 (91.8%), whereas a few were found in the middle 5/61 (8.2%). Babesia vogeli infection rates were 10%, 3.6%, and 18.2% in the northern, central, and southern regions, respectively. Five species of ticks were found: Rhipicephalus sanguineus (throughout Taiwan), Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides (in the north), Haemaphysalis hystricis (in the north and middle of Taiwan), and Amblyomma testidunarium and Ixodes ovatus (both in the north). None of the dogs in the south were infected with B gibsoni, which correlated with the absence of H. hystricis, a tick recently identified as the local vector for B gibsoni. Babesia vogeli was more equally distributed, coinciding with R. sanguineus, a tick that is present throughout Taiwan. Anaemia was detected in 86.9% of infected dogs; among these dogs, approximately 19.7% showed severe anaemia (HCT &lt; 20). These findings provide useful advice for owners regarding outdoor activities with their dogs and local veterinarians with a regional differential diagnosis of babesiosis in Taiwan.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study objective was to utilize gross necropsy and histopathology to determine the frequency of pulmonary lesions from three major syndromes and agreement between gross and histopathological diagnosis. A cross sectional, observational study was performed at six U.S. feedyards using a full systematic necropsy to assess mortalities during summer 2022. A subset of mortalities had four lung samples submitted for histopathological diagnosis. Gross necropsy was performed on 417 mortalities, 402 received a gross diagnosis and 189 had a histopathological diagnosis. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate pulmonary diagnosis frequency based on method (gross/histopathology), and generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate agreement between histopathological and gross diagnoses. Using gross diagnosis, bronchopneumonia represented 36.6% of cases with acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pneumonia representing 10.0% and 35.8%, respectively. Results identified bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pneumonia as a frequent syndrome which has only been recently reported. Histopathological diagnosis had similar findings; bronchopneumonia represented 32.3% of cases, with acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pneumonia representing 12.2% and 36.0%, respectively. Histopathological diagnosis tended (p-VALUE = 0.06) to be associated with gross diagnosis. Pulmonary disease was common and both diagnostic modalities illustrated three primary syndromes: bronchopneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, and bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pneumonia with similar frequencies. Improved understanding of pulmonary pathology can be valuable for evaluating and adjusting therapeutic interventions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to identify gastrointestinal parasites and assess their prevalence and the potential risk for humans associated with consuming these animals. The research was conducted from August to December 2019. Parasitological analyses were carried out on the feces and intestines of 113 wild animals, including antelopes (24), duikers (58), porcupines (18), small monkeys (Cercopithecus) (8), nandinia (2), pangolin (1), genet (1), and a crocodile (1), from the Zadi&#233; Department in the province of Ogoou&#233;-Ivindo in the northeast of Gabon. The results revealed 15 taxa of gastrointestinal parasites, including nine nematodes: Strongylids (61/113), Strongyloides spp. (21/113), Ascaris spp. (21/113), Trichuris spp. (39/113), Capillaria spp. (9/113), Protostrongylus spp. (5/113), Enterobius spp. (8/113), Toxocara spp. (7/113) and Mammomonogamus spp. (5/113); three species of protozoa, namely Balantidium spp. (12/113), Eimeria spp. (17/113), and Entamoeba spp. (9/113); two species of trematodes, namely Fasciola spp. (18/113) and Paramphistomum spp. (21/113); and cestode species, Taenia spp. (1/113). The prevalence of gastrointestinal parasitism in these animals was 85.84% (97/113). In addition, among these parasitic taxa, some are potential pathogens for humans, such as Ascaris spp., Balantidium spp., Entamoeba spp., and Taenia spp. The consumption of games, particularly offal, infested by these parasites, could threaten human health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In experiment 1, we performed 393 ovarian examinations by ultrasonography, addressed the existence of CL (&#8805;20 mm) and large follicle numbers, and classified cows into 1F (n = 229) and 2F (n = 164) groups. The 1F appearance rates were beyond 75% each day during 3 to 12 d after estrus. However, 2F appearance rates were beyond 75% each day during 15 to 24 d after estrus. In experiment 2, we performed 302 ovarian examinations by ultrasonography and classified cows into the 1F (n = 168) and 2F (n = 134) groups. Estrus detection was performed for 24 d after the ovarian examination in each cow. In the 2F group, 75% of estrus occurred within 9 d of the ovarian examination. However, 75% of estrus occurred 10 d after the ovarian examination in 1F. Days from the ovarian examination to estrus were significantly shorter in the 2F (6.0 d; median, 7.2 &#177; 4.0 d; mean &#177; SD) than in the 1F (13 d, 12.4 &#177; 4.3 d) group. In conclusion, focusing on &#8805;10 mm follicle numbers with CL could be useful for predicting the estrus expression period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although cats with CPE were frequently encountered in clinics, the prognostic factors were poorly reported. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the association of physical examination and venous blood gas parameters with the survival of cats with CPE in an emergency hospital. Thirty-six cats with CPE were ultimately included in the present study, and eight of them died within 12 h after their presentation to our hospital. Statistical analyses of clinical parameters between cats that died within 12 h and those that survived for 12 h were conducted using Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. Cats that died within 12 h had significantly lower rectal temperatures and higher PvCO2 than those that did not die within 12 h. Moreover, hypotension and vasoconstrictor use were related to death within 12 h of presentation and higher PvCO2. These findings indicated the prognostic utility of body temperature and PvCO2, and the association between hypercapnia and the severity of CPE or hypotension. A large number of prospective studies should be performed to validate these results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Proteomics allows the study of proteins present in a specific biologic substrate, and fecal proteomic investigations have been recently implemented to study GI diseases in dogs. In the present study, the fecal protein profiles of eight dogs suffering from acute uncomplicated diarrhea at the time of inclusion was investigated for the first time, and then the same patients were followed, replicating two further evaluations at two subsequent time points (after 2 and 14 days from the first presentation), with the aim of gaining possible new insights regarding the pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal environment during such conditions. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed, followed by mass spectrometry. Nine spots, corresponding to four (groups of) proteins (i.e., albumin, alkaline phosphatase, chymotrypsin-C-like, and some immunoglobulins), showed significant differences at two or more of the three time points investigated, almost all behaving similarly and decreasing at T1 (2 days after the onset of the condition) and significantly increasing at T2 (14 days after the onset), mainly evidencing a reaction of the organism. Further studies including a greater number of patients and possibly different techniques are needed to confirm the present findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Antileishmanial drugs present issues associated with drug toxicity and increasing parasite resistance. Therefore, the study of this parasite with a focus on new potential drug targets is extremely useful. Accordingly, we purified and characterized a transglutaminase (TGase) from L. infantum promastigotes. While Tgases are known to be involved in cell death and autophagy, it appears that these functions are very important for parasites' virulence. For the first time, we showed a Ca[2+]- and GTP-dependent TGase in Leishmania corresponding to a 54 kDa protein, which was purified by two chromatographic steps: DEAE-Sepharose and Heparin-Sepharose. Using polyclonal antibodies against a 50-amino-acid conserved region of the catalytic core of human TGase 2, we revealed two other bands of 66 and 75 kDa. The 54 kDa band appears to be different from the previously reported TGase, which was shown to be Ca[2+]- independent. Future research should address the identification of the purified enzyme sequence and, subsequently, its cloning to more comprehensively investigate its pathophysiological function and possible differences from mammal enzymes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we investigated porcine CD163 in mediating the adhesion and immune response of G. parasuis using in vitro host-bacteria interaction models. CD163-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells (CHO-K1) showed obvious subcellular localization in the cytoplasm, especially in the cytomembrane. Although detection using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the bacterial adhesion, there was no significant difference in the adhesion of G. parasuis to CHO-K1 cells between the presence and absence of CD163. In addition, similar results were observed in 3D4/21 cells. Meanwhile, bindings of G. parasuis to nine synthetic peptides, the bacterial binding motifs within SRCR domains of CD163, were weak based on a solid-phase adhesion assay and agglutination assay. Moreover, CD163 had no effect on the expression of G. parasuis-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, INF-&#947;, IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-&#946;) in CHO-K1 cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that porcine CD163 plays a minor role in sensing G. parasuis infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Administering antibiotic feeds can effectively treat vAh infections, but it is imperative to discern new approaches and better understand the mechanics of infection for this bacterium. As such, the persistence of vAh in pond sediments was determined by conducting laboratory trials using sediment from four commercial catfish ponds. Twelve chambers contained sterilized sediment, vAh isolate ML-09-119, and 8 L of water maintained at 28 &#176;C and were aerated daily. At 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days, and every 7th day post-inoculation for 28 days, 1 g of sediment was removed, and vAh colony forming units (CFU) were enumerated on ampicillin dextrin agar. Viable vAh colonies were present in all sediments at all sampling periods. The vAh growth curve peaked (1.33 &#177; 0.26 &#215; 10[9] CFU g[-1]) at 96 h post-inoculation. The population plateaued between days 14 and 28. No correlations were found between CFU g[-1] and physiochemical sediment variables. This study validated the ability of vAh to persist within pond sediments in a laboratory setting. Further research on environmental factors influencing vAh survivability and population dynamics in ponds is needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>36977277</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Role of Dietary Inclusion of Phytobiotics and Mineral Adsorbent Combination on Dairy Cows' Milk Production, Nutrient Digestibility, Nitrogen Utilization, and Biochemical Parameters.</Title>	<Abstract>Our research purpose was to study the effect of the inclusion of a combination of phytobiotics in the form of dry Fucus vesiculosus grits (FG) and a mineral adsorbent from the heat-treated mineral shungite (TMS) on milk productivity, nutrient digestibility, and biochemical parameters of the Suksun dairy cows. A total of 80 dry-hardy cows of the Suksun breed were divided into four groups (20 heads each), balanced primarily by breed, age, body weight, body condition score, and indicators of milk yield for the previous lactation. The selected cows were with an average live body weight of 512.0 &#177; 1.28 kg, BCS 3.0-3.5, and parities of 6250 kg milk. The control group (CON) were fed the basic ration only; the second (TMS), third (FG), and fourth (TMS + FG) groups were fed the basic ration provided by 50 g of the mineral adsorbent from heat-treated shungite, 100 g of Fucus grits (Fucus vesiculosus), 50 g of the mineral adsorbent from heat-treated shungite, and 100 g of dry grits from Fucus vesiculosus, respectively. The total protein content in milk was significantly higher in the group receiving Fucus vesiculosus by 0.05% and the group receiving a combination of mineral adsorbent and Fucus vesiculosus by 0.03%. The percentage of milk fat content recorded the highest significant value in (TMS) group when compared to the control and represented (4.37 vs. 3.95). The group of cows that received (TMS + FG) revealed a significant difference in the digestibility of both ether extract and crude fiber when compared to the control group and represented (54.74 vs. 51.71 and 60.68 vs. 55.15%), respectively. The cows supplemented with a mineral adsorbent or a combination of mineral adsorbent and Fucus vesiculosus revealed a significant difference in the digestibility of ether extract and crude fiber in the group receiving TMS + FG by 3.0% (p &lt; 0.05) and 5.5% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The intake of nitrogen with the diet increased in (FG) and (TMS + FG) groups by 11.3 g (p &lt; 0.05) and 13.4 g (p &lt; 0.05) of nitrogen. There was an increase (p &lt; 0.05) in the concentration of rumen ammonia in the control group compared to the other groups. The glucose content of those cows that received FG and TMS + FG combination increased (p &lt; 0.05) by 0.76 mmol/L and 0.90 mmol/l in relation to the control group. The globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and the level of triglycerides revealed a significant difference between the different experimental groups. In brief, the inclusion of a combination of phytobiotics in the form of dry Fucus vesiculosus grits and a mineral adsorbent from the heat-treated mineral shungite in Suksun dairy cows' diets improved milk composition, digestibility of nutrients, utilization of nitrogen, and did not cause deleterious effects on blood biochemical indicators.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36977278</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Host PTX3 Protein and Bacterial Capsule Coordinately Regulate the Inflammatory Response during Streptococcus suis Infection.</Title>	<Abstract>Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a noteworthy zoonotic pathogen that has been responsible for large economic losses in pig production and a great threat to human health. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is an essential regulator of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens; however, its role during SS2 infection is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the SS2 strain HA9801 induced a significant inflammatory response in the mouse air pouch model; this response was amplified by the treatment of exogenous PTX3 simultaneously in terms of the results of inflammatory cell recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 production. In addition, PTX3 facilitated the phagocytosis of macrophage Ana-1 against SS2 strain HA9801. The supplementation of exogenous PTX3 significantly reduced the bacterial loads in a dose-dependent manner in lungs, livers and bloods of SS2-infected mice compared to the samples with HA9801 infection alone; this finding indicated that PTX3 may facilitate the bacterial clearance through enhancing the host inflammatory response during SS2 infection. Both PTX3 and SS2 capsular polysaccharide (CPS2) were required for the robust inflammatory response, implying that the host PTX3 protein and SS2 surface CPS2 modulate the host innate immune response in concert. All of these results suggested that PTX3 is a potential novel biological agent for the SS2 infection; however, the recommended dose of PTX3 must be evaluated strictly to avoid inducing an excessive inflammatory response that can cause serious tissue injury and animal death.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The results showed that after an EDTA injection, the number of activated neutrophils in the peripheral blood was significantly higher than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the serum IL-6 level was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) was inhibited (p &lt; 0.05), but returned to a normal level one week after the injection. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) levels were consistently higher after the injection and significantly higher than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). CuZn-SOD, TNOS activity, serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were significantly higher than before the injection (p &lt; 0.05). Combining the results of previous studies, the EDTA injection altered the metabolism and transcription of peripheral blood neutrophils. These changes enhance the respiratory burst function of neutrophils and alter the status of inflammatory and antioxidant indicators such as IL-6 and CuZn-SOD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this work is to compare AMR phenotypes and genotypes in resistant Escherichia coli and to determine how the resistance genes spread among the E. coli population on dairy farms in Qu&#233;bec, Canada. From an existing culture collection of E. coli isolated from dairy manure, a convenient selection of the most resistant isolates (a high level of multidrug resistance or resistance to broad-spectrum &#946;-lactams or fluoroquinolones) was analyzed (n = 118). An AMR phenotype profile was obtained for each isolate. Whole genome sequencing was used to determine the presence of resistance genes, point mutations, and mobile genetic elements. In addition, a subset of isolates from 86 farms was taken to investigate the phylogenetic relationship and geographic distribution of the isolates. The average agreement between AMR phenotypes and genotypes was 95%. A third-generation cephalosporin resistance gene (blaCTX-M-15), a resistance gene conferring reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (qnrS1), and an insertion sequence (ISKpn19) were detected in the vicinity of each other on the genome. These genes were harbored in one triplet of clonal isolates from three farms located &gt;100 km apart. Our study reveals the dissemination of resistant E. coli clones between dairy farms. Furthermore, these clones are resistant to broad-spectrum &#946;-lactam and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Soon after adoption, the pet and the caregiver showed severe gastrointestinal signs and needed hospitalization. Fecal PCR assays, selective cultures, and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed, and multi-drug resistant C. jejuni and C. upsaliensis were isolated from the feces of both. The same bacteria were also identified by FISH in the dog colonic biopsies collected during endoscopy. The puppy was prescribed a complete commercial diet for growing dogs, (30.00% CP, 21.00% EE, 1.2% Ca; 1% Phos; as fed) and treated with ciprofloxacin. The dog and the man healed uneventfully and tested negative for further fecal PCR analyses. This report focuses on dog nutritional management and explores the potential routes of exposure, with emphasis on emerging outbreaks related to current pet food fads. Our data support the One Health approach, where veterinarians, physicians, and owners are challenged to build effective stewardship to prevent the spread of zoonoses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study's objective was to measure tetracycline, sulfonamide, and erythromycin residues in beef, eggs, and honey sold as "antibiotic-free" at farmers' markets in East Tennessee (East TN) in the United States (U.S.). Between July and September 2020, 36 "antibiotic-free" food products (9 beef, 18 egg, and 9 honey products) were purchased from East TN farmers' markets and tested for tetracycline, sulfonamide, and erythromycin residues using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (cELISA). All beef, egg, and honey products had tetracycline residue; the median concentrations were 51.75, 30.25, and 77.86 &#181;g/kg, respectively. Sulfonamide residue was present in every sample of beef. Of 18 eggs, 11 eggs had detectable sulfonamide residue; the median concentrations were 3.50 and 1.22 &#181;g/kg in beef and eggs, respectively. Each sample of beef and honey contained erythromycin residue; the median concentrations were 3.67 and 0.68 &#181;g/kg, respectively. Overall, the median concentrations of tetracycline, sulfonamide, and erythromycin residues were below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) set in the U.S. for beef and eggs. Thus, the beef and eggs sold as "antibiotic-free" in East TN farmers' markets can be considered safe for consumption. Safety determination for honey could not be made because MRLs have not been set for honey in the U.S. Because these residues should not be expected in "antibiotic-free" food products, it is important to further investigate the potential sources of these residues in these products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study examined the effect of a ketogenic medium chain triglycerides (MCT)- enriched diet administered for one month on the fecal microbiota of epileptic (n = 11) (six with drug-sensitive epilepsy, DSE; five with drug-refractory epilepsy, DRE) and non-epileptic beagle dogs (n = 12). A significant reduction after diet in the relative abundance of bacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum was observed in all dogs. Epileptic dogs showed a higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus compared with non-epileptic dogs at baseline but these differences disappeared after diet. Epileptic dogs also showed a significantly higher abundance of Negativicutes and Selenomonadales after dietary intervention. Baseline microbiota patterns were similar in non-epileptic beagles and dogs with DSE but significantly different from dogs with DRE. In non-epileptic and DSE groups, the MCT diet decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and increased that of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, but the opposite effect was observed in dogs with DRE. These results suggest that the MCT diet effect would depend on individual baseline microbiota patterns and that ketogenic diets could help reduce gut microbiota differences between dogs with DRE and DSE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, thus far, no study has been conducted on the histopathology of canine splenic mass lesions in Republic of Korea. Herein, the prevalence of splenic diseases was analyzed in 137 canine splenic mass lesions via histopathological diagnosis, and the microscopic pattern associated with each disorder was described. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD31, CD3, PAX5, Iba1, and C-kit for a more accurate diagnosis of splenic tumors. The proportion of non-neoplastic disorders, including nodular hyperplasia (48.2%, n = 66) and hematoma (24.1%, n = 33), was 72.3%. Splenic tumors, including splenic hemangiosarcoma (10.2%, n = 14), splenic lymphoma (nodular and diffuse types, 8.0%, n = 11), splenic stromal sarcoma (7.3%, n = 10), myelolipoma (1.5%, n = 2), and mast cell tumors (0.7%, n = 1), accounted for 27.7% of cases. The results of this study will aid veterinary clinicians in communication with pet owners about prognoses, recommendations for splenectomy, and subsequent histopathological diagnoses. This study will facilitate further investigations with more detailed comparisons of splenic mass lesions between small- and large-breed dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease is well described in rabbits, but little is known about E. stiedae infection in wild rabbits. In this study, we investigated the presence of E. stiedae infection in wild rabbits from the island of Lemnos, Greece, where this species is overpopulated, and the effects of infection on common hepatic biomarkers. (2) Methods: We used liver impression smears to detect the coccidian oocysts, and we defined the liver biochemical profile of the infected individuals. (3) Results: Overall, 13.3% of the liver imprints examined were positive for the presence of coccidial oocysts. The activities of liver enzymes, that is, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamyltransferase (GGT), as well as globulins (GLOB), were increased while the concentrations of albumins (ALB), total proteins (TP) and the albumin to globulin (A/G) ratio were decreased in the infected individuals compared to the non-infected ones. (4) Conclusions: This study adds to the current knowledge on the pathogens affecting wild rabbits and those circulating in this population on the island of Lemnos, Greece. Moreover, we showed that E. stiedae infection exerts pathological effects on the hepatocyte integrity and liver function of wild rabbits, as reflected by the abnormal values of liver injury and dysfunction biomarkers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study we evaluated the expression of MET in two canine malignant melanoma (CMM) cell lines as well as in 30 CMM tissue samples that were collected from the clinical service at our institution. We were able to confirm the expression of the MET protein in both melanoma cell lines, and we demonstrated MET activation by its ligand, HGF, through phosphorylation, in Western blot analysis. We were also able to demonstrate, by immunohistochemistry, the expression of MET in 63% of the tumor tissue samples analyzed, with the majority demonstrating a relatively low expression profile. We then evaluated the association of MET expression scores with histologic parameters, metastasis, and survival. While statistically significant associations were not found across these parameters, an inverse relationship between MET expression levels and time to lymph node versus distant metastasis was suggested in our cohort. These findings may require assessment in a larger group of specimens to further evaluate the role of MET expression in the homing of metastasis in lymph nodes versus that in distant organs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

BoLA-DRB3 polymorphism in BLV-infected cattle is associated with the proviral load (PVL), infectivity in the blood, development of lymphoma, and in utero infection of calves. Additionally, it is related to the PVL, infectivity, and anti-BLV antibody levels in milk. However, the effects of the BoLA-DRB3 allele and BLV infection on dairy cattle productivity remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of BLV infection and BoLA-DRB3 allele polymorphism on dairy cattle productivity in 147 Holstein dams raised on Japanese dairy farms. Our findings suggested that BLV infection significantly increased milk yield. Furthermore, the BoLA-DRB3 allele alone, and the combined effect of BLV infection and the BoLA-DRB3 allele had no effect. These results indicate that on-farm breeding and selection of resistant cattle, or the preferential elimination of susceptible cattle, does not affect dairy cattle productivity. Additionally, BLV infection is more likely to affect dairy cattle productivity than BoLA-DRB3 polymorphism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Disorders of sexual development (DSDs) are characterized by atypical sexual development leading to various abnormalities of the genital tract. Sex reversal (SR) syndromes are a type of DSD characterized by a discrepancy between chromosomal sex and gonadal development (testes/ovaries) and the presence or the absence of the SRY gene. A phenotypically female 8-year-old Jack Russell terrier dog was referred due to anomalous vaginal discharge and non-pruritic cutaneous bilateral symmetrical alopecia on the flanks. During abdominal palpation, a voluminous mass was detected in the left quadrant area, later confirmed by ultrasound. The owner decided to proceed with euthanasia and necropsy. In the abdominal cavity, the left gonad was increased in size, the right one and the uterus were decreased, and the vagina and vulva appeared to be thickened. Histologically, both gonads were revealed to be testes: the left one was affected by a double neoplastic component (sustentacular tumor and interstitial cell tumor), whereas the right gonad showed coarctated seminiferous tubules. PCR amplification of the genes SRY and AMELX revealed the absence of the MSY region of the Y chromosome. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing a case of a testicular collision tumor in a DSD SRY-negative dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although Evans's modified Tobie and Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle media, for Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively, are the two commonly used media for both isolation and maintenance of strains in vitro, their preparation is expensive and laborious and requires fresh rabbit blood from housed animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro growth of both parasites with an alternative monophasic, blood-free, easy, and affordable medium called RPMI-PY, which was previously demonstrated suitable for the in vitro growth of Leishmania infantum. The potential growth of different Leishmania species and Trypanosoma cruzi was evaluated in traditional culture media versus RPMI-PY medium, and we recorded the protozoa parasites' morphology via orange acridine-ethidium bromide staining. The results of our study show that RPMI-PY medium can be used for Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania major, and Leishmania tropica species since in all the species except Leishmania braziliensis, the exponential growth of the parasite was observed, in many cases higher than conventional media. The staining confirmed not only their growth during the 72 h investigation but also the optimal morphology and viability of the protozoa in the RPMI-PY medium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The clinical histories of the buffaloes were characterized by progressive weight loss, recurrent tympany, abdominal distention (apple and pear shapes), anorexia, and scant feces. Buffalo 1 was submitted to orogastric intubation, and due to the recurrent tympany, an exploratory laparotomy. Buffalo 2 was submitted to ultrasound examination, and a segment of the pylorus was shown to be adhered to the eventration by ultrasonography. Both animals produced positive results for the atropine test. In the necropsy evaluation, Buffalo 1 was shown to have dilation of the esophagus, rumen, and reticulum; the ruminal contents of animal 1 were olive green and foamy with bubbles within the ingesta. On the other hand, Buffalo 2 was shown to have distention of the forestomach and abomasum; the complex rumen-reticulum and omasum contents were semi-liquid and had a yellowish color. In animal 2, in the eventration region, there was adherence to the pyloric region. The diagnosis of vagal indigestion was based on the history, clinical signs, and ultrasound and necropsy findings, in addition to the results of the atropine test.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A Study in the Araucanian Horse of Colombia.</Title>	<Abstract>The skull is divided into neurocranium and splanchnocranium, and its variation allows ecomorphological studies to learn about possible evolutionary and adaptive characteristics. The basicranial organization of the neurocranium and splanchnocranium modules was studied in a sample of 31 skulls from adult Araucanian horses by means of 2D geometric morphometric techniques. The neurocranium and splanchnocranium modules on the ventral aspect were analyzed separately using a set of 31 landmarks. The RV coefficient (the multivariate analog of a correlation) was estimated to analyze the independence of these two parts, as well as their morphological integration, using a two-block analysis of least squares. The study results confirm the modular development of the neurocranium and the splanchnocranium, the former being more stable than the latter as well as low morphological integration between the two. The development between both parties is structured in a modular way but allows relative independence. Now it would be interesting for future studies to add muscles (those that connect the cranial parts, but also the cervical), the hyoid apparatus, and the ossicles of the internal ear and the jaw and analyze if they behave as integrated modules between them. Since this research has been conducted at the subspecific breed level, it could be plausible that in other breeds, this integrative development was different.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

VEGF and decorin were detected using validated immunohistochemical methods on 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of canine STS. The tumours had been resected previously, with clinical outcome determined by questionnaire. Each slide was assessed by light microscopy and the pattern of immunostaining with VEGF and decorin determined. Patterns of immunostaining were then analysed to detect associations with outcome measures of local recurrence and tumour-related death. High VEGF immunostaining was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with both increased local recurrence and reduced survival time. The distribution of decorin immunostaining within the tumour was significantly associated with survival time (p = 0.04) and local tumour recurrence (p = 0.02). When VEGF and decorin scores were combined, STS with both high VEGF and low decorin immunostaining were more likely to recur or cause patient death (p &lt; 0.001). The results of this study suggest that immunostaining of VEGF and decorin may help predict the risk of local recurrence of canine STS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our earlier research group found that with clinical use of enrofloxacin, Pm was more likely to develop drug resistance to enrofloxacin. In order to better understand the resistance mechanism of Pm to enrofloxacin, we isolated PmS and PmR strains with the same PFGE typing in vitro, and artificially induced PmR to obtain the highly resistant phenotype, PmHR. Then transcriptome sequencing of clinically isolated sensitive strains, resistant and highly drug-resistant strains, treated with enrofloxacin at sub-inhibitory concentrations, were performed. The satP gene, of which the expression changed significantly with the increase in drug resistance, was screened. In order to further confirm the function of this gene, we constructed a satP deletion (&#916;Pm) strain using suicide vector plasmid pRE112, and constructed the C-Pm strain using pBBR1-MCS, and further analyzed the function of the satP gene. Through a continuously induced resistance test, it was found that the resistance rate of &#916;Pm was obviously lower than that of Pm in vitro. MDK99, agar diffusion and mutation frequency experiments showed significantly lower tolerance of &#916;Pm than the wild-type strains. The pathogenicity of &#916;Pm and Pm was measured by an acute pathogenicity test in mice, and it was found that the pathogenicity of &#916;Pm was reduced by about 400 times. Therefore, this study found that the satP gene was related to the tolerance and pathogenicity of Pm, and may be used as a target of enrofloxacin synergistic effect.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of clinical uterine findings and PBIE therapies, respectively, on pregnancy rate in mares. The analysis included records from 220 mares (390 cycles) inseminated at an artificial insemination (AI) center in Switzerland. Gynecological examinations were performed repeatedly before and after AI to determine cervical tone, uterine edema, and intrauterine fluid accumulation. Pregnancy rate was lower (p &lt; 0.001) in barren mares compared to mares of other reproductive status. A more flaccid cervix (p = 0.009) was observed at the time of ovulation in pregnant cycles, but there was no difference (p &gt; 0.05) regarding uterine edema. Intrauterine fluid accumulation reduced pregnancy rate (p = 0.002). Oxytocin administration had beneficial effects on pregnancy rate (p = 0.015), especially for barren mares, while uterine lavage did not have any effect (p &gt; 0.05). The results show that cervical tone and intrauterine fluid accumulation, but not its degree, are useful parameters for assessment of fertility in mares. Oxytocin treatment improved pregnancy rates in mares with PBIE while uterine lavage had a limited effect.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we focused on the oviduct histology of the pathogenesis of internal laying and egg-bound syndrome. We divided the aged laying hens into four groups according to the observation of the abdominal cavity and oviductal lumen: healthy, internal laying, egg-bound, and intercurrent. The percentages of healthy, internal laying, egg-bound, and intercurrent groups were 55%, 17.5%, 15%, and 12.5%, respectively. In all parts of the oviduct (i.e., infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, and uterus), the oviductal epithelium was composed of ciliated epithelial cells and secretory cells. The epithelial region lacking cilia was larger in the entire oviduct of the internal laying, and intercurrent groups than in the healthy group. In the internal laying, egg-bound, and intercurrent groups, significant T-cell infiltration was observed in the lamina propria of the entire oviduct. The morphological alteration of ciliated epithelial cells in the oviducts caused by inflammation may be the underlying cause of the pathogenesis of internal laying and egg-bound syndrome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104416</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Gastrointestinal Parasites of Domestic Mammalian Hosts in Southeastern Iran.</Title>	<Abstract>Gastrointestinal parasites (GIP) are a major cause of disease and production loss in livestock. Some have zoonotic potential, so production animals can be a source of human infections. We describe the prevalence of GIP in domestic mammals in Southeastern Iran. Fresh fecal samples (n = 200) collected from cattle (n = 88), sheep (n = 50), goats (n = 23), camels (n = 30), donkeys (n = 5), horse (n = 1), and dogs (n = 3) were subjected to conventional coprological examination for the detection of protozoan (oo)cysts and helminth ova. Overall, 83% (166/200) of the samples were positive for one or more GIP. Helminths were found in dogs, donkeys, sheep (42%), camels (37%), goats (30%), and cattle (19%), but not in the horse. Protozoa were found in cattle (82%), goats (78%), sheep (60%), and camels (13%), but not in donkeys, dogs, or the horse. Lambs were 3.5 times more likely to be infected by protozoa than sheep (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.05-11.66), whereas sheep were at higher odds of being infected by helminths than lambs (OR = 4.09, 95% CI: 1.06-16.59). This is the first study assessing the prevalence of GIP in domestic mammals in Southeastern Iran.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Among 165 recipient candidates who received 1 of 2s estrus synchronization treatments, 96 heifers and 43 cows were selected through rectal examination and used as recipients. The day before ET, the CL size and plasma P4 concentration were evaluated. The CL sizes and plasma P4 levels were not different between the selected and unselected candidates, and the pregnancy rates with the two synchronization methods were not different. However, the pregnancy rates were higher in heifers than in lactating cows, and also higher after ET performed from September to February than from March to August (p &lt; 0.05). The recipients with a CL larger than 1.5 cm showed statistically higher pregnancy rates, and although there was no statistical significance, the pregnancy rate was higher when the plasma P4 levels were between 2.0 and 4.0 ng/mL. Exposure to a stressful environment and repeated manipulations can reduce the success rate of ET, and recipient selection with an optimal CL size and P4 level can increase the success rate of ET.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The surgery was performed with the goal of avoiding major bleeding. An 11-year-old castrated indoor-only male Persian Chinchilla (5.5 kg) was presented with a month-long history of progressive tetraparesis for a left occipital lobe meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T2-weighted heterogeneously hyperintensity and a T1-weighted well-contrast enhancing extradural mass in the left occipital lobe of the brain. Cerebral angiographic data were obtained using magnetic resonance (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Advanced angiograms and virtual reconstruction of images revealed that the tumor was surrounded by the caudal parasagittal meningeal vein. A left caudal rostrotentorial craniotomy and en bloc resection of the tumor were performed, and histopathology revealed a meningioma. Complete neurological recovery was achieved within 10 days after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing CTA and MRA findings and favorable clinical outcomes after surgical management of a brain meningioma without severe perioperative complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease can induce stunting and immunosuppression in chicks by infecting bone marrow-derived stem cells, causing huge economic losses for the poultry industry. To determine the prevalence of CIA in Shandong Province, China, 854 suspected CIA samples were collected and analyzed in 13 cities in Shandong from 2020 to 2022. The PCR results showed that a total of 115 CAV were isolated. The CAV-positive rates were 17.21% (26/151) in 2020, 12.23% (35/286) in 2021, and 12.94% (54/417) in 2022, with severe mixed infections. Among them, CAV and fowl adenovirus (FAdV) were the most common, accounting for 40.86%. VP1 gene homology analysis showed that isolated strains shared 96.1-100% homology with the previously reported CAV strains. Genetic variation analysis showed that most of the isolated CAV strains were located in genotype A. These results indicate that CIA infection in Shandong chickens in recent years has been prevalent and mixed infections are common, but there were no significant genetic variations. Our results extend the understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of CIA in Shandong Province. They will offer new references for further study of the epidemiology and virus variation and the prevention and control of this disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Extract on Pathogenic Bacteria Isolated from Otitis Externa of Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The present study investigated the antimicrobial activity, total phenolic content, and proanthocyanidin concentration of ethanolic extracts from fresh leaves of Sempervivum tectorum L. The extracts were phytochemically analyzed and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The broth microdilution method was used to assess antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear swabs taken from dogs with otitis externa. Many compounds were present in the ethanolic aqueous extracts, which exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. They showed strong antibacterial activity against standard clinical Gram-positive strains such as S. aureus and Gram-negative strains such as P. aeruginosa. In our study, the obtained quantity of total phenolic compounds in the ethanol:water extract of leaves was 126.17 mg GAE/g. The proanthocyanidin concentration in the tested Sempervivum tectorum L. extracts was 15.39 mg PAC/g material. The high contents of total phenolics and proanthocyanidin indicated that these compounds contribute to antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of the tested S. tectorum L. extracts ranged from 1.47 to 63.75 &#181;g/mL, starting with 1.47 &#181;g/mL and 1.75 &#181;g/mL against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strains, respectively. Likewise, S. tectorum L. ethanol extract demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect against S. aureus clinical isolate with a median MIC of 23.25 &#181;g/mL and MBC of 37.23 &#181;g/mL; and bactericidal against S. aureus ATCC 25923 with the median MIC of 20.33 &#181;g/mL and MBC of 37.29 &#181;g/mL. In the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa clinical and standard strains, the expressed MIC and MBC values were 24.234 and 20.53 &#181;g/mL for MIC, and 37.30 and 37.02 &#181;g/mL for MBC, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104421</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Development of a Nomogram to Predict the Outcome for Patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma.</Title>	<Abstract>Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are common cutaneous or subcutaneous neoplasms in dogs. Most STSs are initially treated by surgical excision, and local recurrence may develop in almost 20% of patients. Currently, it is difficult to predict which STS will recur after excision, but this ability would greatly assist patient management. In recent years, the nomogram has emerged as a tool to allow oncologists to predict an outcome from a combination of risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for canine STSs and determine if the nomogram could predict patient outcomes better than individual tumour characteristics. The current study provides the first evidence in veterinary oncology to support a role for the nomogram to assist with predicting the outcome for patients after surgery for STSs. The nomogram developed in this study accurately predicted tumour-free survival in 25 patients but failed to predict recurrence in 1 patient. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values for the nomogram were 96%, 45%, 45%, and 96%, respectively (area under the curve: AUC = 0.84). This study suggests a nomogram could play an important role in helping to identify patients who could benefit from revision surgery or adjuvant therapy for an STS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Preliminary Cadaveric Study.</Title>	<Abstract>A new therapeutic approach for enophthalmos may be retrobulbar lipofilling. This study aims to standardize the intraconal filling technique and to evaluate the degree of eyeball displacement by computed tomography (CT). Skull CT was performed on six dog cadavers before and after intraconal injection of two 5% iodinated, viscoelastic solutions, one per eye, using an ultrasound-guided supratemporal approach. The volume to be injected was calculated using formulas for retrobulbar cone anesthesia. After CT, the dogs underwent necropsy and histopathology to evaluate damages that eventually occurred to retrobulbar structures. Eyeball displacement was estimated using two CT-based methods, named M1 and M2. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed no significant difference between the two injected materials in both M1 (p &gt; 0.99), and M2 (lateral p = 0.84 and rostral p = 0.84 displacement). A statistically significant difference was found between the pre- and post-injection group M1 (p = 0.002), M2 (p = 0.004) for the lateral and (p = 0.003) for rostral displacement. Although the slight eyeball displacement, the retrobulbar filling can lead to enophthalmos resolution. Compared to M1, the M2 method has better-defined anatomical landmarks. Further, preclinical in vivo studies are necessary to assess retrobulbar filling efficacy and safety.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An effective mean of predicting survival despite treatment would be helpful for making euthanasia decisions in poor prognosis cases. The objective was to develop a nomogram for prediction of death or culling in the 60 days following a severe mastitis episode in dairy cows at first veterinary visit in farm settings. A total of 224 dairy cows presenting severe clinical mastitis and examined for the first time by a veterinarian were included in a prospective study. Clinical and laboratory (complete blood cell count, L-lactate, cardiac troponin I, milk culture) variables were recorded. Animals were followed for 60 days. A nomogram was built with an adaptive elastic-net Cox proportional hazards model. Performances and relevance were evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Harrell's concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and misclassification cost term (MCT). The nomogram included: lactation number, recumbency, depression intensity, capillary refilling time, ruminal motility rate, dehydration level, lactates concentration, hematocrit, band neutrophils count, monocyte count, and milk bacteriology. The AUC and C-index showed a good calibration and ability to discriminate. The DCA suggested that the nomogram was clinically relevant. Euthanizing animals having less than 25% probability of survival is economically optimal. It could be used for early euthanasia decisions in animals that would not survive despite treatment. To facilitate the use of this nomogram by veterinarians, a web-based app was developed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four crossbred dairy cows (467.6 &#177; 35.2 kg BW) were assigned to be supplemented with one of four levels of CHT according to a 4 &#215; 4 Latin square design. Dietary treatments included the control (without CHT supplementation) and CHT treatments that consisted of supplementation with 3.15, 6.30 and 9.45 g CHT/day. Rice straw was given ad libitum. The results showed that increasing levels of CHT tended to quadratically decrease rice straw intake (p = 0.06). However, total dry matter intake (DMI) and other nutrients were not different (p &gt; 0.05) among the dietary treatments. The apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) in cows with CHT treatments were higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those of control cows. Milk yield and milk composition were not different (p &gt; 0.05) among treatments. Lactose yield tended to increase linearly (p = 0.09) as CHT supplementation increased. Ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) were not different (p &gt; 0.05), but total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) increased linearly (p &lt; 0.05) as CHT levels increased. The somatic cell count (SCC) and somatic cell score (SCS) in the CHT treatments were different (p &lt; 0.01) than those in the control treatment. In conclusion, it appears that CHT supplementation improved feed utilization and influenced SCC in crossbred dairy cows. Long-term research is needed to confirm the benefit of CHT supplementation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Overall, 202 lambs from five breeds were evaluated. We identified eight nucleotide changes (seven substitutions and one deletion) in three variants of IGF1 5'UTR by SSCP analysis and nucleotide sequencing. It was found that the P1 variants had a unique deletion (g.171328230 delT), while the P2 variants were identified by SNPs rs401028781, rs422604851, and g.171328404C &gt; Y. The P3 variants possessed one heterozygous substitution (g.171328260G &gt; R) and three homozygous substitutions (g.171328246T &gt; A, g.171328257T &gt; G, g.171328265T &gt; C) not observed in P1 or P2. Based on the growth and production traits, a statistically significant difference was found only in chest width at weaning (p &lt; 0.01) and leg circumferences at yearling (p &lt; 0.05). The P1 variants showed a leaner profile with a higher Musculus longissimus dorsi, but the differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). The P2 variants had a higher percentage of rack (p &lt; 0.01) and loin (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no discernible difference between variants, even though the P3 variants had a higher percentage of neck and leg and the P1 variants had a higher percentage of the shoulder. It is concluded that nucleotide changes in IGF1 5'UTR could be exploited utilizing a marker-assisted selection technique to increase growth and production attributes, as well as carcass quality traits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Successful responses to faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) in dogs with non-responsive CE have been reported in two case series. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical effects of FMT as an adjunctive therapy in a larger population of dogs with CE. Forty-one dogs aged 0.6-13.0 years (median 5.8) under treatment for CE at one referral animal hospital were included. Dogs were treated with 1-5 (median 3) FMTs as a rectal enema at a dose of 5-7 g/kg body weight. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index (CIBDAI) was compared at baseline versus after the last FMT. Stored faecal samples (n = 16) were analysed with the dysbiosis index. CIBDAI at baseline was 2-17 (median 6), which decreased to 1-9 (median 2; p &lt; 0.0001) after FMT. Subsequently, 31/41 dogs responded to treatment, resulting in improved faecal quality and/or activity level in 24/41 and 24/41 dogs, respectively. The dysbiosis index at baseline was significantly lower for good responders versus poor responders (p = 0.043). Results suggest that FMT can be useful as an adjunctive therapy in dogs with poorly responsive CE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, PCR assays are not available for other important emerging respiratory bacteria, such as Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT). We aimed to fill this gap by establishing a new duplex PCR method for the simultaneous detection of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and ORT. Multiplex primer design software was used to select the compatible multiplex primer pairs. It was determined that an annealing temperature of 65 &#176;C and an initial concentration of 2.5 pmol/&#181;L for each primer set were the most suitable conditions for multiplex PCR. The assay was confirmed to be specific, as it only detected the target pathogens, even in the presence of six non-target agents. The limit of detection was up to 10[3] copies/&#181;L of template DNA for both ILTV and ORT. In the screening of 304 field samples, 23, 88, and 44 were positive for both ILTV and ORT, solely for ILTV, and solely ORT, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The hypothesis that biochanin A inhibited the action of drug efflux pumps was tested by enumerating tetracycline-insensitive bacteria from steers in a subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) challenge. Steers (n = 3/group) treatment groups were forage only, SARA control, SARA with monensin (0.2 g d[-1]), and SARA with biochanin A (6.0 g d[-1]). As the steers were stepped up from the forage-only basal diet to 70% cracked corn, the number of rumen bacteria enumerated on two tetracycline-containing media types (nutrient glucose agar and tetracycline, and bile esculin azide and tetracycline) increased (p &lt; 0.05) from as little as 1.7(10[5]) to as great as 6.7(10[6]) cfu mL[-1] on the nutrient glucose agar in the SARA and monensin control groups. The biochanin A group maintained the same number of tetracycline-insensitive bacteria as the forage-only controls (p &gt; 0.05). The effects were similar to the more selective media type, but the differences were smaller. These results support the hypothesis that biochanin A inhibits the activity of drug efflux pumps in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Gadolinium-containing dimeglumine gadopentetate, or Gd-DTPA (Magnevist[&#174;], 0.6 mL/kg b.w.), was used. We observed mild and reversible toxicity related to the treatment. However, no significant tumor regression in response to the treatment was observed. In most cases, there was continued tumor growth. Overall clinical improvement after treatment was only temporary. The use of Gd-DTPA for NCT had no significant effects on the life expectancy and quality of life of animals with spontaneous tumors. Further experiments using more advanced gadolinium compounds are needed to improve the effect of GdNCT so that it can become an alternative to boron neutron capture therapy. Such studies are also necessary for further NCT implementation in clinical practice as well as in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 119 cattle from two breeds reared in Western Romania (64 Romanian Spotted and 55 Romanian Brown) were included in the research herd. A PCR-RFLP genotyping assay was used for the identification of the rs211032652 SNP variants. Shapiro's test and Levene's test were used to verify ANOVA assumptions and ANOVA and Tukey's test were employed to test the associations between PRL genotypes and five milk traits. Among the studied breeds, our results showed that PRL genotypes were significantly associated (p &lt; 0.05) with fat and protein percentage in the milk of Romanian Brown cattle. The AA genotype was associated with a higher fat percentage in milk (4.76 &#177; 0.28) compared to the GG genotype (4.04 &#177; 0.22, p = 0.048), as well as a higher protein percentage (3.96 &#177; 0.32% vs. 3.43 &#177; 0.15%, p = 0.027) in Romanian Brown cattle. Moreover, the PRL locus favored a significantly higher fat (p = 0.021) and protein (p = 0.028) percentage in the milk of Romanian Brown cattle compared to the Romanian Spotted breed, with a difference of 0.263% and 0.170%, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To date, most studies on the blood microbiome have focused on human health, but this topic is an expanding research area in animal health as well. This study aims to characterize the blood microbiome of both healthy dogs and those with chronic gastro-enteropathies. For this study, blood and fecal samples were collected from 18 healthy and 19 sick subjects, DNA was extracted through commercial kits, and the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced on the Illumina platform. The sequences were analyzed for taxonomic annotation and statistical analysis. Alpha and beta diversities of fecal microbiome were significantly different between the two groups of dogs. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that healthy and sick subjects were significantly clustered for both blood and fecal microbiome samples. Moreover, bacterial translocation from the gut to the bloodstream has been suggested because of found shared taxa. Further studies are needed to determine the origin of the blood microbiome and the bacteria viability. The characterization of a blood core microbiome in healthy dogs has potential for use as a diagnostic tool to monitor for the development of gastro-intestinal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirteen horses underwent general anesthesia with isoflurane and were randomly divided into two different groups, one of which received a dobutamine constant rate infusion (CRI) (1 &#181;g/kg bwt/min) and the other received an ephedrine CRI (20 &#181;g/kg bwt/min) when hypotension (&lt;60 mmHg) was identified, following up to 15 min after the blood pressure reached 70 mmHg. All horses were equipped with a pulmonary artery catheter and a peripheral artery catheter, and multiparameter monitoring commenced as soon as they were under mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded, while tissue perfusion markers (peripheral oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen partial pressure, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, arterial pH, arterial plasma bicarbonate concentration, arterial oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen content, arterial oxygen content, arteriovenous oxygen difference, oxygen delivery index, oxygen consumption index, and oxygen extraction ratio), serum lactate concentration, and troponin I concentrations were analyzed before the start of infusions (T0), when the blood pressure reached 70 mmHg (T1), and 15 min after T1 (T2). The time to restore the arterial pressure was similar in both groups (p &gt; 0.05); however, the heart rate was higher in the ephedrine group (p = 0.0098), and sinus bradyarrhythmia occurred in the dobutamine group. Furthermore, both experimental protocols increased cardiac output (p = 0.0012), cardiac index (p = 0.0013), systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.008), systemic vascular resistance index (p &lt; 0.001), and ameliorated perfusion markers. In the dobutamine group, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (p &lt; 0.001) and systolic index (p = 0.003) were elevated, while the arteriovenous oxygen difference was reduced in the ephedrine group (p = 0.02). Troponin I was used as a myocardial injury indicator, and did not differ between moments or between groups (p &gt; 0.05). We concluded that both drugs were effective and safe to treat anesthetic hypotension under the conditions of this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104434</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Development of a Real-Time TaqMan RT-PCR Assay for the Detection of NADC34-like Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus.</Title>	<Abstract>NADC34-like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus first appeared in 2017 in a herd of pigs in Liaoning Province, China. The virus was subsequently found in other provinces. Given the potential for this virus to cause an epidemic, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of NADC34-like PRRSV is required. The virus' ORF5 gene was artificially synthesized based on a Chinese reference strain, and specific primers/probes for the ORF5 gene were designed. Then, the amplified target fragment was cloned into the pMD19-T vector, and a series of diluted recombinant plasmids were used to generate a standard curve. An optimized real-time TaqMan RT-PCR method was established. The method was highly specific for NADC34-like PRRSV, without cross-reactions with other non-targeted pig viruses. The detection limit of this assay was 10[1] copies/&#956;L. The method had an efficiency of 98.8%, a squared regression value (R[2]) of 0.999, and showed a linear range of 10[3]-10[8] copies/&#956;L of DNA per reaction. This method was shown to be analytically specific and sensitive with a low intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation (&lt;1.40%). A total of 321 clinical samples were tested using the established method, and four were shown to be positive (1.24%). This study confirmed the existence of NADC34-like PRRSV and HP-PRRSV co-infection in Sichuan and provided a promising alternative tool for the rapid detection of NADC34-like PRRSV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104435</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Quality Assurance and Cost Reduction in Histopathology Laboratories Using Tissue Microarrays.</Title>	<Abstract>In the context of cost increases of both labor and consumables, cheaper and faster histopathology methods are needed. We implemented in our research laboratory the use of tissue microarrays (TMA) for the parallel processing and analysis of tissue samples. In this study, we used seven pre-processed, paraffinated biomimetic sectionable support matrices serving as "recipient" paraffin blocks to embed a total of 196 tissue cores from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples (serving as "donor" paraffin blocks) from seven different rabbit organs. These tissue samples were obtained using four different processing protocols: two 6 h protocols with xylene as the transition solvent, and two using butanol instead (one 10 h in duration and the other 72 h long). While the samples from protocols 1 and 2 (with xylene) quite regularly generated peeling of some of the cores from the slides (most likely because of substandard paraffin infiltration), butanol processing performed flawlessly for both processing protocols. Our proposed technique of using TMAs in the research laboratory brings with it a significant reduction in time and consumable costs (up to 77 and 64%, respectively), but also new challenges for all the upstream processes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The efforts to conserve FAnGR are minimal in Bhutan. In the pursuit of increasing livestock productivity, farmers are rearing livestock that narrows the range of genetic diversity. This review attempts to summarize the status of FAnGR and the efforts to conserve them. Some unique livestock breeds in Bhutan are Nublang (cattle breed), Yak, Saphak (pig breed), Yuta (horse breed), Merak-Saktenpa (horse breed), and Belochem (chicken breed). There was a drop in the yak, buffalo, equine, pig, sheep, and goat populations. Both in situ and ex situ conservation measures are in place for some of the breeds and strains (e.g., Nublang and traditional chicken). Conservation efforts are limited to the government, but other individuals, stakeholders and non-government organizations must play an increasing role in preserving genetic diversity. It is pertinent that Bhutan comes up with a policy framework to conserve its indigenous cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cutaneous forms are generally considered benign and may show various biological behaviours. This work reports a rare case of canine cutaneous melanoma showing parietal bone metastasis. Bone invasion in melanocytic tumours is often described in oral or visceral melanomas, but not in cutaneous forms. The patient (dog, male, mixed breed, 12 years) was initially presented for the surgical removal of a cutaneous tumour located on the skin of the carpal region of the right forelimb. Four months after, the patient returned with enlarged lymph nodes and acute respiratory failure. The patient was euthanized due to a decline in physical condition. The necropsy showed metastases in the affected forelimb, regional lymph node, splanchnic organs, parietal bone and meninges. Histopathological examination of tumour tissue samples revealed a mixture of pigmented and non-pigmented spindle and epithelioid melanocytes, while according to immunohistochemistry, the tumours showed a strong immunopositivity for VEGF and MMP-10, and a moderate positivity for MMP-2 expression. This case shows that cutaneous melanocytic tumours may show an aggressive malignant form with positive immunohistochemical reactions for multiple invasiveness factors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to compare the visual and automated evaluations of dipstick variables in canine urine samples. One hundred and nineteen urine samples were evaluated. Automated analysis was performed on a veterinary urine analyzer URIT-50Vet (URIT Medical Electronic) with UC VET13 Plus strips. Multistix 10 SG dipsticks (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) were used for visual evaluation, along with a refractometer (Clinical Refractometer Atago T2-Ne, Atago Co., Tokyo, Japan) for urine specific gravity measurements. A linear relationship was observed between the pH measurements (p = 0.2) of the two methods; the Passing-Bablok procedure was valid since neither proportional nor systematic significant errors were observed. Comparing the two methods, the correlation for urine specific gravity was poor (p = 0.01, CI 0.667-1.000). Moderate agreement was demonstrated for proteins (&#954; = 0.431), bilirubin (&#954; = 0.434) and glucose (&#954; = 0.450). Agreement was substantial for blood (&#954; = 0.620) and poor for leukocytes (&#954; = 0.100). Poor agreement was observed for ketones (&#954; = -0.006). Apart from the pH analysis, visual and automated dipstick urinalyses should not be used interchangeably. Multiple urine samples obtained from the same dog during the day should be evaluated using the same method to overcome erroneous results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104439</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Analysis of Various Facial Expressions of Horses as a Welfare Indicator Using Deep Learning.</Title>	<Abstract>This study aimed to prove that deep learning can be effectively used for identifying various equine facial expressions as welfare indicators. In this study, a total of 749 horses (healthy: 586 and experiencing pain: 163) were investigated. Moreover, a model for recognizing facial expressions based on images and their classification into four categories, i.e., resting horses (RH), horses with pain (HP), horses immediately after exercise (HE), and horseshoeing horses (HH), was developed. The normalization of equine facial posture revealed that the profile (99.45%) had higher accuracy than the front (97.59%). The eyes-nose-ears detection model achieved an accuracy of 98.75% in training, 81.44% in validation, and 88.1% in testing, with an average accuracy of 89.43%. Overall, the average classification accuracy was high; however, the accuracy of pain classification was low. These results imply that various facial expressions in addition to pain may exist in horses depending on the situation, degree of pain, and type of pain experienced by horses. Furthermore, automatic pain and stress recognition would greatly enhance the identification of pain and other emotional states, thereby improving the quality of equine welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In each of the eight cadavers, the basilar femoral neck fracture model was prepared on both sides of the femur. One side of the femur was stabilized with three 1.0 mm K-wires of an inverted triangle configuration (group T), and the other femur was stabilized with a vertical configuration (group V). Postoperatively, the placement of the K-wires was evaluated with radiographic and computed tomography (CT) images, and static vertical compressive loading tests were performed. The mean yield load and the lateral spread were significantly higher in group T compared to group V (p = 0.023 and &lt;0.001). On the cross-section of femoral neck at the level of the fracture line, the surface area between K-wires was significantly larger (p &lt; 0.001) and the mean number of cortical supports was significantly higher in group T (p = 0.007). In this experimental comparison, the inverted triangle configuration of three K-wires was more resistant to failure under axial loading than the vertical configuration for canine femoral neck fracture fixation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This systematic literature review answers the question: Is porcine kobuvirus a cause of gastrointestinal disease in young pigs? A case-control study showed that PKV was not associated with neonatal diarrhea. A cohort study suffered from a very small sample size (n = 5), and in an experimental trial, the effect of PKV inoculation could not be separated from the effect of being inoculated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. In 13 poorly defined observational studies, more than 4000 young pigs had been assigned a diarrhea status and their feces analyzed for PKV. Unfortunately, the studies lacked well-characterized unbiased samples, and thus the strongest possible inference from these studies was that a very strong association between PKV and diarrhea is unlikely. PKV was commonly detected in non-diarrheic pigs, and this could indicate that PKV is not a sufficient cause in itself or that reinfection of individuals with some immunological protection due to previous infections is common. Conclusively, there is a lack of good evidence of PKV being a cause of gastrointestinal disease, but the sparse available evidence suggests that PKV is of limited clinical importance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>37104443</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing of Gut Microbiota Affected by Four Probiotic Strains in Mice.</Title>	<Abstract>Probiotics, also referred to as "living microorganisms," are mostly present in the genitals and the guts of animals. They can increase an animal's immunity, aid in digestion and absorption, control gut microbiota, protect against sickness, and even fight cancer. However, the differences in the effects of different types of probiotics on host gut microbiota composition are still unclear. In this study, 21-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice were gavaged with Lactobacillus acidophilus (La), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lp), Bacillus subtilis (Bs), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), LB broth medium, and MRS broth medium. We sequenced 16S rRNA from fecal samples from each group 14 d after gavaging. According to the results, there were significant differences among the six groups of samples in Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Desferribacter (p &lt; 0.01) at the phylum level. Lactobacillus, Erysipelaceae Clostridium, Bacteroides, Brautella, Trichospiraceae Clostridium, Verummicroaceae Ruminococcus, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Shigella, and Clostridium Clostridium differed significantly at the genus level (p &lt; 0.01). Four kinds of probiotic changes in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in mice were observed, but they did not cause changes in the diversity of the gut microbiota. In conclusion, the use of different probiotics resulted in different changes in the gut microbiota of the mice, including genera that some probiotics decreased and genera that some pathogens increased. According to the results of this study, different probiotic strains have different effects on the gut microbiota of mice, which may provide new ideas for the mechanism of action and application of microecological agents.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

GTs were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 10/group). Transected GTs were repaired with a 3LP pattern alone or in conjunction with an epitendinous suture (ES), a 5-hole 1 mm PCL plate, a 5-hole 2 mm PCL plate, or a 5-hole 1.5 mm titanium plate. The yield, peak, and failure force, as well as the occurrence and force of 1-mm and 3-mm gapping were examined. The mean yield, peak, and failure force of the 3LP + titanium plate group were higher than that of other groups. The biomechanical properties of a 3LP + a 2 mm PCL plate were similar to 3LP + ES constructs in this model. In all specimens in all groups, 1 mm gap formation was observed. The frequency of 3 mm gap formation was 70% and 90% in the 3LP + 2 mm PCL plate group and the 3LP + 1.5 mm titanium plate group, respectively. Additional studies evaluating PCL plates to determine the effect on the healing and blood supply of tendon are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

FMT has been used in horses to manage various gastrointestinal disorders, such as colitis and diarrhea. To evaluate the current literature on the use of FMT in horses, including its efficacy, safety, and potential applications, the authors conducted an extensive search of several databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, published up to 11 January 2023. The authors identified seven studies that met their inclusion criteria, all of which investigated the FMT application as a treatment for gastrointestinal disorders such as colitis and diarrhea. The authors demonstrated that FMT was generally effective in treating these conditions. However, the authors noted that the quality of the studies was generally suboptimal and characterized by small sample sizes and a lack of control groups. The authors concluded that FMT is a promising treatment option for certain gastrointestinal disorders in horses. Nevertheless, more research is required to determine the optimal donor selection, dosing, and administration protocols, as well as the long-term safety and efficacy of FMT in horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104446</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Histopathological Analysis of Selected Organs of Rats with Congenital Babesiosis Caused by Babesia microti.</Title>	<Abstract>Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease with an increasing number of cases each year. Due to the non-specific symptoms of babesiosis, insightful analyses of the pathogenesis of babesiosis are still very important. Transmission of the disease occurs in a few ways, which makes laboratory diagnosis of piroplasmosis important. Complications associated with the infection can be tragic, especially in patients with immunological disorders. The aim of this study was the histopathological analysis of the spleen and kidney of young Wistar rats infected transplacentally with Babesia microti. Female rats were infected with a reference strain of B. microti (ATCC 30221), and then, birth 3-week-old males were euthanized with isoflurane. Subsequently, the material was collected at autopsy for microscopic and ultrastructural examination. Microscopic and ultrastructural analysis of the spleen and kidney showed degenerative changes within the organ parenchyma and the capsules surrounding the organ. Regenerative and reparative changes through mitotic divisions of parenchymal cells were also evident. Merozoites of B. microti were visible in the section of erythrocytes and the cells building the organ stroma. The results presented in this study proved the negative effects of B. microti on cells and tissues in rats with congenital babesiosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, if not properly managed, it can spread significant biological and chemical hazards, threatening both human and animal health. The effectiveness of risk control hugely relies on farmers' knowledge regarding safe manure management and on the application of suitable management practices. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and practices of Cypriot bovine farmers towards safer manure management, from its generation to its final use, in line with the One Health approach. Factors affecting farmers' knowledge and applied practices are also investigated through a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was developed and sent to all eligible bovine farmers in Cyprus (n = 353), and 30% (n = 105) of them returned the completed questionnaire. Results revealed there are some gaps in farmers' knowledge. The use of manure for fertilising crops dominated. Only half of the farmers stored manure in appropriate facilities, with 28.5% of them using a dedicated area with cement floors and 21.5% utilising leakproof tanks. The majority (65.7%) stored manure for more than three months before its use as a fertiliser in a dried form. In multiple regression analysis, education level and farming purpose were significant determinants of farmer knowledge. In conclusion, Cypriot farmers' knowledge must be reinforced to ensure proper manure management. The results highlight the importance of providing relevant training to farmers. Although the current practices partially decrease manure pathogens, interventions to promote the use of more effective treatment methods, such as biogas transformation and composting, would be beneficial.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we aim to evaluate the urinary proteins of female domestic dogs in the estrus and anestrus phases to evidence the presence of non-volatile chemical signals and to elucidate their identities. We collected urine samples from eight female dogs in the estrus and anestrus phases. A total of 240 proteins were identified in the urine samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS analysis). The comparison of the proteins revealed a significant difference between the estrus and anestrus urine. We identified proteins belonging to the lipocalin family of canines (beta-lactoglobulin-1 and beta-lactoglobulin-2, P33685 and P33686, respectively), one of whose function was the transport of pheromones and which was present only in the estrus urine samples. Moreover, proteins such as Clusterin (CLU), Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2), and Proenkephalin (PENK) were more abundant in the estrus urine when compared to the anestrus urine. LEAP2 was recently described as a ghrelin receptor antagonist and implicated in regulating food intake and body weight in humans and mice. Proenkephalin, a polypeptide hormone cleaved into opioid peptides, was also recognized as a candidate to determine kidney function. As of yet, none of these have played a role in chemical communication. Clusterin, an extracellular chaperone protecting from protein aggregation implicated in stress-induced cell apoptosis, is a plausible candidate in chemical communication, which is a claim that needs to be ascertained further. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD040418.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, it is a big concern for swine practitioners when designing the PRRSV diagnostics strategy in vaccinated farms. At the same time, the possibility of vaccine virus transmission from sows to their offspring is important to have in mind in order to limit the risk of recombination between different PPRSV-1 modified live virus vaccine (MLV1) when both sows and piglets have to be vaccinated. This study was conducted in five PRRSV-stable breeding herds. The selected farms presented different characteristics regarding production parameters and biosecurity management practices in order to be, as much as possible, representative of French swine production herds. In four different batches following a sow mass vaccination with a PRRSV-1 modified live virus vaccine (ReproCyc[&#174;] PRRS EU, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany), we failed to detect the vaccine virus in due-to-wean piglets in all of the herds. This should mean that the dissemination of the vaccinal strain is a rare event, even just after a sow vaccination, at least for the vaccine tested in our study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Additionally, the adequacy of plasma to reflect changes in the Zn intake is unclear. In the first part of this study, the plasma Zn concentrations of hospitalized horses and ponies (n = 538) were measured and evaluated for the impact of the age, sex, horse type, and internal diseases of the animals. In the second part, the effects of increasing dietary Zn chloride hydroxide and Zn methionine supplementations were assessed on the plasma and mane hair Zn concentrations of healthy horses (n = 2) and ponies (n = 8). Part 1: The age, sex, and horse type did not influence the plasma Zn concentrations. No effect of internal diseases was observed, with the exception of higher plasma Zn concentrations in animals with metabolic disorders compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Part 2: Both Zn supplements dose-dependently increased the Zn concentrations in the mane hair (p = 0.003), but not in the plasma of the horses and ponies. In conclusion, the plasma Zn concentrations were widely unaffected by nutritional and non-nutritional factors in equines, while mane hair samples better reflected the dietary Zn supply.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104451</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Bibliographical Mapping of Research into the Relationship between In Ovo Injection Practice and Hatchability in Poultry.</Title>	<Abstract>Recent advances in poultry practice have produced new tools enabling the poultry industry to increase productivity. Aiming at increasing production quality, varying protocols of in ovo injection facilitate the introduction of exogenous substances into the egg to complement the nutrients that support embryonic development up to hatching, which are already available in the internal and external compartments. Due to embryonic sensitivity, adding any substance into the egg can be either advantageous or disadvantageous for embryonic survival and can influence hatch rates. Thus, understanding the relationship between poultry practices and production rates is the first step towards successful commercial application. This review aims to assess the influence on hatch rates of injecting different substances in ovo, including effects on embryo and chick health parameters where these are reported. Bibliographic mappings of co-authorship of citations, co-occurrence of keywords, and bibliographic coupling based on the in ovo injection technique and hatchability parameters were also performed. Using the Scopus database, 242 papers were retrieved, reviewed, and submitted for bibliographic mapping using the VOSviewer[&#174;] software. This review provides a broad overview of just over 38 years' research on the subject, revealing that studies have significantly increased and peaked in 2020, being produced primarily by US researchers and published primarily in the journal Poultry Science. It also reveals that despite negative reports relating to some substances in the embryo, in ovo delivery of substances may possibly change the poultry industry for the better in terms of production rates (hatchability) and/or poultry health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104452</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prevalence of Cardiac Lesions in Cases of Bovine Blackleg in Tennessee (USA), 2004-2018.</Title>	<Abstract>Blackleg is a common cause of death in cattle, mostly caused by the bacterium Clostridium chauvoei. Cardiac lesions were traditionally considered uncommon in cases of blackleg in cattle until a 2018 study reported otherwise. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of cardiac disease among cattle that died of blackleg in Tennessee, USA. The outcome of this study would reinforce the importance of assessing cardiac lesions in suspected cases of blackleg in cattle. The University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center database searched for cattle with a confirmed diagnosis of blackleg necropsied between 2004 and 2018. Of the 120 necropsy reports, 37 had a diagnosis of blackleg. Histology slides of skeletal muscle (26/37) and the heart (26/37) were reviewed to confirm the presence of supportive lesions. Of the 37 cases of blackleg identified, 26 animals (70.3%) had cardiac lesions, including 4 (10.8%) that had only cardiac involvement without skeletal muscle lesions. Specifically, (5.4%; 2/37) had only necrotizing myocarditis; (13.5%; 5/37) had only fibrinous or fibrinosuppurative pericarditis, epicarditis, or endocarditis; (51.4%; 19/26) had a combination of myocarditis and pericarditis, epicarditis, or endocarditis; and (29.7%; 11/37) had no lesions. Furthermore, of the 26 cases with cardiac lesions, 24 cases had gross lesions, while 2 cases were identified only by microscopic examination. This indicates that gross examination alone is insufficient to identify cardiac involvement in blackleg cases in cattle. Contrary to traditional perceptions, cardiac lesions in cases of bovine blackleg could be as high as 70% and are most often associated with skeletal muscle lesions. The prevalence of cardiac lesions in cases of blackleg in cattle may be higher when the heart is examined microscopically than if it is only evaluated grossly. Pathologists should specifically evaluate the heart for lesions in suspected cases of blackleg in cattle and utilize microscopic examination when gross lesions are absent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104453</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Peculiarities in the Amino Acid Composition of Sow Colostrum and Milk, and Their Potential Relevance to Piglet Development.</Title>	<Abstract>The composition of mother's milk is considered the ideal diet for neonates. This study investigated how conserved or variable the amino acid profile of sow colostrum and milk is throughout lactation, compared with other studies in sows and other species. Twenty-five sows (parity one to seven) from one farm with gestation lengths of 114 to 116 d were sampled on d 0, 3, and 10 after parturition. The total amino acid profile of the samples was analyzed through ion-exchange chromatography, and the results were displayed as the percentage of total amino acid and compared with literature data. Most of the amino acid concentrations in sow milk decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) throughout the lactation period, while the amino acid profile generally showed a conserved pattern, especially from d 3 to d 10, and was rather similar across different studies. Glutamine + glutamate was the most abundant amino acid in milk at all sampling moments, accounting for 14-17% of total amino acids. The proportions of proline, valine, and glycine in sow milk nearly accounted for 11%, 7%, and 6% respectively, and were higher compared to human, cow, and goat milk, while the methionine proportion was less than the other three. Compared to the large variations often reported in macronutrient concentrations, the amino acid profile of sow milk in the present study, as well as in others, seems well conserved across the lactation period. Similarities with characteristic differences were also observed between sow milk and piglet body composition, which might reflect the nutrition requirements of preweaning piglets. This study warrants further research exploring the link between the whole amino acid profile and the particular amino acids for suckling piglets and could facilitate insight for optimizing creep feed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 245 unsexed one-week-old broiler chicks were divided into seven groups, with seven replications of five chicks each. The treatments were: (1) control, (2) 5% rice bran, (3) 5% rice bran + 0.5 g/kg of Liposorb[&#174;], (4) 5% rice bran + 1 g/kg of vitamin E-Se, (5) 10% rice bran, (6) 10% rice bran + 0.5 g/kg Liposorb[&#174;], and (7) 10% rice bran + 1 g/kg of vitamin E-selenium. Considering the entire experimental period, it did not affect the in vivo performance of the broilers. However, all the experimental diets decreased dressing % compared with the control (p &lt; 0.01) and the worst values were obtained for the 10% RB groups (75.7, 75.9, and 75.8%, respectively, for 10%RB, 10%RB + Liposorb, and 10%RB + Vit. E-Se groups). All the experimental diets decreased (p &lt; 0.01) the albumin/globulin ratio due to an increased level of serum globulins. Differences in lipid profiles, antioxidants, and immunity parameters in plasma were not related to dietary treatments. In conclusion, the use of rice bran up to 10% in diets had no harmful effect on the overall growth performance of the broilers from 1 to 5 weeks of age. Still, carcass characteristics were negatively affected, except for heart percentage. In addition, the supplementation of Liposorb[&#174;] or vitamin E-Se to rice bran diets did not recover these harmful effects. Thus, rice bran could be utilized at 10% in broiler diets when growth performance was considered; further research is required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the complete protein sequence of METTL3 in quail has not been annotated, and its function in skeletal muscle of quails remains unknown. In the current study, the full-length coding sequence of the quail METTL3 was obtained through the 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) and its homology with that of other species was predicted based on a generated phylogenetic tree. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry in a quail myoblast cell line (QM7) demonstrated that METTL3 promotes myoblast proliferation. The overexpression of METTL3 in QM7 cells significantly increased the expression levels of the myoblast differentiation markers myogenin (MYOG), myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1), and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), further demonstrating that METTL3 promotes myoblast differentiation. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing following METTL3 overexpression revealed that METTL3 controls the expression of various genes involved in RNA splicing and the regulation of gene expression, as well as pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that METTL3 plays a vital function in quail myoblast proliferation and differentiation and that the METTL3-mediated RNA m[6]A modification represents an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism in poultry skeletal muscle development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

If high doses of NSAIDs can be safely administered to cattle, this may provide a longer duration of analgesia than using current doses where repeated administration is not practical. Meloxicam was administered to 5 mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows orally at 30 mg/kg, which is 30 times higher than the recommended 1 mg/kg oral dose. Plasma and milk meloxicam concentrations were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by using noncompartmental analysis. The geometric mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 91.06 &#181;g/mL at 19.71 h (Tmax), and the terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was 13.79 h. The geometric mean maximum milk concentration was 33.43 &#181;g/mL at 23.74 h, with a terminal elimination half-life of 12.23 h. A thorough investigation into the potential adverse effects of a meloxicam overdose was performed, with no significant abnormalities reported. The cows were humanely euthanized at 10 d after the treatment, and no gross or histologic lesions were identified. As expected, significantly higher plasma and milk concentrations were attained after the administration of 30 mg/kg meloxicam with similar half-lives to previously published reports. However, no identifiable adverse effects were observed with a drug dose 30 times greater than the industry uses within 10 days of treatment. More research is needed to determine the tissue withdrawal period, safety, and efficacy of meloxicam after a dose of this magnitude in dairy cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Epoprostenol is an intravenous pulmonary vasodilator used to treat PH in humans; however, its efficacy in dogs remains unknown. We investigated the cardiovascular effects of epoprostenol and several cardiac agents for acute heart failure in canine models of chronic PH. Six dogs with chronic PH were anesthetized and underwent right heart catheterization and echocardiography before and after infusion of epoprostenol, dobutamine, dopamine and pimobendane. (The drug administration order was the same for all dogs). High-dose epoprostenol (15-20 ng/kg/min) tended to decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) while significantly decreasing pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and increasing left and right ventricular (LV and RV, respectively) function. Pimobendan significantly increased LV and RV functions without increasing PAP. Conversely, dobutamine and dopamine significantly increased LV and RV function as well as PAP. This study revealed the efficacy of epoprostenol in treating canine PH through its pulmonary and systemic vasodilating effects. Although catecholamines improve LV and RV function, they might worsen PH pathophysiology, and careful monitoring may be necessary when using these drugs. Pimobendan improved LV and RV function without increasing PAP; however, a stronger vasodilating effect was observed with epoprostenol.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37104458</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Can Chemotherapy Negatively Affect the Specific Antibody Response toward Core Vaccines in Canine Cancer Patients?</Title>	<Abstract>The life expectancy of our pets has been getting longer in recent years due to new therapeutic opportunities, better nutrition, and better diagnostic approaches. This positive effect, however, has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in neoplasms, particularly in canine patients. Therefore, veterinarians inevitably face new issues related to these diseases, poorly or never investigated in the past, such as the possible side effects resulting from chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how chemotherapy influences the antibody response against CPV-2, CDV, and CAdV-1 in dogs vaccinated before starting chemotherapy. Twenty-one canine patients with different types of malignancies were sampled before, during, and after different chemotherapy protocols to determine their actual levels of seroprotection against CPV-2, CDV, and CadV-1 by using the in-practice test VacciCheck. Differences related to sex, breed size, type of tumor, and chemotherapy protocol were evaluated. No statistically significant changes in antibody protection emerged for any of the chemotherapy protocol used, suggesting that, contrary to expectation, chemotherapy does not have a marked immunosuppressive effect on the post-vaccine antibody response. These results, although preliminary, may be useful in improving the clinical approach to the canine cancer patient, helping veterinarians fully manage their patients, and enabling owners to feel more confident about their pets' quality of life.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 106 diarrhoeic neonatal piglets were selected. Cultures, MALDI typings, PCRs and evaluation of intestinal lesions were performed. A total of 51 cases (48.1%) were positive for only one pathogen and 54 (50.9%) were positive for more than one pathogen. Clostridium perfringens type A was the most frequently detected pathogen (61.3%), followed by Enterococcus hirae (43.4%), rotavirus type A (38.7%), rotavirus type C (11.3%) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (3.8%). Only lesions in the small intestine were correlated with detected pathogens. The detection of rotavirus was associated with an increased probability of observing villous atrophy (p &lt; 0.001), crypt hyperplasia (p = 0.01) and leucocyte necrosis in the lamina propria (p = 0.05). The detection of Clostridium perfringens type A was associated with an increased probability of observing bacilli in close proximity to the mucosa (p &lt; 0.001) and a decreased probability of observing epithelial necrosis (p = 0.04). Detection of Enterococcus hirae was associated with an increased probability of observing enteroadherent cocci (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate regression logistic models revealed that epithelial necrosis was more likely to occur in Enterococcus hirae-positive piglets (p &lt; 0.02) and neutrophilic infiltrate was more likely to occur in Clostridium perfringens type A- and Enterococcus hirae-positive piglets (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In our study, we used ten adult slaughtered dromedary camels (twenty distal hindlimbs) of different sexes and ages (4-6 years). The hindlimbs were preserved using 10% formalin for about one week. The distal part of the hindlimb of the camels was dissected with extreme precision to show the group of nerves responsible for the nervous supply to the distal part of the hindlimb in dromedary camels. This study shows the numerous branches of the superficial fibular nerve along its extension to the dorsal surface metatarsus and the abaxial aspect of the third digit. The results show that the tibial nerve possesses many branches along its extension to the plantar surface skin of the metatarsus. Additionally, it provides the axial and abaxial plantar surfaces of the fourth digit and the interdigital surfaces as well as its branches to supply the plantar-abaxial and plantar-axial of the third digit. The present study shows the anatomical nerve supply of the hindlimb's distal portion that is essential for anesthesia and surgery in this region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 87,200 ROSS 308 chickens, 1-day old, were housed in two poultry houses (CONTROL, F-LED). In CONTROL, 20,000 females (mean body weight 41.12 &#177; 3 g) and 25,000 males (mean body weight 41.56 &#177; 3 g) were housed, while 19,200 females and 23,000 males of the same genetic make-up and mean body weight were housed in F-LED under the same environmental conditions. In F-LED, to encourage chickens to feed and to redistribute more feed down the feeding line, a feeder equipped with a LED light has been installed at the end of each line. In CONTROL, no light was located on the feeders. At the end of the cycle, the average body weight never showed significant differences both for females (1345 g in CONTROL; 1359 g in F-LED) and for males (2771 g in CONTROL; 2793 g in F-LED). Uniformity improved in F-LED, at 75.2% in females and 54.1% in males, compared to CONTROL, at 65.7% and 48.5%, respectively, for females and males. The feed conversion ratio followed the same trend, being more favorable in chickens reared in F-LED (1.567) compared to those raised in CONTROL (1.608). The application of a single F-LED at the end of each feeding line demonstrated its utility in improving size uniformity and feed conversion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235390</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Identification of Candidate Genes for Min Pig Villi Hair Traits by Genome-Wide Association of Copy Number Variation.</Title>	<Abstract>The Min pig is a famous native pig breed in northeast China, which has the special genetic character of villi hair growth in cold seasons. At present, little research has focused on the genetic mechanism of villi hair growth in Min pigs. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a type of variant that may influence many traits. In this study, we first investigated the phenotype of Large White &#215; Min pigs' F2 pig villi hair in detail and then performed a CNV-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) between CNVs and pig villi hair appearance. Finally, a total number of 15 significant CNVRs were found to be associated with Min pig villi hair. The most significant CNVR was located on chromosome 1. Nearest gene annotation analysis indicated that the pig villi hair traits may be associated with the biological process of the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. QTL overlapping analysis found that among the CNVRs, 14 CNVRs could be co-located with known QTLs. Some genes such as MCHR2, LTBP2, and GFRA2 may be candidate genes for pig villi traits and are worth further study. Our study may provide a basic reference for the selection and breeding of cold-resistant pigs and outdoor breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One strategy to improve P4 concentration is the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thereby inducing the formation of accessory corpus luteum (CL). This study aimed at determining the efficacy of GnRH or hCG treatment regarding embryo transfer (ET) and providing a better clinical veterinary practice guidance. A meta-analysis was conducted on the data from 2048 treated recipient cows and 1546 untreated cows. By inducing the formation of accessory CL with GnRH (100 &#181;g), GnRH analogue Buserelin (8-10 &#181;g), or hCG (&#8805;1500 IU) 5-11 days after synchronized ovulation, hCG alone achieved an improvement (RR = 1.39, p &lt; 0.05), while GnRH and GnRH analogue did not result in significant changes (RR = 1.04, p = 0.26). Treatment with GnRH or hCG 5-7 days after synchronized ovulation was associated with increased chances of pregnancy compared with later treatment (11-14 days). Owing to the treatment, the pregnancy rate of cows with very poor fertility (&lt;40%) was improved, while that of cows with good fertility (&#8805;40%) was not affected. Treatment with GnRH or hCG greatly improved pregnancy rates of parous lactating cows (RR = 1.32, p &lt; 0.05) compared with heifers (RR = 1.02, p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, as indicated by pregnancy loss analysis, the treatment had no benefit on late embryo/early fetus survival at days 28-81. In conclusion, the induction of accessory CL with GnRH or hCG may benefit fertility and have important implications for the management of reproductive performance in the dairy industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235392</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Essential Oils for a Sustainable Control of Honeybee Varroosis.</Title>	<Abstract>The Varroa destructor parasite is the main obstacle to the survival of honey bee colonies. Pest control mainly involves the use of synthetic drugs which, used with the right criteria and in rotation, are able to ensure that infestation levels are kept below the damage threshold. Although these drugs are easy to use and quick to apply, they have numerous disadvantages. Their prolonged use has led to the emergence of pharmacological resistance in treated parasite populations; furthermore, the active ingredients and/or their metabolites accumulate in the beehive products with the possibility of risk for the end consumer. Moreover, the possibility of subacute and chronic toxicity phenomena for adult honeybees and their larval forms must be considered. In this scenario, eco-friendly products derived from plant species have aroused great interest over the years. In recent decades, several studies have been carried out on the acaricidal efficacy of plant essential oils (EOs). Despite the swarming of laboratory and field studies, however, few EO products have come onto the market. Laboratory studies have often yielded different results even for the same plant species. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the various study techniques employed as well as in the variability of the chemical compositions of plants. The purpose of this review is to take stock of the research on the use of EOs to control the V. destructor parasite. It begins with an extensive discussion of the characteristics, properties, and mechanisms of action of EOs, and then examines the laboratory and field tests carried out. Finally, an attempt is made to standardize the results and open up new lines of study in future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The knowledge about the possible hosts of the pathogen is incomplete and is generally only associated with granulomatous lesions in cattle and sheep. The primary organs involved are the mouth, tongue and pharynx. Human infection is extremely rare. Actinobacillus lignieresii is the causative agent of a rare bovine granulomatous disease known as "wooden tongue". In this research, we describe a case of cerebral and ocular metastatic diffusion of granuloma due to infection with Actinobacillus lignieresii in cattle, probably resulting from primary oral localization. Diagnosis was made using histopathological assay which made it possible to highlight the typical lesion of actinobacillosis, and bacteriological assay that allowed to isolate the pathogen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the prevalence of GyH1 infection in chickens and wild birds remains unknown. Here, we developed a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) to investigate GyH1 infection in 8 chicken species and 25 wild bird species. A total of 2258 serum samples from chickens (n = 2192) in 15 provinces, and wild birds (n = 66) in Jinan Wildlife Hospital were collected from 2017 to 2021 in China. The GyH1-positive rates in chickens and wild birds were 9.3% (203/2192) and 22.7% (15/66), respectively. GyH1 was present in all flocks in 15 provinces. From 2017 to 2021, the positive rate ranged from 7.93% (18/227) to 10.67% (56/525), and the highest positive rate was present in 2019. Upon chicken age, the highest positive rate (25.5%) was present in young chickens (14-35 days old). Moreover, the GyH1-positive rate in broiler breeders (12.6%, 21/167) was significantly higher than that in layer chickens (8.9%, 14/157). This study shows that GyH1 has spread in chicken flocks and wild birds, and the higher GyH1-positive rate in wild birds indicates the risk of spillover from wild birds to chickens. Our study expanded the GyH1 epidemiological aspects and provided a theoretical basis for GyH1 prevention.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Poultry are vaccinated against Salmonella Enteritidis in many countries, despite the absence of clinical symptoms, using commercially available live-attenuated vaccines. We previously constructed a highly attenuated temperature-sensitive (ts) Salmonella Enteritidis mutant, 2S-G10. In the present study, we describe the construction and attenuation-associated characteristics of 2S-G10. We infected 1-day-old chicks with 2S-G10 and the parental strains to evaluate the attenuation. One week after infection, 2S-G10 was not detected in the liver, cecum, or cecal tonsil tissues of the orally inoculated chicks, contrary to the parental strain. This indicates that 2S-G10 was highly attenuated when compared to the parental stain. In vitro experiments revealed the inability of 2S-G10 to grow at the normal body temperature of chickens and invade chicken liver epithelial cells. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis between the complete genome sequence of 2S-G10 and its parental strain revealed SNPs in bcsE, recG, rfaF, and pepD_1 genes, which are involved in epithelial cell invasion and persistence in host systems, growth, lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, and cellular survival under heat stress, respectively. These potential characteristics are consistent with the findings of in vitro experiments. Conclusively, chemical treatment-induced random genetic mutations highly attenuated 2S-G10, implying its potential to be developed as a novel live-attenuated vaccine against Salmonella Enteritidis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clinical and laboratory examination, echocardiography, blood culture, and pathohistology revealed evidence of infective endocarditis, ischemic renal infarcts, and septic encephalitis. Treatment was started immediately but the dog's condition worsened, and the dog had to be euthanized. The causative Streptococcus canis strain was detected by blood culture and MALDI-TOF MS and analyzed using whole-genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing did not detect any resistance. The affected heart valve was analyzed using FISH imaging, which showed a streptococcal biofilm on the heart valve. Bacteria in biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. Early diagnosis could be beneficial to treatment outcome. Treatment of endocarditis could be improved by researching the optimal dosage of antibiotics in conjunction with the use of biofilm-active drugs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

According to gross and microscopic examination, livers were subsequently classified into three groups: normal liver (Group A), liver with the presence of fertile hydatid cysts (Group B), and liver with the presence of sterile hydatid cysts (Group C). Immunohistochemical analyses were accomplished using primary antibodies anti-Iba1, anti-CD3, anti-CD20, anti-TGF-&#946;, and anti-MMP9. Finally, real-time PCR was performed in order to estimate the concentration levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interferon-&#947; (INF-&#947;), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10, and TGF-&#946;. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a diffuse immunolabelling of mononuclear cells for Iba-1 and TGF-&#946; and a higher amount of CD20+ B cells compared to CD3+ T cells in both Groups B and C. The expression levels of Th-1-like immune cytokines TNF-&#945;, INF-&#947;, and IL-12 did not show significant statistical differences. However, we found a significant increase in expression levels of Th-2 immune cytokines TGF-&#946; and IL-10 in Groups B and C compared to Group A. Taken together, our findings suggest that macrophages have a predominant role in the local immune response to cystic echinococcosis. Moreover, we can speculate that Th2 immunity may be dominant, corroborating the idea that B cells are decisively essential in the control of the immune response during parasitic infection and that the immunomodulatory role of IL-10 and TGF-&#946; may ensure the persistence of the parasite within the host.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This genetic divergence can influence the clinical response of the animals. We aimed to describe clinical and hematological changes in 125 dogs that reacted to BrTRP36, USTRP36, and CRTRP36 genotypes through enzyme immunoassays and to highlight the current concern regarding infection by the Costa Rican genotype. The results showed that 52.0% reacted to the Brazilian genotype, 22.4% reacted to the Costa Rican genotype, and 16.0% reacted to the American genotype, and some co-reactions were observed. Dogs reactive to BrTRP36 were 1.24% more likely to present with medullary regeneration in cases of anemia and 3% less likely to manifest hyperproteinemia, while dogs reactive to CRTRP36 were 0.7% less likely to present with medullary regeneration. Febrile illness and neurological alterations were also statistically associated, with an 85.7% and 231.2% increased likelihood, respectively, to occur in dogs that reacted to USTRP36. The dogs with the American genotype developed clinical manifestations related to systemic inflammation, while those with the Brazilian genotype of E. canis were more dispersed in the region studied, showing greater adaptation to the hosts. We highlight the significant serocurrence of the Costa Rican genotype, which has already been described to have zoonotic potential and which showed less adaptation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite euthanasia guidelines, little is known about euthanasia techniques used in practice. We administered an online survey of Australian veterinarians who had euthanised at least one dog in the previous 12 months. We found that 668 (96.8%) had euthanised a dog in the previous 12 months, almost all using intravenous pentobarbitone sodium (n = 651, 99.7%). For non-emergency euthanasia (n = 653), the majority (n = 442, 67.7%) administered a premedication or sedation prior to euthanasia versus less than half for emergency euthanasia (n = 286, 46.4%). Practices and views about euthanasia varied. Female veterinarians and veterinarians located in metropolitan regions were more likely to administer a premedication or sedation prior to non-emergency euthanasia (p &lt; 0.05). Veterinarians in private mixed animal practices were less likely to administer a premedication or sedation prior to a non-emergency euthanasia (p &lt; 0.05). For non-emergency and emergency euthanasia, veterinarians who worked in "other" practice types were more likely to administer a premedication or sedation than private companion animal practices (p &lt; 0.05). The possible reasons for differences in euthanasia practices are explored, and scope for refinement is identified.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tapeworms from the Genus Echinococcus are particularly important as they can cause cystic or alveolar echinococcosis. A molecular screening was performed on 279 fecal samples collected from carcasses of wild carnivores from Central Italy using PCR targeting diagnostic fragments of nad1, rrnS, and nad5 genes. Samples positive for either Taenia spp. or Echinococcus granulosus were sequenced to taxonomically identify the parasitic DNA. Of the 279 samples, 134 (48.0%) gave positive results in the multiplex PCR. Only one (0.4%) sample from an Apennine wolf tested positive for Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (genotype G3), whereas no sample tested positive for E. multilocularis. The most frequently detected tapeworms were: Mesocestoides corti (syn M. vogae) (12.9%), M. litteratus (10.8%), Taenia serialis (9.3%), and T. hydatigena (6.5%), other tapeworms were rarely detected. The results suggest that Echinococcus infections in Central Italy do not seem to be sustained by sylvatic cycles, confirming the absence of E. multilocularis in Central Italy. The survey corroborates, yet again, the importance of passive surveillance of wild animals that can serve as reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens, especially on wild canids that in other areas are strongly implicated in the transmission of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A lot of researchers have been applying these methods to image analysis diagnosis, developing software capable of assisting veterinary doctors or radiologists in their daily practice. This article details the main methodologies used to develop software applications on machine learning and how veterinarians with an interest in this field can benefit from such methodologies. The main goal of this study is to offer veterinary professionals a simple guide to enable them to understand the basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the concepts such as deep learning, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and the performance evaluation method. The language is adapted for medical technicians, and the work already published in this field is reviewed for application in the imaging diagnosis of different animal body systems: musculoskeletal, thoracic, nervous, and abdominal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235404</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Tobacco Smoke Exposure in Pregnant Dogs: Maternal and Newborn Cotinine Levels: A Pilot Study.</Title>	<Abstract>Active and passive smoking in pregnant women is associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality risk, including abortion, preterm birth, low birthweight, and malformations. No data are available on intrauterine exposure to smoking during pregnancy in dogs. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the detectability and quantity of cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, in maternal (serum and hair) and newborn (amniotic fluid and hair) biospecimens collected at birth in dogs. For this purpose, twelve pregnant bitches, six exposed to the owner's smoke and six unexposed, were enrolled. A further six non-pregnant bitches exposed to passive smoke were included to investigate the role of pregnancy status on cotinine uptake. Exposed dogs, dams, and puppies had greater cotinine concentrations than unexposed ones. Although without statistical significance, serum and hair cotinine concentrations were higher in pregnant compared to non-pregnant bitches, suggesting a different sensitivity to tobacco smoke exposure during gestation. The present results provide evidence for cotinine transplacental passage in the dog. It is conceivable that fragile patients such as pregnant, lactating, and neonate dogs may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke exposure. Owners should be sensitized to the risk of smoke exposure for their pets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235405</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Technical Validation of Ultrasound Assessment of the Thyroid Gland in Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Little is known about thyroid diseases in ruminants, probably due to the lack of diagnosis techniques developed in this species. However, thyroid ultrasound (TU) is widely used in human and in companion animal's medicine. It is a cheap and non-invasive examination, which allows for the identification of thyroid structures or diffuse diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of TU in five calves and five cows through inter- and intra-observer repeatability. The size of the thyroid gland was measured from three views: left sagittal, right sagittal and transverse; nine measurements per view. The intra-observer coefficient was calculated for each observer. For the inter-observer, the first observer was a board-certified imagist (European College of Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging diplomate), the second was a board-certified specialist in bovine and herd management (European College of Bovine Health Managementdiplomate) and the third was an in-trained veterinarian for the TU. They each scanned the thyroid gland successively, following the same method. The intra-observer variabilities for observers 1, 2 and 3 were 8.22%, 5.53%, 5.38%, and 7.18%, 8.65% and 6.36%, respectively, for calves and cows. The inter-observer variability for calves was 10.4% and for cows, 11.8%. This study confirms the feasibility of repeatable intra- and inter-observer TU-estimated measurements in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235406</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>A Systematic Review of Hepatitis E Virus Detection in Camels.</Title>	<Abstract>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) represents a major cause of acute hepatitis and is considered an emerging public health problem around the world. In the Middle East's and Africa's arid regions, where camels frequently interact with human populations and camel-derived food products are a component of the food chain, camel-borne zoonotic HEV infection is a potential threat. To date, no review paper has been published on HEV in camels. As such, the purpose of the current work is to provide a scientific review of the identification of HEV genotypes seven and eight in camels worldwide to have a better understanding of the current status of this topic and to identify gaps in the current knowledge. Searches were carried out in the electronic databases PubMed, Mendeley, Web of Science, and Scopus, including studies published until 31 December 2022 (n = 435). Once the databases were checked for duplicate papers (n = 307), the exclusion criteria were applied to remove any research that was not relevant (n = 118). As a result, only 10 papers were found to be eligible for the study. Additionally, in eight of the ten studies, the rates of HEV infection were found to be between 0.6% and 2.2% in both stool and serum samples. Furthermore, four studies detected HEV genotype seven in dromedary camels, and two studies have shown HEV genotype eight in Bactrian camels. Interestingly, these genotypes were recently reported in camels from the Middle East and China, where one human infection with HEV genotype seven has been associated with the consumption of contaminated camel meat and milk. In conclusion, more research will be needed to determine the prevalence of HEV infection in camels around the world as well as the risk of foodborne transmission of contaminated camel products. As camels are utility animals in several countries, HEV in these animals may pose a potential risk to public health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Effusion management can be performed with multiple pleurocenteses or the application of chest drains. New modified vascular devices have been used for patients with chronic diseases; they offer the advantage of allowing home management and do not require hospitalization. Eight PleuralPort[TM] devices were applied in seven dogs during thoracoscopic exploration and biopsy procedures; five were affected by mesothelioma; one by lung metastases from a mammary carcinoma; and one by chronic chylothorax. The median time of surgical procedure was 51 min; one developed pneumothorax post-operatively that resolved within 12 h after repeated drainage; one device was obstructed after 45 days and was successfully managed by flushing. All patients were discharged after 24 h. The median duration of port insertion in cancer patients was 5 months and those dogs were euthanized because of tumor progression; in the dog with chylothorax, the device was removed after 1 year when the effusion had resolved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235408</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic Variability and Recombination of the NSP2 Gene of PRRSV-2 Strains in China from 1996 to 2021.</Title>	<Abstract>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most serious infectious diseases that detrimentally affects the pig industry worldwide. The disease, which is typically difficult to control, is an immunosuppressive disease caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the genome of which (notably the NSP2 gene) undergoes rapid mutation. In this study, we sought to determine the genetic variation in the PRRSV-2 NSP2 gene in China from 1996 to 2021. Strain information was obtained from the GenBank database and analyzed from a molecular epidemiological perspective. We compared the nucleotide and amino acid homologies of the NSP2 sequences of different PRRSV-2 lineages, and examined phylogenetic relationships based on an analysis of the NSP2 sequences of 122 strains. The results revealed that NADC-30-like strains, which are represented by lineage 1, and HP-PRRSV strains, which are represented by lineage 8, were the most prevalent in China from 1996 to 2021. Close similarities were detected in the genetic evolution of lineages 3, 5, and 8. For nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, we selected representative strains from each lineage, and for the NSP2 among different PRRSV-2 strains, we accordingly detected homologies of 72.5-99.8% and 63.9-99.4% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, thereby indicating certain differences in the degrees of NSP2 amino acid and nucleotide variation. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, we identified deletions, insertions, and substitutions at multiple sites among the NSP2 sequences of PRRSV-2 strains. Recombination analysis revealed the occurrence of five recombinant events among the 135 selected PRRSV-2 strains, and that there is a high probability of recombination of lineage 1 strains. The findings of this study enabled us to gain an in-depth understanding of the prevalence of PRRSV in China over the past 25 years and will contribute to providing a theoretical basis for evolution and epidemiology of the spread of PRRSV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from nasal swabs samples taken from a one-year-old male Serra da Estrela dog with rhinorrhea that was treated with amikacin. An extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in the first sample taken from the left nasal cavity of the dog. Seven days later, methicillin-resistant (MRSP) Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was also isolated. Nevertheless, no alterations to the therapeutic protocol were performed. Once the inhibitory action of the antibiotic disappeared, the competitive advantage of the amikacin-resistant MRSP was lost, and only commensal flora was observed on both nasal cavities. The genotypic profile of extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed the same characteristics and close relation to other strains, mainly from Estonia, Slovakia and Romania. Regarding MRSP isolates, although resistance to aminoglycosides was present in the first MRSP, the second isolate carried aac(6')-aph(2&#8243;), which enhanced its resistance to amikacin. However, the veterinary action was focused on the treatment of the primary agent (ESBL K. pneumoniae), and the antibiotic applied was according to its phenotypic profile, which may have led to the resolution of the infectious process. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of targeted therapy, proper clinical practice and laboratory-hospital communication to safeguard animal, human and environmental health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235410</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Proposing Clinicopathological Staging and Mitotic Count as Prognostic Factors for Canine Soft Tissue Sarcomas.</Title>	<Abstract>Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of malignant mesenchymal tumors with similar histological features and biological behaviors. They are characterized by a low to moderate local recurrence rate and low metastasis, affecting approximately 20% of patients. Although this tumor set is vital in veterinary medicine, no previous unified staging system or mitotic count has been associated with patient prognosis. Therefore, this study proposed a new clinicopathological staging method and evaluated a cut-off value for mitosis related to the survival of dogs affected by STS. This study included 105 dogs affected by STS, treated only with surgery, and a complete follow-up evaluation. The new clinicopathological staging system evaluated tumor size (T), nodal involvement (N), distant metastasis (M), and histological grading criteria (G) to categorize the tumor stage into four groups (stages I, II, III, and IV). The proposed tumor staging system was able to differentiate patients' prognoses, with dogs with stage IV disease experiencing the lowest survival time and dogs with stage I disease having the highest survival time (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, we assessed the median mitosis (based on mitotic count) and its association with overall survival. Our study's median mitosis was 5, and patients with &#8804;5 mitoses had a higher survival time (p = 0.006). Overall, the proposed staging system and mitotic count seemed promising in the prediction of patient prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The limited effect of antibiotics on antibiotic-resistant E. coli makes this bacterium a potential threat to human health. Yujin powder (YJP) has been reported as an agent that releases the symptoms caused by E. coli for a long time. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Yujin powder (YJP) and its components, Scutellariae Radix (SR) and Baicalin (Bac), anti-against multi-drug-resistant E. coli in vitro and in vivo. A multi-drug-resistant bacteria was isolated and identified from a clinical diarrheal chick. Then, the anti-bacterial effects of drugs were assessed in vitro and in vivo by analyzing the bacteria loads of organs, the levels of endotoxin, TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 of the serum. Results found that the pathogenic E. coli was resistant to 19 tested antibiotics. YJP, SR, and Bac could directly inhibit the growth of this strain at high concentrations in vitro, and presents obvious anti-bacterial effects by reducing the bacterial loads, the release of endotoxin, and inflammation in vivo, which was much more effective than the resistant antibiotic ciprofloxacin. This study demonstrates that those natural medicines have the potential to be used as novel treatments to treat the disease caused by this isolated MDREC strain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to evaluate the immediate/delayed pruritus responses and the pruritic behaviors observed in an intradermal IL-31-induced pruritic model of healthy dogs and the anti-pruritic effect of oclacitinib on said model. In Phase 1, all the dogs were randomized and video-recorded for 300 min after intradermal canine recombinant IL-31 injections (1.75 &#181;g/kg) and vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) injections. In Phase 2, all the dogs received oral oclacitinib (0.4-0.6 mg/kg, twice daily for 4 consecutive days and once daily on day 5), with the intradermal IL-31 injection performed on day 5. Two blinded investigators reviewed the pruritic behaviors in all the video recordings. Intradermal IL-31 administration to healthy dogs caused a significant increase in the total (p = 0.0052) and local (p = 0.0003) seconds of pruritic behavior compared to the vehicle control. Oral oclacitinib administration significantly reduced the total (p = 0.0011) and local (p = 0.0156) intradermal IL-31-induced pruritic seconds; there was no significant difference in pruritic seconds between the vehicle and oclacitinib within the IL-31 groups. Significant delayed pruritic responses at 150-300 min after IL-31 injections were observed, and intradermal IL-31 failed to induce acute itch (first 30 min). Intradermal injection of IL-31 induces delayed itch responses in dogs that are diminished by the effect of oclacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235413</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Development of a Crystal Digital RT-PCR for the Detection of Atypical Porcine Pestivirus.</Title>	<Abstract>Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), a newly discovered virus, is associated with the type A-II congenital tremor (CT) in neonatal piglets. APPV distributes throughout the world and causes certain economic losses to the swine industry. The specific primers and probe were designed targeting the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of APPV to amplify a 90 bp fragment, and the recombinant standard plasmid was constructed. After optimizing the concentrations of primers and probe, annealing temperature, and reaction cycles, a crystal digital RT-PCR (cdRT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were successfully established. The results showed that the standard curves of the qRT-PCR and the cdRT-PCR had R[2] values of 0.999 and 0.9998, respectively. Both methods could specifically detect APPV, and no amplification signal was obtained from other swine viruses. The limit of detection (LOD) of the cdRT-PCR was 0.1 copies/&#181;L, and that of the qRT-PCR was 10 copies/&#181;L. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of repeatability and reproducibility were less than 0.90% for the qRT-PCR and less than 5.27% for the cdRT-PCR. The 60 clinical tissue samples were analyzed using both methods, and the positivity rates of APPV were 23.33% by the qRT-PCR and 25% by the cdRT-PCR, with a coincidence rate of 98.33%. The results indicated that the cdRT-PCR and the qRT-PCR developed here are highly specific, sensitive methods for the rapid and accurate detection of APPV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we investigated the uterine microbiome in bitches (n = 5) and queens (n = 3) undergoing elective cesarean section in two facilities. Samples included swabs from the endometrium, amniotic fluid, and meconium, and environmental swabs of the surgical tray as controls. Culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate the presence of bacteria. Culture was positive for 34.3% of samples (uterus n = 3, amniotic fluid n = 2, meconium n = 4, controls n = 0), mostly with low growth of common contaminant bacteria. With sequencing techniques, the bacterial abundance was significantly lower than in environmental controls (p &lt; 0.05). Sequencing results showed a species-specific pattern, and significant differences between canine and feline bacterial populations were found at order, family, and genus level. No differences were found in alpha and beta diversities between feto-maternal tissues and controls (p &gt; 0.05). Dominant phyla were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria in different proportions based on tissue and species. Culture and sequencing results suggest that the bacterial biomass is very low in healthy canine and feline pregnancies at term, that bacteria likely originate from contamination from the dam's skin, and that the presence of viable bacteria could not be confirmed most of the time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infectious and parasitic diseases may contribute to reducing the number of sea turtles. Bacteria are widespread in marine environments and, depending on the species, may act as primary or opportunistic pathogens. Most of them are able to infect other animal species, including humans, in which they can cause mild or severe diseases. Therefore, direct or indirect contact of humans with sea turtles, their products, and environment where they live represent a One Health threat. Chlamydiae, Mycobacteria, and Salmonellae are known zoonotic agents able to cause mild or severe diseases in sea turtles, other animals, and humans. However, other bacteria that are potentially zoonotic, including those that are antimicrobially resistant, are involved in different pathologies of marine turtles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235417</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prevalence and Haplotypes of Toxoplasma gondii in Native Village Chickens and Pigs in Peninsular Malaysia.</Title>	<Abstract>Toxoplasma gondii is an important zoonotic foodborne parasite capable of infecting almost all warm-blooded animal species worldwide. Toxoplasmosis is usually acquired via ingestion of undercooked infected animal tissues resulting in life-threatening consequences for unborn foetus and immunocompromised individuals. A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection, its associated risk factors in farms, and haplotypes isolated from the native village chicken and pig populations in Peninsular Malaysia. The seroprevalence of T. gondii in village chickens at the animal level was low at 7.6% (95% CI: 4.60-11.60), while at the farm level, it was 52.0% (95% CI: 31.30-72.20). For pigs, the animal-level seroprevalence of T. gondii was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.60-5.10), while the farm-level, it was 31.6% (95% CI: 12.60-56.60). The PCR-based DNA detection on meat samples from chickens (n = 250) and pork (n = 121) detected 14.0% (95% CI: 9.95-18.9) and 5.8% (95% CI: 2.4-11.6) positive, respectively. Six unique T. gondii haplotypes were isolated from the tissue samples. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that feeding the chickens farm-produced feeds and allowing wild animals access to pig farms were significant determinants for farm-level seropositivity. Providing hygienic and good quality feeds to chickens and increasing biosecurity in pig farms through prevention of access by wildlife may reduce the risk of transmission of T. gondii infection in the local chickens and pig farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The micronised purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) is a biocompatible active polyphenolic compound derived from flavonoid glycosides which exhibits several antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and phlebotonic properties. The goal was to assess the effects of an alternative therapy for mastitis based on MPFF intramammary infusions in late lactation in dairy cows naturally infected by Staphylococcus spp. The California Mastitis Test (CMT scores) was performed to detect mastitis-positive quarters in twelve dairy farms. All cows were screened for immune response by measuring somatic cell counts (SCCs; cells/mL) in milk samples from each quarter. In addition, bacteriological identification, pathogenic bacterial isolates, and total bacterial counts (TBCs; CFU/mL) were assessed before (day 0, last milking day) and after (day 3 post-calving) MPFF application. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the pathogenic isolated bacteria were evaluated. Finally, cure rates (%) were determined for each MPFF treatment. Around 15 mastitis-related genera were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus (25.2%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS; 22.4%) were the most prevalent pathogens. No statistical differences were observed in SCCs and TBCs after low, medium, and high MPFF dose administration in S. aureus-positive mastitis cases (p &gt; 0.05). However, differences were observed in SCCs and TBCs after medium and high MPFF dose administration in CNS-positive quarters (p &lt; 0.05). The pathogenic bacteria isolate reduction after MPFF applications showed a dose-response fashion (p &lt; 0.01) while isolates obtained from controls and low MPFF-treated quarters remained similar, irrespective of the pathogen (p &gt; 0.05). Sensitivity patterns were variable, although S. aureus remained resistant, irrespective of the MPFF dose. However, CNS showed a dose-response sensitivity pattern. Finally, the cure rate (%) on day 3 post-partum improved significantly using medium and higher MPFF doses in CNS-positive quarters (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, MPFF treatment was found to be more effective for CNS-positive cases in the late lactation due to noticeable dose-specific responses regarding somatic cells, bacterial counts, sensitivity patterns, and cure rates in dairy cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235419</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Potential Promises and Perils of Human Biological Treatments for Immunotherapy in Veterinary Oncology.</Title>	<Abstract>The emergence of immunotherapy for the treatment of human cancers has heralded a new era in oncology, one that is making its way into the veterinary clinic. As the immune system of many animal species commonly seen by veterinarians is similar to humans, there is great hope for the translation of human therapies into veterinary oncology. The simplest approach for veterinarians would be to adopt existing reagents that have been developed for human medicine, due to the potential of reduced cost and the time it takes to develop a new drug. However, this strategy may not always prove to be effective and safe with regard to certain drug platforms. Here, we review current therapeutic strategies that could exploit human reagents in veterinary medicine and also those therapies which may prove detrimental when human-specific biological molecules are used in veterinary oncology. In keeping with a One Health framework, we also discuss the potential use of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from camelid species (also known as Nanobodies&#8482;) for therapies targeting multiple veterinary animal patients without the need for species-specific reformulation. Such reagents would not only benefit the health of our veterinary species but could also guide human medicine by studying the effects of outbred animals that develop spontaneous tumors, a more relevant model of human diseases compared to traditional laboratory rodent models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this review is to investigate the presence and the characteristics of Fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from canine or feline samples, estimate the possible causes of the dissemination of associated strains in pets, and underline the requirements of prospective relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search of current literature in two databases. A total of 33 articles were finally included in the review. Relevant data were tracked down, assembled, and compared. Referring to the geographical distribution, Northeast Asia was the main area of origin of the studies. E. coli was the predominant species detected, followed by other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, and Pseudomonas spp. FosA and fosA3 were the more frequently encountered Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the related Gram-negative isolates, while fosB was regularly encountered in Gram-positive ones. The majority of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and co-carried resistance genes against several classes of antibiotics and especially &#946;-Lactams, such as blaCTX-M and mecA. These results demonstrate the fact that the cause of the spreading of Fosfomycin-resistant bacteria among pets could be the extended use of other antibacterial agents, that promote the prevalence of MDR, epidemic strains among an animal population. Through the circulation of these strains into a community, a public health issue could arise. Further research is essential though, for the comprehensive consideration of the issue, as the current data are limited.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main factor that affects the production cost and environmental protection cost of the pig industry is the feed efficiency of pigs. This study aimed to detect the differentially expressed proteins in the early blood index determination serum between high-feed efficiency and low-feed efficiency pigs and to provide a basis for further identification of biomarkers using the isobaric tandem mass tag and parallel reaction monitoring approach. In total, 350 (age, 90 &#177; 2 d; body weight, 41.20 &#177; 4.60 kg) purebred Yorkshire pigs were included in the study, and their serum samples were obtained during the early blood index determination. The pigs were then arranged based on their feed efficiency; 24 pigs with extreme phenotypes were grouped as high-feed efficiency and low-feed efficiency, with 12 pigs in each group. A total of 1364 proteins were found in the serum, and 137 of them showed differential expression between the groups with high- and low-feed efficiency, with 44 of them being upregulated and 93 being downregulated. PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) was used to verify 10 randomly chosen differentially expressed proteins. The proteins that were differentially expressed were shown to be involved in nine pathways, including the immune system, digestive system, human diseases, metabolism, cellular processing, and genetic information processing, according to the KEGG and GO analyses. Moreover, all of the proteins enriched in the immune system were downregulated in the high-feed efficiency pigs, suggesting that a higher immune level may not be conducive to improving feed efficiency in pigs. This study provides insights into the important feed efficiency proteins and pathways in pigs, promoting the further development of protein biomarkers for predicting and improving porcine feed efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There are very few reports and studies that have been carried out to understand the prevalence, distribution, and epidemiological profile of Anaplasma spp. infection in dogs in Hainan province/island. In the present study, we have tried to understand the prevalence, distribution, and occurrence of Anaplasma spp. infections in dogs (n = 1051) in Hainan Island/Province to establish a surveillance-based study. The confirmed positive samples by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were subjected to capillary sequencing for further strain-specific confirmation, followed by the construction of phylogenetic trees to determine their genetic relations. Various statistical tools were used to analyze related risk factors. There were three species of Anaplasma detected from the Hainan region; namely, A. phagocytophilum, A. bovis, and A. platys. The overall prevalence of Anaplasma is 9.7% (102/1051). A. phagocytopihum was prevalent in 1.0% of dogs (11/1051), A. bovis was found in 2.7% of dogs (28/1051), and A. platys in 6.0% of dogs (63/1051). Our surveillance-based study conducted to understand the occurrence and distribution pattern of Anaplasma spp. in Hainan will help in designing effective control measures along with management strategies so as to treat and control the infection in the area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, human intervention is still needed in cases such as system failure, the bad or unpredicted behavior of the animals, or even in cases of danger, the welfare of the animal. This study documents the enhancement of an alarm generation system, initially developed within the scope of the SheepIT project, to monitor animal behavior and equipment, which warns the human operator of the occurrence of undesirable events that require intervention. Special attention was given to the use of case scenarios in places without Internet access, such as rural areas. Therefore, the system was integrated with a satellite interface, as a way of guaranteeing the timely delivery of the alarm messages. To ensure an acceptable operating cost, the system was further optimized in terms of message encoding, considering the cost of this type of communication. This study assessed the overall performance of the system, evaluated its scalability, and compared the efficiency gains from the optimization, as well as the performance of the satellite link.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235424</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Transcriptome Profile Analysis Identifies Candidate Genes for the Melanin Pigmentation of Skin in Tengchong Snow Chickens.</Title>	<Abstract>Tengchong Snow chickens are one of the most precious, black-boned chickens in Yunnan province and usually produce black meat. However, we found a small number of white meat traits in the chicken population during feeding. In order to determine the pattern of melanin deposition and the molecular mechanism of formation in the Tengchong Snow chicken, we measured the luminance value (L value) and melanin content in the skin of black meat chickens (Bc) and white meat chickens (Wc) using a color colorimeter, ELISA kit, and enzyme marker. The results showed that the L value of skin tissues in black meat chickens was significantly lower than that of white meat chickens, and the L value of skin tissues gradually increased with an increase in age. The melanin content of skin tissues in black meat chickens was higher than that of white meat chickens, and melanin content in the skin tissues gradually decreased with an increase in age, but this difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05); the L value of skin tissues in black meat chickens was negatively correlated with melanin content, and the correlation coefficient was mostly above -0.6. In addition, based on the phenotypic results, we chose to perform the comparative transcriptome profiling of skin tissues at 90 days of age. We screened a total of 44 differential genes, of which 32 were upregulated and 12 were downregulated. These DEGs were mainly involved in melanogenesis, tyrosine metabolism and RNA transport. We identified TYR, DCT, and EDNRB2 as possible master effector genes for skin pigmentation in Tengchong Snow black meat chickens through DEGs analysis. Finally, we measured the mRNA of TYR, DCT, MC1R, EDNRB2, GPR143, MITF, and TYRP1 genes through a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and found that the mRNA of all the above seven genes decreased with increasing age. In conclusion, our study initially constructed an evaluation system for the black-boned traits of Tengchong Snow chickens and found key candidate genes regulating melanin deposition, which could provide an important theoretical basis for the selection and breeding of black-boned chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235425</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Review of Canine Lymphoma Treated with Chemotherapy-Outcomes and Prognostic Factors.</Title>	<Abstract>While canine lymphoma is a relatively common and important disease seen by veterinarians, there are limited comprehensive reviews of the literature regarding the remission and survival times following chemotherapy, and the associated prognostic factors. This comprehensive thematic review covers the available veterinary literature covering treatment outcomes and identified prognostic factors. A lack of standardised approaches to evaluate and report the outcomes was identified, including factors that would alter the duration of responses by weeks, or occasionally months. After publication of the suggested reporting criteria, this has improved but is still not uniformly applied. The prognostic factors included for evaluation varied from as few as three to seventeen, with over 50 studies using only univariate analysis. Individual papers reported much longer outcomes than others, but assessing the outcomes overall, there has been minimal change over the last 40 years. This supports the belief that novel approaches for lymphoma therapy will be required to substantively improve outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Treatment of this bacterium is challenging because some strains have developed multi-drug resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance patterns and biofilm production of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained from dogs. The study found that resistance to various &#946;-lactam antimicrobials was widespread, with cefovecin and ceftiofur showing resistance in 74% and 59% of the isolates tested, respectively. Among the aminoglycosides, all strains showed susceptibility to amikacin and tobramycin, while gentamicin resistance was observed in 7% of the tested isolates. Furthermore, all isolates carried the oprD gene, which is essential in governing the entry of antibiotics into bacterial cells. The study also investigated the presence of virulence genes and found that all isolates carried exoS, exoA, exoT, exoY, aprA, algD, and plcH genes. This study compared P. aeruginosa resistance patterns worldwide, emphasizing regional understanding and responsible antibiotic use to prevent multi-drug resistance from emerging. In general, the results of this study emphasize the importance of the continued monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In particular, only two cases of fatal disseminated listeriosis have been described in the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). In this study, we describe a lethal case of L. monocytogenes infection in a loggerhead sea turtle. The turtle was found alive, stranded on a beach in North-eastern Italy, but perished soon after being rescued. The autoptic examination revealed that heart, lung, liver, spleen, and urinary bladder were disseminated with multiple, firm, 0.1-0.5 mm sized, nodular, white-green lesions. Microscopically, these lesions corresponded with heterophilic granulomas with Gram+ bacteria within the necrotic center. Furthermore, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative for acid-fast organisms. Colonies isolated from heart and liver were tested through MALDI-TOF for species identification, revealing the presence of L. monocytogenes. Whole Genome Sequencing on L. monocytogenes isolates was performed and the subsequent in silico genotyping revealed the belonging to Sequence Type 6 (ST 6); the virulence profile was evaluated, showing the presence of pathogenicity islands commonly observed in ST 6. Our results further confirm that L. monocytogenes should be posed in differential diagnosis in case of nodular lesions of loggerhead sea turtles; thus, given the zoonotic potential of the microorganism, animals should be treated with particular caution. In addition, wildlife animals can play an active role as carriers of possibly pathogenetic and virulent strains and contribute to the distribution of L. monocytogenes in the environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This compound showed the ability to modulate canine immune response in our previous study; but its effect on the peripheral blood transcriptome and serum metabolome was unknown. This study aims to reveal the potential mechanism behind the immunomodulatory function of CPP-Se. We have identified 341 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CPP-Se groups as compared to the control group which comprised 110 up-regulated and 231 down-regulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis found that DEGs were mainly involved in immune-related signaling pathways. Moreover, the immune-related DEGs and hub genes were identified. Similarly, metabolomics identified 53 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in the CPP-Se group, of which 17 were up-regulated and 36 were down-regulated. The pathways mainly enriched by DEMs were primary bile acid biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, and other amino acids metabolic pathways. Combined analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data showed that the DEGs and DEMs were commonly enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolic pathways. Taken together, our findings provided a theoretical basis for further understanding of the immunomodulatory function of CPP-Se as well as a scientific reference for the future use of CPP-Se in pet foods as a dietary supplement to modulate the immunity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235429</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Congenital Portosystemic Shunts in Dogs and Cats: Treatment, Complications and Prognosis.</Title>	<Abstract>Congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are a common vascular anomaly of the liver in dogs and cats. Clinical signs of CPSS are non-specific and may wax and wane, while laboratory findings can raise the clinical suspicion for CPSS, but they are also not specific. Definitive diagnosis will be established by evaluation of liver function tests and diagnostic imaging. The aim of this article is to review the management, both medical and surgical, complications, and prognosis of CPSS in dogs and cats. Attenuation of the CPSS is the treatment of choice and may be performed by open surgical intervention using ameroid ring constrictors, thin film banding, and partial or complete suture ligation or by percutaneous transvenous coil embolization. There is no strong evidence to recommend one surgical technique over another. Medical treatment strategies include administration of non-absorbable disaccharides (i.e., lactulose), antibiotics, and dietary changes, and are indicated for pre-surgical stabilization or when surgical intervention is not feasible. After CPSS attenuation, short- and long-term post-surgical complications may be seen, such as post-operative seizures and recurrence of clinical signs, respectively. Prognosis after surgical attenuation of CPSS is generally favorable for dogs and fair for cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235430</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Outlook of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: Challenges to Their Clinical Application in Horses.</Title>	<Abstract>Adipose tissue is recognized as the major endocrine organ, potentially acting as a source of mesenchymal stem cells for various applications in regenerative medicine. Athletic horses are often exposed to traumatic injuries, resulting in severe financial losses. The development of adipose-derived stem cells' regenerative potential depends on many factors. The extraction of stem cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue is non-invasive, non-traumatic, cheaper, and safer than other sources. Since there is a lack of unique standards for identification, the isolated cells and applied differentiation protocols are often not species-specific; therefore, the cells cannot reveal their multipotent properties, so their stemness features remain questionable. The current review discusses some aspects of the specificity of equine adipose stem cells concerning their features, immunophenotyping, secretome profile, differentiation abilities, culturing conditions, and consequent possibilities for clinical application in concrete disorders. The presented new approaches elucidate the possibility of the transition from cell-based to cell-free therapy with regenerative purposes in horses as an alternative treatment to cellular therapy. In conclusion, their clinical benefits should not be underestimated due to the higher yield and the physiological properties of adipose-derived stem cells that facilitate the healing and tissue regeneration process and the ability to amplify the effects of traditional treatments. More profound studies are necessary to apply these innovative approaches when treating traumatic disorders in racing horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Secondary bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections frequently complicate and aggravate the lesions, as well as the progression of this disease. CPL has a particularly high prevalence of up to 85.86% in the Belgian draft horse breed. Due to the disease's progressive and incurable nature, affected horses are often euthanized prematurely. The treatment options are solely symptomatic, aimed at improving the horse's quality of life. Despite the severity of this condition, many uncertainties about its etiology and pathogenesis still remain to date. The established scientific research on CPL is rather limited, although there is an urgent need for strategies to tackle this disease. This review summarizes the available knowledge, serving as a guideline for practitioners, and provides perspectives for future research programs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we present a xenograft model based on the ostrich (struthio camelus) CAM assay for the first time. The engraftment of 2 &#215; 10[6] breast cancer carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells successfully lead to tumor formation. Tumor growth monitoring was evaluated in eight fertilized eggs after xenotransplantation. Cancer cells were injected directly onto the CAM surface, close to a well-vascularized area. Histological analysis confirmed the epithelial origin of tumors. The CAM of ostrich embryos provides a large experimental surface for the xenograft, while the comparably long developmental period allows for a long experimental window for tumor growth and treatment. These advantages could make the ostrich CAM assay an attractive alternative to the well-established chick embryo model. Additionally, the large size of ostrich embryos compared to mice and rats could help overcome the limitations of small animal models. The suggested ostrich model is promising for future applications, for example, in radiopharmaceutical research, the size of the embryonal organs may compensate for the loss in image resolution caused by physical limitations in small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235433</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Integration of Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking to Analyse the Mechanism of Action of Oregano Essential Oil in the Treatment of Bovine Mastitis.</Title>	<Abstract>The active components, potential targets, and mechanisms of action of oregano essential oil in the treatment of bovine mastitis disease were investigated using network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. The TCMSP and literature databases were examined for the main compounds in oregano essential oil. Afterward, the physical, chemical, and bioavailability characteristics of the components were evaluated. The PubChem, BATMAN, PharmMapper, and Uniprot databases were utilized to predict the target genes of the major components of oregano essential oil. Via the databases of DrugBank, OMIM, GeneCards, TTD, and DisGenet, the disease targets of bovine mastitis were discovered. We analyzed common targets and built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the STRING database. Key genes were analyzed, obtained, and compound-target-pathway-disease visualization networks were created using Cytoscape. For the GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the DAVID database was utilized. Molecular docking via Autodock Tools was utilized to evaluate the reliability of the interactions between oregano essential oil and hub targets. Thymol, carvacrol, and p-cymene are the three major components found in oregano essential oil. The potential targets (TNF, TLR4, ALB, IL-1&#946;, TLR2, IL-6, IFNG, and MyD88) were screened according to the visual network. The enrichment analysis suggested that the major signaling pathways in network pharmacology may include PI3K-Akt, MAPK, IL-17, and NF-&#954; B. Molecular docking analysis shows that thymol had good docking activity with TNF, IL-6, and MyD88, carvacrol had good docking activity with TNF, and p-cymene had good docking activity with ALB. This study clarified the mechanism of action of oregano essential oil in the treatment of bovine mastitis, thus providing data supporting the potential for the use of oregano essential oil in the development of new therapeutics for bovine mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of transportation on some blood variables of 45 young bulls moved from their original farms to a livestock collection centre. Transportation took no more than 8 h and was carried out between January and March 2021. Blood samples were taken before transportation (T0), upon arrival at the collection centre (T1), and 7 days after arrival (T2). Samples were processed for blood cell count, clinical chemistry analyses, serum protein electrophoresis, and the evaluation of innate immunity parameters. The results showed a typical stress leukogram with neutrophilia and changes in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. No significant alterations were observed in either serum proteins or pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significant, albeit transient, alterations were observed in some clinical chemistry parameters after transportation, which could be accounted for by stressful conditions such as the transportation itself and handling and mixing with other animals. Our results indicated that the adopted transportation conditions only slightly affected the blood variables under study with no significant impact on animal welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the current state of AMR in rabbits attended to in veterinary clinics distributed in Spain. Records of 3596 microbiological results of clinical cases submitted from 2010 to 2021 were analyzed. Staphylococcus spp. (15.8%), Pseudomonas spp. (12.7%), Pasteurella spp. (10%), Bordetella spp. (9.6%) and Streptococcus spp. (6.8%) were the most frequently diagnosed agents. Enterobacteriaceae, principally Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, accounted for about 18% of the cases and showed the highest proportion of multi-drug resistance (MDR) isolates, with 48%, 57.5% and 36% of MDR, respectively. Regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility testing for a number of antimicrobial categories/families, the largest proportion of isolates showing resistance to a median of five antimicrobial categories was observed in P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkolderia spp. In contrast, infections caused by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus spp. and Pasteurella multocida were highly sensitive to conventional antimicrobials authorized for veterinary use (categories D and C). The emergence of AMR major nosocomial opportunistic pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and K. pneumoniae in pet rabbits can represent a serious public health challenge. Consequently, collaboration between veterinarians and human health professionals is crucial in the fight against antimicrobial resistance, to optimize, rationalize and prudently use antimicrobial therapies in domestic animals and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dogs with extrahepatic portosystemic shunts that could not tolerate complete acute shunt closure received a partial attenuation with either a polypropylene suture or synthetic polymer thin film band. At a routine second surgery three months after shunt patency, missed shunt branches and/or development of multiple acquired shunts were assessed using intra-operative mesenteric portovenography. Twenty-four dogs were enrolled, 12 received partial polypropylene suture ligation, and 12 received partial thin film band shunt attenuation. Intra-operative mesenteric portovenography three months later demonstrated that nine dogs (75%) in the thin film band group had achieved complete shunt closure versus two dogs (16.7%) in the polypropylene suture group, which was significantly different (p = 0.004). No dogs in the polypropylene suture group and two dogs (16.7%) in the thin film band group developed multiple acquired shunts. This is the first study directly comparing follow-up intra-operative mesenteric portovenography imaging findings between two methods of partial portosystemic shunt attenuation in dogs. The study provides accurate information on the rates of complete anatomical shunt closure and development of multiple acquired shunts following partial shunt attenuation with either synthetic polymer thin film band or polypropylene suture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we found that the number of T. gondii (Pru) in the lungs of co-infected mice was significantly higher and lesions were more severe than those in the group infected with T. gondii (Pru) alone, whereas IAV (influenza A virus) copy numbers of co-infected and PR8 alone infected groups were negligible, suggesting that infection with IAV increased the pathogenicity of T. gondii (Pru) in mice. The invasion and proliferation assays demonstrated no significant effect of co-infection on T. gondii (Pru) infection or replication in vitro. To further explore the factors causing the altered pathogenicity of T. gondii (Pru) caused by co-infection, we found that decreased expression levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-12 in the co-infected group were associated with the early immune responses against T. gondii (Pru), which affected the division of T. gondii (Pru). Moreover, the significant decrease in the CD4[+]/CD8[+] ratio indicated a weakened long-term immune killing ability of the host against T. gondii (Pru) following IAV infection. In conclusion, a T. gondii type II strain (Pru) could not be properly cleared by the host immune system after IAV infection, resulting in toxoplasmosis and even death in mice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physical examination revealed a poor body condition, a peripheral lymphadenomegaly, and suspected splenomegaly. A complete blood count (Sysmex XN-V) revealed marked leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and abnormal dot plots. An abnormal monomorphic lymphoid population and marked rouleaux formation were noted on the blood smear. Lymph node aspirates contained an atypical bimorphic population of lymphocytes, either with a plasmacytoid or a blastic appearance. This double population was also found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, tonsils, and other tissues. Peripheral blood and lymph node clonality assays revealed clonal BCR gene rearrangement. Flow cytometry revealed a mixed population of small-sized B-cells (CD79a+ CD21+ MHCII+) and medium-sized B-cells (CD79a+ CD21- MHCII-) in lymph nodes and a dominant population of small-sized mature B-cells (CD21+ MHCII+) in peripheral blood. Though normoproteinemic, serum protein electrophoresis revealed an increased &#945;2-globulin fraction with an atypical restricted peak, identified as monoclonal IgM by immunofixation. Urine protein immunofixation revealed a Bence-Jones proteinuria. A diagnosis of Waldenstr&#246;m's macroglobulinemia was made.

About 385 serum samples were compiled from small ruminants (239) and large ruminants (146) and tested using 3ABC-Mab-bELISA. An overall apparent seroprevalence of 67.0% was documented. The highest seroprevalence of 81.1% was reported in the Swat, followed by 76.6% in Mohmand, 72.7% in Gilgit, 65.6% in Shangla, 63.4% in Bajaur, 46.6% in Chitral and lowest 46.5% in Khyber region. Statistically significant variations in seroprevalence of 51.5%, 71.8%, 58.3%, and 74.4% were recorded in sheep, goats, cattle, and buffaloes, respectively. From the different risk factors investigated, age, sex, species of animal, seasons, flock/herd size, farming methods, outbreak location, and nomadic animal movement were found to be significantly associated (p &lt; 0.05) with the seroprevalence of FMD. It was concluded that proper epidemiological study, risk-based FMD surveillance in small ruminants, vaccination strategy, control measures for transboundary animal movement, collaborations, and awareness programs need to be practiced in the study regions to investigate the newly circulating virus strains in large and small ruminants and associated factors for the wide seroprevalence to plan proper control policies to bound the consequence of FMD in the region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The importance of the One Health/One World concept and its social impact is increasing significantly, accompanied by the notoriety of new emerging and reemerging zoonoses. This paper aims to review and anchor the main concepts and professional applications of zoological medicine, which has been extensively discussed and adapted in recent decades. In addition, we analyse the main social demands, training, and educational needs and the perception of veterinary professionals relating to this specialised veterinary discipline. Our final goal is to reinforce the use of the term zoological medicine and contribute to highlight the need to foster and underpin specific educational policies and programs on this matter in the veterinary curricula. Zoological medicine should be the appropriate and agreed-upon term in the academic language concerning the veterinary medicine of pets, wild, or zoo species, excluding traditional domestic animals, and integrating the principles of ecology and conservation, applied to both natural and artificial environments. This discipline has suffered an intense evolution covering applications in private clinics, zoos, bioparks, and wildlife. All this implies current and future challenges for the veterinary profession that can only be addressed with greater and better attention from multiple perspectives, especially the education and training of professionals to improve and specialise in their professional scope of services.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The neonatal period is critical for buffalo calves and is characterized by a high mortality rate (more than 40%). The early intake of high-quality colostrum (IgG &gt; 50 mg/mL) is the one way to improve the immune system of calves (serum IgG &gt; 10 mg/mL after 12 h), thus increasing their chances of survival. Mainly in intensive farms, the availability of high-quality colostrum is necessary; thus, good quality colostrum is often stored to provide newborn calves which cannot be fed by their mothers. Also, the manipulation of the immunological status of animals through vaccination has been depicted since the quality of colostrum tended to be influenced by vaccination against pathogens. Buffalo breeding is constantly expanding in Italy, mainly thanks to the Mozzarella cheese production that represents the excellence of the "Made in Italy" and is exported worldwide. Indeed, high calf mortality rates directly affect the profitability of the business. For these reasons, the aim of this review was to examine specific research on buffalo colostrum that, compared with other species, are scarce. Improving the knowledge of buffalo colostrum, in terms of characteristics and management, is critical to guarantee buffalo newborns' health in order to reduce their mortality rate. Importantly, considering the knowledge on cattle valid also for buffalo is a widespread, and often erroneous, habit in several fields, including colostrum feeding. Therefore, the two species were compared in this review.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although an increasing number of studies have shown that gut microbiota can control the progression of diseases caused by viral infections, it has not been characterized how the ASF virus (ASFV) changes a pig's gut microbiome. This study analyzed the dynamic changes in the intestinal microbiome of pigs experimentally infected with the high-virulence ASFV genotype II strain (N = 4) or mock strain (N = 3). Daily fecal samples were collected from the pigs and distributed into the four phases (before infection, primary phase, clinical phase, and terminal phase) of ASF based on the individual clinical features of the pigs. The total DNA was extracted and the V4 region of the 16 s rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Richness indices (ACE and Chao1) were significantly decreased in the terminal phase of ASF infection. The relative abundances of short-chain-fatty-acids-producing bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae, Roseburia, and Blautia, were decreased during ASFV infection. On the other hand, the abundance of Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes increased. Furthermore, predicted functional analysis using PICRUSt resulted in a significantly reduced abundance of 15 immune-related pathways in the ASFV-infected pigs. This study provides evidence for further understanding the ASFV-pig interaction and suggests that changes in gut microbiome composition during ASFV infection may be associated with the status of immunosuppression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

According to the taxonomic analysis, most of the bones with macrostructural changes originated from cattle (N = 27, 54% of the total number of bones with macrostructural changes), followed by the bones of small ruminants (N = 12, 24%) and pigs (N = 8, 16%). The horse, carnivore and chicken were represented with one bone each (2%). Radiological examination showed that three samples (6%) had a regular bone macrostructure, i.e., no pathological changes were visible upon radiological examination. The majority (64%) of pathologically altered bones are a consequence of keeping/working, followed by traumatic causes (20%). Changes in the oral cavity were found in 10% of specimens. Our study showed that gross examination will continue to be the primary method for the identification of pathologically altered remains in archaeozoological material. However, diagnostic imaging techniques such as radiography should be implemented to confirm or exclude suspected alterations and to help the classification of the specimen by etiology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Enteric specimens collected from 29 cats with acute enteritis and 33 non-diarrhoeic cats were screened in PCRs and reverse transcription (RT) PCR for a large panel of enteric viruses, including also orphan viruses of recent identification. At least one viral species, including feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV), feline chaphamaparvovirus, calicivirus (vesivirus and novovirus), feline kobuvirus, feline sakobuvirus A and Lyon IARC polyomaviruses, was detected in 66.1% of the samples.. Co-infections were mainly accounted for by FPV and FCoV and were detected in 24.2% of the samples. The virome composition was further assessed in eight diarrhoeic samples, through the construction of sequencing libraries using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) protocol. The libraries were sequenced on Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. A total of 41 contigs (&gt;100 nt) were detected from seven viral families infecting mammals, included Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Anelloviridae, Papillomaviridae and Paramyxoviridae, revealing a broad variety in the composition of the feline enteric virome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235446</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Serum Bicarbonate Deficiency in Dogs with Acute and Chronic Kidney Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>Serum bicarbonate deficiency is a disorder frequently found in human patients with acute (AKI) and chronic (CKD) kidney disease, due to abnormalities in kidney generation and reabsorption of bicarbonate. Although alkali supplementation is usually performed in both humans and veterinary CKD patients, data regarding the frequency of bicarbonate disorders in AKI and CKD dogs are scarce. The aim of the present study is to assess the frequency and the severity of bicarbonate deficiency of dogs affected by AKI, acute chronic kidney disease (ACKD), and CKD, and to investigate its possible association with the IRIS grade/stage as well as with disorders of calcium phosphate metabolism. A retrospective evaluation of the serum biochemical panels of all dogs with diagnoses of AKI, ACKD, and CKD referred to the nephrology and urology service of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Pisa, between January 2014 and January 2022, was performed. Bicarbonate deficiency was defined as serum bicarbonate &lt; 22 mmol/L and classified as moderate (between 18 and 22 mmol/L) or severe (&lt;18 mmol/L). Serum bicarbonate deficiency was found in 397/521 dogs (76%), of which 142/397 (36%) showed moderate deficiency, and 255/397 (64%) severe deficiency. Dogs with AKI and ACKD showed a significantly higher frequency of bicarbonate deficiency (p = 0.004) and severe forms compared to CKD dogs (p = 0.02). In AKI and ACKD dogs, a negative linear correlation was found between serum bicarbonate and serum creatinine, urea, and phosphate. The frequency of bicarbonate deficiency was higher in the later stages of the disease in both AKI (p = 0.01), ACKD (p = 0.0003), and CKD dogs (p = 0.009). Dogs with serum CaxP &#8805; 70 mg[2]/dL[2] showed a higher frequency of bicarbonate deficiency (p = 0.01) and showed severe forms (p = 0.01) compared to dogs with CaxP &lt; 70 mg[2]/dL[2]. Serum bicarbonate deficiency seems to be a very frequent disorder in both AKI, ACKD, and CKD dogs, with an increasing frequency and severity in more advanced stages of kidney disease. The higher frequency and severity of bicarbonate deficiency in AKI and ACKD may be caused by a more severe and sudden loss of kidney function, or extra-renal factors. Finally, the association between frequency and severity of bicarbonate deficiency and abnormal CaxP may suggest a potential connection between metabolic acidosis and bone mineral disorders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Laying hens (60 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had five replicates, and each replicate had 45 hens. The control group was fed with a corn-soybean-based diet, and the experimental groups were fed with 1% HILM, 2% HILM, or 3% HILM. Results were as follows: (1) With the increase in HILM level, the laying rate increased linearly (p &#8804; 0.05), and the feed/egg and cracked-egg rate decreased linearly (p &#8804; 0.05). (2) Community composition analysis showed that the dominant bacteria in each group were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, followed by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which accounted for more than 97% of 16S rRNA gene sequence of the total cecal bacteria. (3) Alpha diversity analysis at the operational taxonomic unit classification level showed that the HILM-addition groups had higher community richness and community diversity than the control group. (4) Principal co-ordinates analysis showed that the cecum samples in each group were significantly separated (p &#8804; 0.05). At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the HILM addition groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001), and the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the HILM addition groups was significantly higher than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, dietary HILM supplementation had a significant effect on the production performance and cecal microflora of laying hens at the late laying period under the conditions of this experiment but had no adverse effect on the intestinal dominant flora.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Highly Pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (HP-PRRSV2HP-PRRSV2) and Gps coinfections are epidemics in China, but little is known about the influence of concurrent coinfection on disease severity and inflammatory responses. Herein, we studied the effects of secondary HP-PRRS infection on clinical symptoms, pathological changes, pathogen load, and inflammatory response of Gps coinfection in the upper respiratory tract of piglets. All coinfected piglets (HP-PRRSV2 + Gps) displayed fever and severe lesions in the lungs, while fever was present in only a few animals with a single infection (HP-PRRSV2 or Gps). Additionally, HP-PRRSV2 and Gps loading in nasal swabs and blood and lung tissue samples was significantly increased in the coinfected group. Necropsy data showed that coinfected piglets suffered from severe lung damage and had significantly higher antibody titers of HP-PRRSV2 or Gps than single-infected piglets. Moreover, the serum and lung concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-8) were also significantly higher in coinfected piglets than in those infected with HP-PRRSV2 or Gps alone. In conclusion, our results show that HP-PRRSV2 promotes the shedding and replication of Gps, and their coinfection in the upper respiratory tract aggravates the clinical symptoms and inflammatory responses, causing lung damage. Therefore, in the unavoidable situation of Gps infection in piglets, necessary measures must be made to prevent and control secondary infection with HP-PRRSV2, which can save huge economic losses to the pork industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Producers from the Canadian Cow-Calf Surveillance Network (87%, 146/168) provided data and almost all reported AMU in at least one animal (99%, 145/146 herds) in 2019-2020. The most common reasons for AMU were treatment of respiratory disease in nursing calves in 78% of herds and neonatal diarrhea in 67% of herds, as well as for lameness in cows in 83% of herds. However, most herds treated &lt;5% of animals for these reasons. Less than 2.5% of herds treated more than 30% of calves for either bovine respiratory disease or neonatal diarrhea and no herds treated more than 30% of cows for lameness. The most frequently reported antimicrobial was oxytetracycline in 81% of herds, followed by florfenicol in 73% of herds. Antimicrobials with very high importance to human health, such as ceftiofur, were used at least once by 20% of herds but were only used in &gt;30% of nursing calves from one herd. Similarly, while 56% of herds used macrolides at least once, within-herd use was the highest in nursing calves where &lt;4% of herds reported use in &gt;30% of animals. Herds using artificial insemination and calving in the winter were more likely (p = 0.05) to treat &gt;5% of nursing calves for respiratory disease, suggesting the importance of vaccination programs for herds at risk. Overall, AMU was similar to previous Canadian studies; however, the percentage of herds using macrolides had increased from a comparable study in 2014.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37235450</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Are They Thinking Differently? The Perceptions and Differences in Medical Disputes between Veterinarians and Clients.</Title>	<Abstract>Medical disputes in veterinary practices are widespread; yet, a limited amount of research has been conducted to investigate the factors contributing to medical disputes. This study examined veterinarians' and clients' perceptions regarding risk factors and possible solutions to medical disputes. A total of 245 respondents from Taiwan, including 125 veterinarians and 120 clients, completed an electronic self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire in 2022. The questionnaire covered six dimensions: medical skills, complaint management, the attitudes of stakeholders during interactions, medical expenses, clients' perspectives, and communication modes. The results highlighted significant differences in the perceptions of risk factors for inducing medical disputes and possible solutions between clients and veterinarians in veterinary practice. First, young veterinarians and clients perceived medical skills as the highest risk factor for inducing medical disputes, while experienced veterinarians disagreed (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, veterinarians with medical dispute experience identified stakeholders' attitudes during interactions as the top contributing factor. Second, regarding possible solutions, all veterinarians preferred offering clients cost estimates and cultivating empathy and compassion towards them. On the other hand, clients underscored the importance of obtaining informed consent for treatments and expenses and suggested that veterinarians should supply comprehensive written information to facilitate this process. This study underlies the importance of understanding stakeholders' perceptions to mitigate medical disputes and advocates for improved communication education and training for young veterinarians. These findings provide valuable insights for veterinarians and clients, contributing to preventing and managing medical disputes in veterinary practices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37368754</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effect of Nutritional Flushing Using Long-Term Energy and Protein Supplementation on Growth Performance and Reproductive Parameters of Doyogena Ewes in Ethiopia.</Title>	<Abstract>The objective of the study was to establish the effect of appropriate supplementation days (days -21 to +7) using four isonitrogenous (14.7% CP) diets balanced to provide low (Lo-ME) or high (Hi-ME) metabolizable energy on the body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW) change, and reproductive performances of sheep. Thirty-five Doyogena ewes (27.71 &#177; 2.87 kg, 2-5 years of age, BCS of 2.0-2.5) grazing on natural pasture were randomly assigned to supplementary treatments consisting of combinations of enset leaf (EL) and commercial concentrate (CC): T0 (control), T1 (250 g EL + 500 g CC: Lo-ME), T2 (400 g EL + 500 g CC; Hi-ME), T3 (500 g EL + 400 g CC; Hi-ME), and T4 (500 g EL + 250 g CC; Lo-ME). The estrous cycle was synchronized with one intramuscular injection, 5 mg PGF2&#945;, prior to artificial insemination. The dry matter (DM) from the pasture provided 1.10-1.46 kg/day, which corresponds to the DM requirements of the ewes until late gestation. However, the pasture provided a protein content of 9.52%, which was insufficient for breeding, mid-gestation, and gestation, requiring minimums of 16.1%, 13.1%, and 14.8%, respectively. The pasture could only provide enough energy for breeding ewes with a BW of up to 30 kg. The energy provided by pasture was insufficient for ewes weighing &gt; 30 kg at mid-gestation and gestation, providing 6.9-9.2 MJ/day, below the requirement of 11.92-16.32 MJ/day required for mid-gestation and gestation. The energy was not sufficient for large ewes weighing &gt; 40 kg. Supplementary diets T1-T4 provided DM in the range of 1.7-2.29 kg/day. This was sufficient for AI, mid-gestation, and gestation phases. Dietary supplements increased (p &lt; 0.01) BW during breeding and mid-gestation. During lambing, T2 and T3 increased BW (p &lt; 0.05) compared to T4 and T1. T4 had a similar effect (p &gt; 0.05) on BW during lambing. T1, T2, and T3 significantly increased BCS (p &lt; 0.05). T2 and T3 increased (p &lt; 0.05) BCS at mid-gestation, but only T2 significantly increased BCD (p &lt; 0.05) during lambing. All dietary supplements resulted in a shorter (p &lt; 0.05) time to the resumption of estrous and the length of estrous (p &lt; 0.05). T1, T2, and T3 resulted in a stronger estrous response (p &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplements enhanced (p &lt; 0.05) the conception rate and fecundity rate. The conception rate was highest in T2 and T3 at 85.7% and 83.3%, respectively. T2 had the highest fecundity rate at 151.7% (p &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation increased the rate of lambing (LR), litter size (LS), and weight of lambs at birth (LBW). The LR for treatments T2, T3, and T4 was 100% versus 66.7% in the control. T1 and T2 significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) LS, but T4 had a similar LS to the control. Dietary supplements T1, T3, and T4 tended to increase (p &lt; 0.05) LBW, but T2 increased LBW significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Supplementation (T2, T3) with 400 g enset + 500 g CC and 500 g enset + 400 g CC are promising feed supplements to increase the reproductive capacities of Doyogena ewes in Ethiopia. Energy is as important to ewe flushing as protein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The scope of the present study was to observe the impact of a feed supplement containing carvacrol (CAR) and limonene (LIM) on the performance and parasitological status of sheep. The feed supplement decreased the plasma levels of &#946;-hydroxybutyrate (p &lt; 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.014), nonesterified fatty acids (p = 0.021), and fructosamine (p = 0.002) in lactating ewes after 42 days of supplementation, while the average live weight (p = 0.002) and average daily weight gain (p = 0.001) of their twin suckling lambs increased significantly by the end of the study. In another experiment, fattening lambs fed the same supplement showed a decrease in fecal egg number of gastrointestinal nematodes (p = 0.02) but no differences in live weight, average daily gain, or mean number of Haemonchus contortus nematodes in the abomasum. The results highlighted that the inclusion of carvacrol and limonene in the feed of lactating ewes effectively increased the weight gain of the suckling lambs, presumably due to the ewes' improved energy, but further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of carvacrol and limonene against gastrointestinal parasites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred and thirty female dairy cows (65 endometritis affected and 65 apparently healthy) were used. Nucleotide sequence variations between healthy and endometritis-affected cows were revealed using PCR-DNA sequencing for immune (TLR4, TLR7, TNF-&#945;, IL10, NCF4, and LITAF), antioxidant (ATOX1, GST, and OXSR1), and erythritol-related (TKT, RPIA, and AMPD1) genes. Chi-square investigation exposed a noteworthy variance amongst cow groups with and without endometritis in likelihood of dispersal of all distinguished nucleotide variants (p &lt; 0.05). The IL10, ATOX1, and GST genes were expressed at substantially lower levels in endometritis-affected cows. Gene expression levels were considerably higher in endometritis-affected cows than in resistant ones for the genes TLR4, TLR7, TNF-&#945;, NCF4, LITAF, OXSR1, TKT, RPIA, and AMPD1. The sort of marker and vulnerability or resistance to endometritis had a significant impact on the transcript levels of the studied indicators. The outcomes might confirm the importance of nucleotide variants along with gene expression patterns as markers of postparturient endometritis susceptibility/resistance and provide a workable control plan for Holstein dairy cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37368757</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Femoral Neck Thickness Index as an Indicator of Proximal Femur Bone Modeling.</Title>	<Abstract>The alteration in the shape of the femoral neck is an important radiographic sign for scoring canine hip dysplasia (CHD). Previous studies have reported that the femoral neck thickness (FNT) is greater in dogs with hip joint dysplasia, becoming progressively thicker with disease severity. The main objective of this work was to describe a femoral neck thickness index (FNTi) to quantify FNT and to study its association with the degree of CHD using the F&#233;d&#233;ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) scheme. A total of 53 dogs (106 hips) were randomly selected for this study. Two examiners performed FNTi estimation to study intra- and inter-examiner reliability and agreement. The paired t-test, the Bland-Altman plots, and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed excellent agreement and reliability between the measurements of the two examiners and the examiners' sessions. All joints were scored in five categories by an experienced examiner according to FCI criteria. The results from examiner 1 were compared between FCI categories. Hips that were assigned an FCI grade of A (n = 19), B (n = 23), C (n = 24), D (n = 24), and E (n = 16) had a mean &#177; standard deviation FNTi of 0.809 &#177; 0.024, 0.835 &#177; 0.044, 0.868 &#177; 0.022, 0.903 &#177; 0.033, and 0.923 &#177; 0.068, respectively (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, these results show that FNTi is a parameter capable of evaluating proximal femur bone modeling and that it has the potential to enrich conventional CHD scoring criteria if incorporated into a computer-aided diagnosis capable of detecting CHD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A single dose of a long-acting opioid analgesic can provide up to 72 h of clinically relevant pain management. Yet, few of these new drugs have been translated to products for veterinary clinics. Regulatory pathways allow accelerated drug approvals for generic and biosimilar drugs. These pathways depend on rigorous evidence for drug safety and pharmacokinetic evidence demonstrating bioequivalence between the new and the legacy drug. This report reviews the animal PK data associated with lipid and polymer-bound buprenorphine LAI formulations. Buprenorphine is a widely used veterinary opioid analgesic. Because of its safety profile and regulatory status, buprenorphine is more accessible than morphine, methadone, and fentanyl. This review of PK studies coupled with the well-established safety profile of buprenorphine suggests that the accelerated approval pathways may be available for this new family of LAI veterinary pharmaceuticals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Beef and dairy bulls (n = 16; 2.7 &#177; 0.4 years old; body condition score 3.2 &#177; 0.1) of five breeds were maintained under the same conditions at an accredited semen collection center. Bulls underwent routine semen collection twice weekly for 12 weeks and semen was processed and cryopreserved. Ultrasonography and hair sampling were undertaken at the last semen collection. Bulls with homogeneous testicular parenchyma (n = 8) had a higher (p &lt; 0.05) percentage of motile sperm post-thawing compared with bulls with heterogeneous parenchyma (n = 8). There were no differences (p &gt; 0.05) in the hair concentrations of cortisol, DHEA-S, and testosterone between bulls with homogeneous and heterogeneous parenchyma. In bulls with homogeneous parenchyma, hair DHEA-S concentration was positively correlated with percentage motile sperm (R[2] = 0.76), progressively motile sperm (R[2] = 0.70), and motility yield (R[2] = 0.71). The findings indicate that the integration of testicular ultrasonography and hair DHEA-S status in the BBSE could provide a more comprehensive assessment of indicative fertility in bulls. Additionally, ultrasonography can be used in the BBSE when the evaluation of semen parameters is not available.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the present study, we described the flow cytometric (FC) cell size (FSC) and fluorescence intensity (MFI) of B- and T-lymphocytes in 42 canine reactive lymph nodes and 36 lymphomas. Proliferative activity (Ki67%) in reactive lymph nodes was also reported. Reactive lymph nodes were composed of a mixed population of small and large T (CD5+) and B (CD21+) cells. Small T-cells were larger in size than small B-cells, and large T-cells were larger than large B-cells. Small T-cells were composed of CD5+CD21- and CD5+CD21+dim subpopulations. Large B-cells were &lt;20% in reactive lymph nodes and &gt;20% in lymphomas and showed a higher FSC in lymphomas than in reactive lymph nodes. Large T-cells were &lt;4% in reactive lymph nodes and &gt;4% in lymphomas and showed a higher CD5 MFI in lymphomas (if expressed) compared to reactive lymph nodes. A subset of CD5+CD21+dim lymphocytes was recognized in addition to CD5+CD21- and CD5-CD21+ cells. In T-zone lymphomas, neoplastic cells had higher FSC and CD21 MFI values than small CD5+CD21+dim cells in reactive lymph nodes. Ki67% values were higher than those reported in normal lymph nodes, and largely overlapped with those reported in low-grade lymphomas and partially in high-grade lymphomas. Our results may contribute to making a less operator-dependent FC differential between lymphoma and reactive lymph nodes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, two adult female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were evaluated for cutaneous lesions. Scab, fur, and swab samples from the external auditory canal, cutaneous lesions, and scrapings were analyzed. Canine distemper virus (CDV)-positive samples underwent RT-PCR/RFLP with the restriction enzyme PsiI, and the hemagglutinin gene sequence was obtained. According to the restriction enzyme and sequence analyses, the viral strains were typed as CDV field strains that are included within the Europe lineage and distinct from those including vaccinal CDV strains. The sequence analysis showed the highest nucleotide identity rates in older Europe lineage CDV strains collected from dogs and a fox in Europe. This study is the first to report on CDV infection in ferrets in southern Italy and contributes to the current knowledge about natural CDV infection in this species. In conclusion, vaccination remains crucial for preventing the disease and counteracting cross-species infection. Molecular biology techniques can enable the monitoring of susceptible wild animals by ensuring the active surveillance of CDV spread.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They often represent unusual findings in live animals and are incidental at slaughter with rare positive therapeutic outcomes for farmers. A 9-year-old beef cow was referred to the hospital of ruminants of the National Veterinary School of Toulouse, France. The cow started to become sick 10 days prior, and major symptoms were anorexia, arched back, tachycardia, and tachypnea associated with significantly attenuated cardiac and pulmonary sounds upon right-sided auscultation. After specific investigations, a thoracic sarcoma associated with unilateral empyema was diagnosed. The empyema was treated, and supportive treatment was only performed for the tumor. Although the sarcoma remained, clinical improvement was significant, and the cow went back to her farm of origin. After the end of the withdrawal period, the cow recovered clinically but was culled by the owners for economic reasons. The present case report offers a continuum from the initial clinical signs motivating specific investigations to interesting laboratory findings, which were confirmed post-mortem.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, little is known regarding the outcomes of this approach. This study described the outcomes and investigated prognostic factors in 40 dogs with multiple sites of cervical disc extrusion or protrusion on MRI who underwent ventral slot decompression for the single acute disc. The overall recovery rate was 97.5%. The median recovery time was seven days. The number of affected discs (including disc extrusion and protrusion) and the presence and number of the affected discs causing severe spinal compression did not influence the 30-day outcome. Compared with 23 dogs with single disc extrusion treated surgically, the recovery time and outcomes were similar between the two groups. The total number of affected discs was not associated with recovery time or outcomes. In conclusion, if an acute disc could be identified, ventral slot decompression targeting the single acute disc is a viable management approach for dogs with an acute presentation but diagnosed with multiple sites of spinal cord compression from IVDD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Identifying the early signs of anthelmintic resistance (AR) is necessary to sustainably manage bovine parasitic infections. This study aimed to evaluate the resistance status of bovine parasitic nematodes against FBZ on a farm with a known history of broad-spectrum anthelmintic usage in Ecuador. FBZ efficacy was analyzed using a fecal egg count reduction test (FECR test) and &#946;-tubulin 1 mutation identification in Cooperia spp., the dominant nematode parasite identified before and after treatment. According to the FECR test, the nematode population was susceptible to FBZ. After amplifying and cloning the &#946;-tubulin 1 of Cooperia spp., an F200Y mutation was found in 43% of the pooled larva coproculture after treatment. This study reports, for the first time, the presence of F200Y resistance-conferring mutation in Cooperia spp. in Ecuador. Although the nematode population was phenotypically susceptible to FBZ, the presence of F200Y suggests the existence of resistance in the early stages. Our findings highlight the need to implement alternative control strategies for parasitic infections besides broad-spectrum anthelmintics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Female dogs are considered attractive models or studying spontaneous breast cancer, whereas female rats are currently the most widely used animal models for breast cancer research in the laboratory context. Both female dogs and female rats have contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge in this field, and, in a "One Health" approach, they have allowed broad understanding of specific biopathological pathways, influence of environmental factors and screening/discovery of candidate therapies. This review aims to clearly showcase the similarities and differences among woman, female dog and female rat concerning to anatomical, physiological and histological features of the mammary gland and breast/mammary cancer epidemiology, in order to better portray breast tumorigenesis, and to ensure appropriate conclusions and extrapolation of results among species. We also discuss the major aspects that stand out in these species. The mammary glands of female dogs and women share structural similarities, especially with respect to the lactiferous ducts and lymphatic drainage. In contrast, female rats have only one lactiferous duct per nipple. A comprehensive comparison between humans and dogs is given a special focus, as these species share several aspects in terms of breast/mammary cancer epidemiology, such as age of onset, hormonal etiology, risk factors, and the clinical course of the disease. Holistically, it is clear that each species has advantages and limitations that researchers must consider during the development of experimental designs and data analysis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is characterized by systemic granulomatous inflammation and high mortality. We investigated the antiviral effect of liposome-loaded R, i.e., rottlerin-liposome (RL), against FCoV. We demonstrated that RL inhibited FCoV replication in a dose-dependent manner, not only in the early endocytosis stage but also in the late stage of replication. RL resolved the low solubility issue of rottlerin and improved its inhibition efficacy at the cellular level. Based on these findings, we suggest that RL is worth further investigation as a potential treatment for FCoV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of a porcine-specific ISC in a commercial porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) reverse transcription-qPCR. Study 1 evaluated the species specificity of the ISC by testing serum from seven non-porcine domestic species (n = 34). In Study 2, the constancy of ISC detection over time (&#8805;42 days) was assessed in oral fluid (n = 130), serum (n = 215), and feces (n = 132) collected from individual pigs of known PRRSV status. In Study 3, serum (n = 150), oral fluid (n = 150), and fecal samples (n = 75 feces, 75 fecal swabs) from commercial herds were used to establish ISC reference limits. Study 1 showed that the ISC was porcine-specific, i.e., all samples from non-porcine species were ISC negative (n = 34). In Study 2, the ISC was detected in all oral fluid, serum, and fecal samples, but differed in concentration between specimens (p &lt; 0.05; mixed-effects regression model). The results of Study 3 were used to establish ISC reference limits for the 5th, 2.5th and 1.25th percentiles. Overall, the ISC response was consistent to the point that failure in detection is sufficient justification for re-testing and/or re-sampling.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several other mammal species are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and multiple instances of transmission from humans to pets, farmed mink, wildlife and zoo animals have been recorded. We conducted a systematic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in all mammal species in two zoos in Belgium between September and December 2020 and July 2021, in four sessions, and a targeted surveillance of selected mammal enclosures following SARS-CoV-2 infection in hippopotamuses in December 2021. A total of 1523 faecal samples from 103 mammal species were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via real-time PCR. None of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additional surrogate virus neutralisation tests conducted on 50 routinely collected serum samples from 26 mammal species were all negative. This study is the first to our knowledge to conduct active SARS-CoV-2 surveillance for several months in all mammal species of a zoo. We conclude that at the time of our investigation, none of the screened animals were excreting SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37368769</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Development of a Universal Multi-Epitope Vaccine Candidate against Streptococcus suis Infections Using Immunoinformatics Approaches.</Title>	<Abstract>Streptococcus suis is a significant zoonotic pathogen that is a great threat not only to the swine industry but also to human health, causing arthritis, meningitis, and even streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. Owing to its many serotypes and high geographic variability, an efficacious cross-protective S. suis vaccine is not readily available. Therefore, this study aimed to design a universal multi-epitope vaccine (MVHP6) that involved three highly immunogenic proteins of S. suis, namely, the surface antigen containing a glycosaminoglycan binding domain (HP0197), endopeptidase (PepO), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). Forecasted T-cell and B-cell epitopes with high antigenic properties and a suitable adjuvant were linked to construct a multi-epitope vaccine. In silico analysis showed that the selected epitopes were conserved in highly susceptible serotypes for humans. Thereafter, we evaluated the different parameters of MVHP6 and showed that MVHP6 was highly antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic. To verify whether the vaccine could display appropriate epitopes and maintain high stability, the MVHP6 tertiary structure was modeled, refined, and validated. Molecular docking studies revealed a strong binding interaction between the vaccine and the toll-like receptor (TLR4), whereas molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the vaccine's compatibility, binding stability, and structural compactness. Moreover, the in silico analysis showed that MVHP6 could evoke strong immune responses and enable worldwide population coverage. Moreover, MVHP6 was cloned into the pET28a (+) vector in silico to ensure the credibility, validation, and proper expression of the vaccine construct. The findings suggested that the proposed multi-epitope vaccine can provide cross-protection against S. suis infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This condition is reported in both human and veterinary medicine following biliary tract rupture, extrahepatic biliary obstructions, gallbladder rupture, trauma, or duodenal perforation. In this report, the first-ever case of biliary peritonitis due to gastric perforation in a Bobtail purebred dog is described, which was probably induced by the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). After an elective splenectomy and castration, the dog was referred to our hospital for medical management for inappetence, mental depression, and multiple episodes of gastric vomits with traces of blood. Clinical diagnostic tests showed the presence of biliary peritonitis. Due to worsening clinical conditions, the patient was subjected to euthanasia. Macroscopic examination showed a free brownish abdominal effusion and the presence of perforating ulcer of the stomach pylorus region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cat also showed signs of hyponatremia and dehydration, which were rapidly corrected by intravenous fluid infusion. Based on thorough physical and neurological examinations, the patient was suspected of having an intracranial disease. MRI revealed a high-signal T2 image of the bilateral parietal cerebral cortical gray matter junction, which is associated with fast electrolyte calibration, and a high-signal T2 image of the C2 spinal cord ventral area, which is associated with ischemic myelopathy. The cat reappeared three days later due to anorexia. Laboratory examinations revealed that the cat was clinically dehydrated and exhibited hyponatremia. Other causes of hyponatremia were excluded through history-taking, laboratory examination, imaging, and therapeutic response to fluid therapy, except for cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS). The cat was discharged 3 days after the start of fludrocortisone therapy with electrolytes within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed again 1 month after hospitalization, and the cerebral lesion disappeared, but the spinal cord lesion worsened compared to the previous image. The patient was euthanized due to the progression of the spinal lesion, with a poor prognosis and poor quality of life. This is the first case of suspected CSWS with a cervical spinal lesion in a cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The surfaces of the floor, teat cup, and cow restraints were aseptically swabbed in three replicates (n = 27). Of the total number of infected cows (n = 43), 11 samples were found to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus, 12 samples tested positive for non-aureus staphylococci, 6 samples tested positive for Streptococcus spp., and 11 samples tested positive for other bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp.) or a mixed infection. The most represented pathogen in milk (11/43) and on surfaces (14/27) was S. aureus. The kinetics of adhesion of the reference strain and isolates of S. aureus on stainless steel surfaces were determined after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h, and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days of incubation. All strains reached counts higher than 5 Log10 CFU/cm[2] needed for biofilm formation, except RS (4.40 Log10 CFU/cm[2]). The isolates of S. aureus revealed a higher capability to form biofilm in comparison with RS during the first 3 h (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, there is a significant difference between the occurrence of S. aureus on monitored surfaces-floor, teat cup, and cow restraints-and the frequency with which mastitis is caused by S. aureus (p &lt; 0.05). This finding raises the possibility that if various surfaces are contaminated by S. aureus, it can result in the formation of biofilm, which is a significant virulence factor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite the numerous studies investigating the treatment of canine HSA, no significant improvement in survival has been achieved in the last 20 years. Advancements in genetic and molecular profiling presented molecular similarities between canine HSA and human angiosarcoma. It could therefore serve as a valuable model for investigating new and more effective treatments in people and dogs. The most common genetic abnormalities in canine HSA have been found in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) pathways. Mutations are also found in tumor protein p53 (TP53), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A). Known abnormal protein expression could be exploited to trial new target treatments that could be beneficial for both canine and human patients. Despite the high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR), no correlation with overall survival time has ever been found. In this review, we explore the most recent developments in molecular profiling in canine HSA and discuss their possible applications in the prognosis and treatment of this fatal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Radiography and computed tomography revealed severe atrophy of the proximal bone fragment and retardation of the ipsilateral distal fragment and tibia. An autogenous bone graft using coccygeal bone was performed, in which three and a half coccyges were placed in succession and fixed using an orthogonal locking plate. To promote bone healing and facilitate proper weight bearing and ambulation, bone morphogenetic proteins, biphasic calcium phosphate, platelet-rich plasma, passive-range-of-motion exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and low-level laser therapy were applied. During the four-year follow-up, it was observed that the previously engrafted bone healed well and maintained stability over a prolonged period, resulting in the patient being able to walk comfortably with good outcomes. However, some degree of lameness was noted in the dog when running owing to limb shortening and joint contracture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Given that the currently available options are not always totally effective and might have some associated adverse effects, novel alternatives are needed. For this reason, a new collar for CAD was developed with 2.5% of a sphingomyelin-rich lipid extract (LE) with proven benefits for skin health. The release of the active ingredient when incorporated into the collar was tested in vitro, showing an adequate kinetic profile. Then, the efficacy and safety of the collar were assessed in 12 client-owned dogs with CAD in a pilot study. After eight weeks, the dogs experienced significant clinical improvements on the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI)-4, Pruritus Index for Canine Atopic Dermatitis (PCAD) and Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale (PVAS) scores, without any adverse effects. Additionally, further in vitro studies were performed, indicating that this LE collar should be compatible with antiparasitic collars (with deltamethrin or imidacloprid/flumethrin) if worn simultaneously. Given the observed benefits of this LE collar, combining it with other CAD therapies could potentially allow for drug sparing, reduction in adverse effects, enhanced owner compliance, and reduced treatment costs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In addition to environmental and biological factors, genetic and epigenetic risk factors can influence predisposition to canine obesity, however, they remain unknown. Labrador Retrievers are one of the breeds that are prone to obesity. The purpose of this study was to analyse 41 canine orthologues of human genes linked to monogenic obesity in humans to identify genes associated with body weight in Labrador Retriever dogs. We analysed 11,520 variants from 50 dogs using a linear mixed model with sex, age, and sterilization as covariates and population structure as a random effect. Estimates obtained from the model were subjected to a maxT permutation procedure to adjust p-values for FWER &lt; 0.05. Only the ADCY3 gene showed statistically significant association: TA&gt;T deletion located at 17:19,222,459 in 1/20 intron (per allele effect of 5.56 kg, SE 0.018, p-value = 5.83 &#215; 10[-5], TA/TA: 11 dogs; TA/T: 32 dogs; T/T: 7 dogs). Mutations in the ADCY3 gene have already been associated with obesity in mice and humans, making it a promising marker for canine obesity research. Our results provide further evidence that the genetic makeup of obesity in Labrador Retriever dogs contains genes with large effect sizes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It has been used in human medicine and is a promising candidate for treating infections in veterinary medicine. Different Fosfomycin salts exhibit various degrees of bioavailability. Tromethamine salt is the most commonly used oral form due to its improved bioavailability. However, information regarding its use with dogs is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of oral Fosfomycin tromethamine in canine plasma and urine using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Six healthy male beagles underwent a three-period three-treatment study: treatment 1 and 2 with single oral Fosfomycin tromethamine at 40 and 80 mg/kg (the total doses with tromethamine salt were 75 and 150 mg/kg, respectively), and treatment 3 with intravenously Fosfomycin disodium at 57 mg/kg (the total dose with disodium salt was 75 mg/kg). Dogs receiving oral Fosfomycin tromethamine at 75 and 150 mg/kg, maximal drug concentration (Cmax) in plasma produced results of 34.46 &#177; 12.52 and 66.40 &#177; 12.64 &#181;g/mL, oral bioavailability (F) was approximately 38 and 45%, while urine Cmax was 4463.07 &#177; 2208.88 and 8784.93 &#177; 2303.46 &#181;g/mL, respectively. No serious adverse effects were reported, except loose stool in some dogs. The tremendously high urine Fosfomycin concentrations indicate that oral Fosfomycin tromethamine is suitable as an alternative treatment for bacterial cystitis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

STT and IOP values have been poorly described for sheep. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the normal range for STT and tonometry values in clinically normal Latvian Darkhead lambs and ewes. Both eyes of 100 sheep (200 eyes)-50 lambs (1-3 months old) and 50 ewes (1-8 years old)-underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including STT and IOP evaluation. The mean &#177; standard deviation of STT values for both eyes in lambs and ewes were 13.12 &#177; 3.91 mm/min and 13.68 &#177; 4.09 mm/min, respectively. The IOP in lambs and ewes was 14.04 &#177; 3.68 mmHg and 19.16 &#177; 3.24 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the suggested reference range for the STT was 12.00-14.23 mm/min in lambs and 12.52-14.84 mm/min in ewes, while the reference IOP range was determined to be 13.00-15.08 mmHg in lambs and 18.24-20.08 mmHg in ewes. No statistically significant differences in STT and IOP values were observed for both eyes. However, the IOP value for both eyes was statistically significantly higher in ewes compared to lambs (p &lt; 0.01). This study provides reference values for the STT and IOP in healthy Latvian Darkhead lambs and ewes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While the need for feeds rich in protein is constantly increasing, their production cannot readily keep up. Consequently, to overcome this challenge in a sustainable way, it is necessary to identify and develop new feeding strategies and feed ingredients, such as insect meals. In the present study, Tenebrio molitor larvae that were reared on two different substrates (standard and enriched with medicinal aromatic plant material) were used as feed ingredients for growing pigs. A total of 36 weaned pigs (34 days old) were randomly allocated to three treatment groups and fed either the control diet (A) or diets supplemented at 10% with one of the two insect meals (B and C). At the end of the trial (42 days), blood, feces, and meat samples were collected for analysis. The insect meal supplementation did not affect (p &gt; 0.05) overall performance but significantly modified (p &lt; 0.001) the fecal microflora balance and the blood cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), while the rest of the blood parameters tested were not affected. Moreover, this dietary supplementation significantly affected some microbial populations (p &lt; 0.001), improved the total phenolic content (p &lt; 0.05), and the fatty acid profile (p &lt; 0.001) of the meat cuts, but did not affect (p &gt; 0.05) meat color or proximate composition.

Flowers' Antioxidant Properties and Antibacterial Activities against Different Staphylococcus Species Associated with Bovine Mastitis.</Title>	<Abstract>Mastitis is one of the most considerable and costly diseases for dairy herds, and Staphylococcus spp. is known to be the main causative agent. Although antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of mastitis, this can cause both antibiotic residues in milk and the risk of antibiotic resistance occurrence in bacteria. Thus, in recent years, researchers have focused on alternative treatments for this disease and plants extracts are investigated for this purpose. Pomegranate is widely used as a dye, ornament, and medicinal plants in the industry, and the species has a particularly high economic value in Turkey. This study aims to investigate in vitro the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the pomegranate flower's extracts against different Staphylococcus species associated with bovine mastitis. To this aim, pomegranate flowers were collected from different regions in Turkey and extracts were prepared with three different solvents (methanol, ethanol, and water). The retention factor values of the ethanol extract were determined by thin-layer chromatography. The antibacterial activity tests were carried out via the disk diffusion method. In addition, the extracts were tested against the stable DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) free radicals for antioxidant activity. Four retention factors (0.79, 0.67, 0.58, and 0.33 points) were found for the ethanol extract. The methanol extract showed the highest inhibition zones against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus-37 (CNS-37) and S. aureus-18. The lowest MIC was 6500 &#956;g/mL. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in methanol extracts. As a result, the extracts of pomegranate flowers showed a high antioxidant and antibacterial potential against the examined mastitis pathogens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to present treatment options for dogs requiring cholecystectomy by reporting the pros and cons of 121 cholecystectomies performed via transverse incision at our hospital over 10 years. In most included cases, nonelective cholecystectomy was performed in an unstable emergency situation. The perioperative mortality rate was 23.14%, which was not significantly different from that of cholecystectomy performed via the conventional midline approach. However, the overall operation time (46.24 &#177; 6.13 min; range 35-65 min) was shortened by securing an adequate surgical field of view. The transverse incision approach facilitates fast and accurate surgery without increasing the fatality rate in small-breed dogs, in whom securing an adequate surgical field of view is difficult. Thus, transverse incision should be actively considered in dogs undergoing cholecystectomy due to emergency conditions, such as bile leakage or biliary tract obstruction, since prolonged anesthesia can be burdensome. This study may improve cholecystectomy outcomes in small-breed dogs with difficult-to-secure surgical fields.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The palpation method for detecting warble flies generally neglects the infestation intensity; therefore, the development of a reliable and efficient diagnostic technique is extremely necessary. This study compared three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods for detecting anti-P. silenus antibodies using the hypodermin C (HyC) purified from Hypoderma spp. Larvae collected in cattle (local isolate, Microbiology Laboratory, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi), the crude antigen from the first instar stage of P. silenus, and a commercial Bovine Hypodermosis Antibody ELISA kit (IDEXX Laboratory), for accurately estimating the seroprevalence of goat warble fly infestation (GWFI) in the Pothwar plateau, Punjab, Pakistan. The ELISA with the crude antigen of P. silenus proved very sensitive and specific, 91% and 93%, respectively. The optical density exhibited a monthly variation, and the antibody titer began increasing from June, continually increased from July to December, and gradually decreased thereafter until March. The study confirmed the endemic status of GWFI in the Pothwar region and identified that ELISA based on the crude antigen of P. silenus was a more sensitive and specific immunodiagnostic method for determining seroprevalence, and could be employed for initiating nationwide eradication campaigns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cow was recumbent during physical examination, and neurological examination revealed depression, absence of left eyelid and auricular motor reflex, and hypotonic tongue. Hematology revealed hemoconcentration, leukocytosis by neutrophilia, and hyperfibrinogenemia. Cerebrospinal fluid was slightly turbid, and presented polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, and hyperproteinorrachia. Grossly, the skull floor showed a purulent green-yellow exudate that drained from the left inner ear to the cisterna magna. There was diffuse congestion of the telencephalon, and meninges showed severe hyperemia, moderate thickening, and opacity with the deposition of fibrinosuppurative material ventrally, extending to the cerebellum and brainstem. The left cerebellar hemisphere showed an approximately 1.5 cm in diameter liquefaction area surrounded by a hemorrhagic halo. Histologically, cerebellar, mesencephalic, thalamic, and brain base meninges were intensely thickened and showed severe suppurative inflammation and fibrin deposition. Small multifocal suppurative areas were observed in the cerebellum and brainstem, characterized by a necrotic core, a number of neutrophils, and Gram-negative intralesional bacillary myriads. Pure cultures of P. aeruginosa were obtained and identified in the suppurative CNS lesions, meninges, and inner ear samples. This report highlights an uncommon clinical evolution of secondary P. aeruginosa suppurative meningoencephalitis, probably triggered by recurrent parasitic otitis in an adult Gir cow. Veterinarians, practitioners, and farmers must be aware of the risk of CNS infections after unresolved media and inner otitis, especially in cattle breeds more prone to developing parasitic otitis, such as the Gir and Indubrasil breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Whole blood was obtained at the scheduled time points after a single dose administration and cyclosporine was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technology (UPLC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the WinNonlin 8.3.4 software via compartmental and non-compartmental models. As a result, the bioavailability values for the low, medium, and high oral groups were 14.64%, 36.98%, and 13.53%, respectively. The nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile was observed in the range from 3.5 mg/kg to 14 mg/kg in cats following oral administration. Whole blood concentrations taken 4 h after oral administration were better correlated with the area under the blood concentration-time curve AUC0-24 with a high regression coefficient (R[2] = 0.896). This concentration would be a greater predictor in the following therapeutic drug monitoring. No adverse effect was observed in the whole study process.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37368786</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effectiveness Evaluation of Viti's vinifera Leaf Extract on the Viability of Echinococcus Eggs and Protoscolices In Vitro.</Title>	<Abstract>Echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the genus Echinococcus. Globally, it is one of the most central helminthic diseases. Surgery remains the method of choice to remove cystic Echinococcus. Various sporicidal agents have been used to invalidate the substances in hydatid cysts. Nevertheless, many sporicidal agents cause inflammation and can cause side complications, so their use should be limited. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Vitis vinifera leaf methanolic extract as a sporicidal agent for Echinococcus eggs and protoscolices and determines the best concentration. The mortality and viability of protoscolices were measured in samples exposed to four concentrations of V. vinifera leaf extract (VVLE) (5, 10, 30, and 50 mg/mL) for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min and in eggs exposed to three concentrations (100, 200, and 300 mg/mL) for 24 and 48 h. An infrared spectroscopy chemical test was conducted to assess the presence of numerous expected active components in the extract. The viability of eggs and protoscolices was confirmed using 0.1% eosin staining. Vinifera leaf extract exhibited the decisive sporicidal effect at 100%, 91%, 60%, and 41% after 30 min at concentrations of 50, 30, 10, and 5 mg/mL, and in eggs at 11% and 19% after 24 and 48 h at a concentration of 200 mg/mL, respectively. Increased incubation times and higher dosages often increase mortality. The results exhibited that V. vinifera is effective. This study confirmed that grape leaf extract has high sporicidal activity in vitro. However, more studies are required to determine the exact active chemical and its action mechanism and perform in vivo utilization to confirm these results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fish received a 20 mg/kg oral dose of doxycycline after a single or 5-day administration. Six rainbow trout were used at each sampling time point for plasma and tissue samples, including liver, kidney, and muscle and skin. The doxycycline concentration in the samples was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector. The pharmacokinetic data were evaluated by non-compartmental kinetic analysis. The WT 1.4 software program was used to estimate the withdrawal times. The increase of temperature from 10 to 17 &#176;C shortened the elimination half-life from 41.72 to 28.87 h, increased the area under the concentration-time curve from 173.23 to 240.96 h * &#956;g/mL, and increased the peak plasma concentration from 3.48 to 5.50 &#956;g/mL. At 10 and 17 &#176;C, the doxycycline concentration was obtained in liver &gt; kidney &gt; plasma &gt; muscle and skin. According to the MRL values stated for muscle and skin in Europe and China (100 &#956;g/kg) and in Japan (50 &#956;g/kg), the withdrawal times of doxycycline at 10 and 17 &#176;C were 35 and 31 days, respectively, for Europe and China and 43 and 35 days, respectively, for Japan. Since temperature significantly affected pharmacokinetic behavior and withdrawal times of doxycycline in rainbow trout, temperature-dependent dosing regimens and withdrawal times of doxycycline might be necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, a sensitive and rapid detection method which can differentially detect these viruses that lead to mixed infections in clinical cases, is urgently needed. According to the conserved regions of the PEDV M gene, TGEV S gene, and PDCoV N gene, and the reference gene of porcine (&#946;-Actin), we designed new specific primers and probes for the multiplex qPCR assay capable of simultaneously detecting three RNA viruses. This method, with a great specificity, did not cross-react with the common porcine virus. Moreover, the limit of detection of the method we developed could reach 10 copies/&#956;L ,and the intra- and inter-group coefficients of variation of it below 3%. Applying this assay to detect 462 clinical samples which were collected in 2022-2023, indicated that the discrete positive rates of PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV were 19.70%, 0.87%, and 10.17%, respectively. The mixed infection rates of PEDV/TGEV, PEDV/PDCoV, TGEV/PDCoV, and PEDV/TGEV/PDCoV were 3.25%, 23.16%, 0.22%, and 11.90%, respectively. All in all, the multiplex qPCR assay we developed as a tool for differential and rapid diagnosing can be put on the active prevention and control of PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV, , which can create great value in the diagnosis of swine diarrhea diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we quantified the intratumoral GAM density of low- and high-grade oligodendrogliomas compared to that of a normal brain, as well as the intratumoral concentration of several known GAM-derived pro-tumorigenic molecules in high-grade oligodendrogliomas compared to that in a normal brain. Our analysis demonstrated marked intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of GAM infiltration. Correspondingly, we observed significant variability in the intratumoral concentrations of several GAM-associated molecules, unlike what we previously observed in high-grade astrocytomas. However, high-grade oligodendroglioma tumor homogenates (n = 6) exhibited an increase in the pro-tumorigenic molecules hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as we observed in high-grade astrocytomas. Moreover, neoplastic oligodendrocytes displayed robust expression of GAL-3, a chimeric galectin implicated in driving immunosuppression in human glioblastoma. While this work identifies shared putative therapeutic targets across canine glioma subtypes (HGFR, GAL-3), it highlights several key differences in the immune landscape. Therefore, a continued effort to develop a comprehensive understanding of the immune microenvironment within each subtype is necessary to inform therapeutic strategies going forward.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Paramyxovirus was isolated from the diseased birds. Based on the nucleotide sequences of the F and NP gene fragments, it was determined that the virus belonged to subgenotype VII.1 AAvV-1 class II. The cleavage site of the F gene 109SGGRRQKRFIG119 and T in 546 and 555 position of the NP gene were typical for the velogenic type. The genetically closest NDV isolates were found in Iran. The mean time of death of 10-day-old chicken embryos upon infection with the minimal infectious dose was 52 h, which is typical for the velogenic pathotype. The virus caused 100% death of six-week-old chickens during oral infection as well as 100% mortality of all contact chickens, including those located in remote cages, which proves the ability of the virus to spread not only by the fecal-oral route but also by the aerosol route. That demonstrates a high level of pathogenicity and contagiousness of the isolated strain for chicken. However, mice intranasally infected with high doses of the virus did not die.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An online questionnaire based on a Likert scale score (1-10) was designed to assess items related to dog QoL, owner QoL, and the owner-dog relationship. Responses from 110 dog owners (30 with IBD and 80 healthy dogs) were included in the study. IBD dogs had significantly lower overall QoL (p &lt; 0.001), health (p &lt; 0.0001), and level of activity (p = 0.049). Owners of dogs with IBD reported lower overall QoL (p &lt; 0.001). The scores for how their dog's QoL might affect their own QoL (p = 0.028), how much their dog limited their social life, leisure time, or daily activities (p = 0.015), and how often they felt burdened by caring for their dog (p = 0.006) were significantly higher in the IBD group when compared to the healthy group. In addition, IBD dog owners were more likely to see their dogs as children (p = 0.0004). IBD has a negative impact on affected dogs and their owners regardless of the severity of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505812</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Development of Yorkshire Terrier Dentition.</Title>	<Abstract>The development of dentition in dogs has been associated with several problems including tooth over-crowding, missing permanent dentition, and persistent deciduous teeth (PDT). Information on dentition development in different breeds is lacking. This study of 61 Yorkshire terriers aimed to determine the (i) average age at deciduous tooth exfoliation, (ii) average age at permanent tooth eruption, (iii) PDT incidence, and influencing factors such as body weight. The ages of exfoliation of deciduous teeth and eruption of permanent dentition were influenced by body weight and tooth type. These dentition changes tended to occur later in dogs &#8804; 3 kg versus dogs &gt; 5 kg. Generally, incisors were exfoliated first, followed by premolars and then canines. At a body weight of 4.5 kg, the middle of the data range, the estimated age at loss of deciduous teeth (with 95% confidence intervals) was 21.9 (21.1, 22.9) weeks for incisors, 26.1 (24.9, 27.4) weeks for canines, and 23.9 (22.9, 24.9) weeks for premolar. The estimated age at eruption of permanent dentition was 22.3 (21.6, 23.0) weeks for incisors, 23.8 (23.0, 24.6) weeks for canines, 24.7 (24.0, 25.5) weeks for premolars, and 26.4 (25.5, 27.3) for molar teeth. However, this sequence was disrupted in dogs &#8804; 3 kg. Yorkshire terriers had a high incidence of PDT. At a body weight of 4.5 kg, the estimated proportion of PDT was: incisors 0.86% (0.32, 2.31), canines 15.62% (7.62, 29.37) and premolars 3.57% (1.62, 7.66). Canines constituted the most frequently retained tooth type, with 89.1% retained in dogs &#8804; 3 kg compared to 12.0% in dogs &gt; 5 kg. This information will enable veterinarians to provide personalised advice regarding the oral care requirements for Yorkshire terriers and highlights the need to regularly monitor this breed between the ages of two and seven months, during the active phases of tooth development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Stifle joint arthrodesis (SJA) was performed on the patient's right leg using autologous bone-grafting techniques. The right femur and tibial joint were angled 120-130&#176;, and an SJA plate was fixed on the front of the two bones. After performing joint fusion of the right limb, medial-patellar-luxation-(MPL)-corrective surgery was performed to cut the tibial tuberosity on the left leg, and the fixing force was increased using the figure-of-eight-tension-band-wiring technique. Results were recorded regarding the dog's ability to walk and trot in the right hind limb; these results were evaluated for 27 days after surgery. It was difficult for the patient to walk because weight-bearing had not been carried out for 3 days after the surgery; short strides and partial weight bearing were possible 5 to 7 days after surgery. After 10 days, the patient was able to move while bearing weight with a slight disruption. With regard to trotting, the patient showed intermittent normal steps 5 to 7 days after surgery, but the disruption continued. After 14 days, trotting was possible, and it was observed that movement could be maintained during everyday activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was studied in embryo-transferred (ET) Japanese Black cattle. ISGs in PBLs-ISG15, MX1, MX2, and OAS1-were detected in multiple ovulation ET cattle using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Gestational status was predicted using the average ISG levels during the normal estrous cycle (AVE) and the Youden index from the ROC curve analysis as cutoff values. The ISG15, MX1, and MX2 levels were significantly higher in pregnant cattle (n = 10) than in non-pregnant cattle (n = 23) on gestation day 21, whereas the levels of all ISGs were similar between non-pregnant and non-pregnant cattle with late embryonic death (n = 7). ISG15, MX1, and MX2 appropriately predicted the gestational status of ET cows. The statistical evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy in ET cows on day 21 of gestation presented higher values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive values of ISG15, MX1, and MX2 using the Youden index than using the AVE. Therefore, ISG15, MX1, and MX2 are excellent biomarkers of gestational status during the peri-implantation period in ET cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to explore factors within the vet-farmer relationship that may impact on biosecurity being carried out on cattle farms in England. Interviews were conducted with cattle farmers and large-animal vets, with a focus on individuals deemed to implement good levels of biosecurity or those working with said individuals. The questions explored how each stakeholder felt the communication occurred between the groups and the perceived consequential influence each had on the other. Inductive Thematic analysis was used to explore participants' experience of vet-farmer interactions with a focus on areas of reciprocity between the two groups. Five primary themes were identified. Factors within the vet-cattle farmer relationship, such as trust and familiarity, which were interconnected with time spent with each other, appeared to influence the uptake of biosecurity measures on cattle farms. These factors purportedly impacted the ability of vet-farmer pairs to have cooperative discussions and enter into shared decision-making. In order to enhance animal and human health and welfare, these relationship factors might be key to the development of sustainable optimisation frameworks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505817</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Antimicrobial Efficacy of Phyto-L, Thiosulfonate from Allium spp. Containing Supplement, against Escherichia Coli Strains from Rabbits.</Title>	<Abstract>Colibacillosis, caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), is one of the most common diseases in rabbit farms, resulting in economic losses due to mortality and decrease in production. Until recently, antimicrobials were used to both treat and prevent disease on livestock farms, leading to the possible risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Therefore, interest in alternative control methods, such as the use of natural substances, has increased in the scientific community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of Phyto-L (Pro Tech s.r.l.), a product containing organosulfur compounds (OSCs) such as propyl propane thiosulfonate (PTSO) from Allium spp., against 108 strains of E. coli isolated from rabbits with colibacillosis from 19 farms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Phyto-L were assessed. Bacterial suspensions with a charge of 10[8] CFU/mL, corresponding to those found in the rabbit gut under pathologic conditions, were tested with different concentrations from 20 to 0.15 &#956;L/mL of Phyto-L. For each strain, the MIC and concentrations above the MIC were plated on Tryptic Soy agar (TSA) without Phyto-L to assess the MBCs. MIC and MBC values ranged from 1.25 to 5 &#956;L/mL and 1.25 to 20 &#956;L/mL, respectively, depending on the strain tested. The data showed an interesting antibacterial activity of Phyto-L against EPEC strains. Therefore, this product could be effective in preventing colibacillosis in field application, especially considering that 10[4]-10[5] CFU/g of feces is the amount of E. coli usually found in the gut contents of rabbits under physiological condition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Aging is not a disease, but a combination of changes negatively affecting the organism in general and the immune system in particular, resulting in a decline in protection over time. The aim of this study was to measure the specific serum antibody titers against the main dangerous and widespread viral diseases preventable by core vaccinations in senior and geriatric dogs using the in-practice test VacciCheck. A cohort of three hundred fifty elderly dogs was analyzed for Protective Antibody Titers (PATs) against CPV-2, CDV and CAdV-1. The age ranged from 5 to 19 years, with two hundred fifty-eight seniors (73.7%) and ninety-two geriatrics (26.3%), and 97.4% of them were vaccinated at least once in their lives. More than half of the entire study population (52.9%) had PATs simultaneously for all three diseases, with 80.5% seniors and 19.5% geriatrics. Specific PATs were found in 88.6% of aging dogs for CPV-2, 82.3% for CadV-1 and 66.0% for CDV, demonstrating that unprotected aging dogs represent a minority. Unexpectedly, the larger elderly dogs resulted as more protected than smaller ones for CPV-2. Protection then decreases over time, with geriatric dogs less protected than senior ones. Veterinary practitioners should therefore always consider whether to maintain core vaccinations in aging dogs as in adults on a three-year basis or opt instead for closer boosters (every 1 or 2 years). PATs for core vaccines could then represent a good biomarker of protection and their titration could become a standard of care, especially in such a sensitive period of the dogs' life.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The new strains were designated as BVDV TJ2101, TJ2102, TJ2103, TJ2104, TJ2105, TJ2106, TJ2107, TJ2108 and TJ2109. The TJ2102 and TJ2104 strains were found to be cytopathic BVDV, and the other strains were non-cytopathic BVDV. An alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the new isolates share 92.2-96.3% homology with the CP7 strain and, thus, were classified as the BVDV-1b subgenotype. A recombination analysis of the genome sequences showed that the new strains could be recombined by the major parent BVDV-1a NADL strain and the minor parent BVDV-1m SD-15 strain. Some genome variations or unique amino acid mutations were found in 5'-UTR, E0 and E2 of these new isolates. In addition, a potential linear B cell epitopes prediction showed that the potential linear B cell epitope at positions 56-61 is highly variable in BVDV-1b. In conclusion, the present study has identified nine strains of BVDV from persistently infected cattle in China. Further studies on the virulence and pathogenesis of these new strains are recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We demonstrated that PIV5 was detectable in both serum and pooled organs at an average positive rate of 1.78% (99/5566). Among these, the complete genome sequence of 15,246 nucleotides was obtained for 12 field strains. Three out of the 12 strains had the lowest genetic identity (96.20-96.68%) among the 21 porcine PIV5 genomes collected in Germany, China, India, and Republic of Korea from 1998 to 2017. By analyzing a large collection of complete genome sequences of the structural protein-coding F and HN genes, this study proposed a classification of PIV5 into two lineages, 1 and 2, and identified that group 2.2.2 within sub-lineage 2.2 was substantially divergent. The evolution of two structural protein-coding genes was largely under purifying selection. A few codons (6/9 for the F gene, 7/8 for the HN gene) had elevated dN/dS values, which were loaded on internal branches and were predicted to be related to beneficial trait(s) of the virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the value of using the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) for the detection of anti-erythrocytic autoantibodies in serum from dogs suspected of having IMHA is unclear. To evaluate the IAT, leftover serum samples from a large cohort of 94 dogs suspected of having IMHA and for which DAT results were known were incubated with DAT- erythrocytes, and five IAT techniques were performed (in part with different reagents and temperatures): microtiter plate (MICRO), microcapillary, laboratory gel column, gel minitube kit (GEL KIT), and immunochromatographic strip kit. Two IAT techniques (MICRO at 37 &#176;C and GEL KIT with rabbit anti-dog polyvalent reagent) detected autoantibodies against erythrocytes in serum from 53% and 57% of DAT+ dogs, respectively, while other IATs performed less well. Moreover, while the analytic specificity of the IAT methods compared to the DAT ranged from 96-100%, the sensitivity range was only 9-57%. Thus, we still recommend DAT for diagnosis and monitoring of IMHA in dogs but conclude that a positive IAT result may aid diagnostically when serum is available, but fresh red blood cells are not.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To achieve this, fish were sampled at various intervals using a sparse sampling strategy, and plasma samples were analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Subsequently, na&#239;ve average data were analyzed using a non-compartmental method, and a population model was developed based on the nonlinear mixed effects approach. The covariate of BW and the relationship between covariances were sequentially incorporated into the population model. However, it was found that only covariance and not BW affected the population parameters. Therefore, the covariance model was taken as the final population model, which revealed that the typical values of the absorption rate constant (tvKa), apparent volume of distribution per bioavailability (tvV), and clearance rate per bioavailability (tvCl) were 1.18 1/h, 14.18 L/kg, and 0.20 L/h/kg, respectively. Based on the calculated free AUC/MIC values, the current oral dose of difloxacin (20 mg/kg BW) cannot generate adequate plasma concentrations to inhibit pathogens with MIC values above 0.83 &#956;g/mL. Further study should be carried out to collect the pathogens from crucian carp and determine the MIC data of difloxacin against them. Pharmacodynamic experiments must also be further carried out to determine the optimal therapeutic dose for the treatment of Aeromonas hydrophila infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Histopathological intestinal samples from 97 dogs were included in the study (19 healthy juveniles, 21 healthy adults, 24 dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), and 33 CE dogs without PLE). Healthy adult small intestinal enterocytes showed progressively reduced epithelial cell height in the aboral direction, while juvenile dogs showed progressively increased epithelial cell height in the aboral direction. CE dogs had increased epithelial cell height in the duodenum, while PLE dogs had decreased epithelial cell heights compared to healthy adult dogs. Both the CE and PLE dogs showed decreased enterocyte width in the duodenal segment, and the ileal and colonic enterocytes of CE dogs were narrower than those of healthy adult dogs. CE dogs had a lower goblet cell-to-enterocyte ratio in the colon segment compared to healthy dogs. This study provides valuable morphometric information on enterocytes during canine chronic enteropathies, highlighting significant morphological enterocyte alterations, particularly in the small intestine, as well as a reduced goblet cell-to-enterocyte ratio in the colon of CE cases compared to healthy adult dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The visibility, density, enhancement, grade, size, volume, shape, borders and lateralization of the thymus were evaluated and statistical analysis was performed. The effect of obesity on thymic grade and volume was also investigated.</Abstract><Abstract>The visibility, density, dorsal length, volume and grade decreased with increasing age. The thymic shape and lateralization were mostly wedge shaped and left sided, respectively. The borders became concave with aging and increasing body fat content caused an increase in the fatty degeneration of the thymus.</Abstract><Abstract>Declining thymic density, grade, size and volume with aging are related to thymic involution and fatty degeneration was accelerated by increasing body fat content. Females and males were different only in thymic shape and small and large breeds were different only in thymic volume. The thymus was visible in some geriatric dogs with no underlying disease. We expect that the present work can be used by radiologists in reading thoracic computed tomography but investigation of thymic characteristics in dogs with neoplasia and history of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and thoracic surgeries can complete this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Intestinally expressed calprotectin (S100A8/A9 protein complex) appears to be part of the complex pathogenesis of feline chronic enteropathies (FCE). Fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive biomarker for intestinal inflammation in humans and dogs but has not yet been evaluated in cats. We hypothesized that fecal calprotectin (fCal) concentrations are increased in FCE, correlate with clinical and/or histologic disease severity, and distinguish cases of CIE from SCL. This case-control study included fecal samples and patient data from cats with CIE (n = 34), SCL (n = 17), other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (n = 16), and cats with no clinical signs of GI disease (n = 32). fCal concentrations were measured using the immunoturbidimetric fCal turbo assay (B&#252;hlmann Laboratories). Compared to healthy cats, fCal concentrations were significantly increased in CIE, SCL, and other diseases (all p &lt; 0.0001), but were not different between these three groups (all p &gt; 0.05), or between cats with extra-GI diseases and healthy controls. These findings suggest that fCal may have utility as a clinical biomarker for FCE but not for intestinal disease differentiation. It further supports the role of calprotectin in the pathogenesis of the spectrum of FCE, which includes CIE and SCL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main objectives of this study in larvae of the Galleria mellonella moth were therefore to compare the virulence of eight bovine STEC and EPEC O80:H2, of two E. coli pS88 plasmid transconjugant and STX2d phage transductant K12 DH10B, of four E. coli O80:non-H2, and of the laboratory E. coli K12 DH10B strains. Thirty larvae per strain were inoculated in the last proleg with 10 &#956;L of tenfold dilutions of each bacterial culture corresponding to 10 to 10[6] colony-forming units (CFUs). The larvae were kept at 37 &#176;C and their mortality rate was followed daily for four days. The main results were that: (i) not only the STEC and EPEC O80:H2, but also different E. coli O80:non-H2 were lethal for the larvae at high concentrations (from 10[4] to 10[6] CFU) with some variation according to the strain; (ii) the Stx2d toxin and partially the pS88 plasmid were responsible for the lethality caused by the E. coli O80:H2; (iii) the virulence factors of E. coli O80:non-H2 were not identified. The general conclusions are that, although the Galleria mellonella larvae represent a useful first-line model to study the virulence of bacterial pathogens, they are more limited in identifying their actual virulence properties.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505827</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Green Turtle Fibropapillomatosis: Tumor Morphology and Growth Rate in a Rehabilitation Setting.</Title>	<Abstract>Fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a neoplastic disease most often found in green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Afflicted turtles are burdened with potentially debilitating tumors concentrated externally on the soft tissues, plastron, and eyes and internally on the lungs, kidneys, and the heart. Clinical signs occur at various levels, ranging from mild disease to severe debilitation. Tumors can both progress and regress in affected turtles, with outcomes ranging from death due to the disease to complete regression. Since its official description in the scientific literature in 1938, tumor growth rates have been rarely documented. In addition, FP tumors come in two very different morphologies; yet, to our knowledge, there have been no quantified differences in growth rates between tumor types. FP tumors are often rugose in texture, with a polypoid to papillomatous morphology, and may or may not be pedunculated. In other cases, tumors are smooth, with a skin-like surface texture and little to no papillose structures. In our study, we assessed growth-rate differences between rugose and smooth tumor morphologies in a rehabilitation setting. We measured average biweekly tumor growth over time in green turtles undergoing rehabilitation at the University of Florida Whitney Laboratory Sea Turtle Hospital in St. Augustine, Florida, and compared growth between rugose and smooth tumors. Our results demonstrate that both rugose and smooth tumors follow a similar active growth progression pattern, but rugose tumors grew at significantly faster rates (p = 0.013) than smooth ones. We also documented regression across several examined tumors, ranging from -0.19% up to -10.8% average biweekly negative growth. Our study offers a first-ever assessment of differential growth between tumor morphologies and an additional diagnostic feature that may lead to a more comprehensive understanding and treatment of the disease. We support the importance of tumor morphological categorization (rugose versus smooth) being documented in future FP hospital- and field-based health assessments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fresh fish is highly perishable and may be consumed raw, such as salmon in sushi. This work aims to identify strategies to improve the shelf-life and safety of fresh salmon, using available methods (i.e., vacuum) and exploring the use of natural preservatives (i.e., seasonings). Vacuum packaging and good hygiene practices (which reduce initial flora) extended shelf-life up to 20 days. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was dominant in vacuum packaging conditions and showed potential for inhibiting Listeria monocytogenes. For natural preservatives, L. monocytogenes required higher inhibitory concentrations in vitro when compared to the 10 spoilage bacteria isolated from fresh salmon fillets, presenting a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.13% for oregano essential oil (OEO), 10% for lemon juice, 50 mg mL[-1] for garlic powder, and &gt;10% for NaCl. A good bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect was observed for a mixture containing 5% NaCl, 0.002% OEO, 2.5% lemon juice, and 0.08 mg mL[-1] garlic powder. Finally, using the salmon medium showed an adequate correlation with the commercial culture medium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-eight dogs were recruited and randomly allocated to the placebo (n = 19) and treatment groups (n = 19). The dogs were treated with mouth spray once daily for 42 days. The changes in the gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), and calculus index (CI) were measured at baseline (day 0) and end of the study (42nd day). The changes in the oral microbial composition of representative dogs (placebo, n = 7; and treatment, n = 7) were also evaluated at baseline and end of the study. Oral microbial composition was assessed by sequencing. The sequences were annotated using the QIIME 2.0[TM]. The GI, PI, and CI indexes were reduced after the GAMS usage. The abundance of the commensal bacterial phylum Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi, genera Frederiksenia, and Bergeyella was improved after six weeks of GAMS usage. GAMS reduced the pathogenic bacterial species, including Neisseria sp., Desulfobulbus sp., Capnocytophaga canis, and Corynebacterium mustelae. Moreover, some pathogenic bacterial abundances were increased at the end of the study. All the microbial variations were observed within the group. The inter-group analysis revealed that the changes were unrelated to GAMS usage. Further studies need to be carried out using more experimental subjects to confirm the effectiveness of GAMS. More metagenomic data are required to evidence the GMAS impact on the oral microbiome of healthy dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The marine lipid extract, EAB-277, is a natural anti-inflammatory nutraceutical product. However, the effects of EAB-277 in IMHA dogs has rarely been investigated. The objective of this study is to assess the clinical effects of EAB-277 and prednisolone dose-tapering for supplemental therapy in IMHA dogs. Prednisolone was given to 18 anemic IMHA dogs according to a standard regimen. Six dogs were supplementally treated with EAB-277 for 28 days and the remaining twelve dogs were a control group of untreated supplementations. The results demonstrate that the supplement group showed slightly better survival rates (66.7 &#177; 19.2%) than the control group (16.7 &#177; 0.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.408). When compared to pre-therapy, the supplement group's blood profiles improved (p &lt; 0.05). The EAB-277 treated group showed a moderate decrease in the incidence rate (4.20 times) of prednisolone tapering compared to the control group. The dosage reduction of prednisolone in supplement group was more than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). Our results suggest that EAB-277 supplementation may enhance clinical outcomes and lessen prednisolone dose-tapering in canine IMHA therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data were collected through a survey-type investigation on a representative sample of the Italian population. Forty-five percent of the interviewees were aware that companion animals could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, 29.8% were familiar with preventive measures to adopt to avoid viral transmission between infected humans and companion animals, and only 20.7% knew which companion animals could be at risk of infection. Higher awareness regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animals and humans (51.7%) and the measures to prevent it (33.3%) was detected among companion animals' owners. Notably, 40.4% of interviewees were not informed at all. Television broadcasts (26.4%) represented the main source of information, while only 3.5% of the interviewees relied on veterinarians, of which 31.9% considered this source of information as the most trustworthy. Overall, 72.4% of Italians recognized that the communication campaign on COVID-19 and companion animals was inadequate. This survey highlights the need for increasing the public awareness of the risk of companion animals being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the involvement of professionals in the public communication on zoonoses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

From rrosive to ulcerative cutaneous lesions may seldom appear as a consequence of the copepod feeding on keratin on turtles' skin. Debilitating Turtle Syndrome (DTS) is the final outcome of a chronic insufficient assumption of nutrients, generally occurring with the impairment of immune functions and high epibiota burdens. In this survey, the presence of B. manatorum in C. caretta from the Northwestern Adriatic Sea was investigated and the relation between infection indices and the co-occurrence of DTS was studied. Clinical examination was performed at the time of rescue, including routine hematological assessment; external parasites were isolated mechanically from turtles' skin and morphologically identified through observation with an optic microscope and SEM. Ten turtles were classified as affected by DTS, all of them being small juveniles with typical clinical and clinicopathological presentation. A higher prevalence, abundance, and density of infection were found in turtles affected by the syndrome. The presence of massive skin coverage by the burrowing barnacle Pletylepas hexastylos prevented a proper evaluation of the pathology associated with B. manatorum in turtles affected by DTS. In any event, eventual skin damages caused by the parasite may represent a port of entry for secondary infections in such immunocompromised animals. Therefore, infection by B. manatorum should not go overlooked in debilitated turtles and should be opportunely treated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diagnosing pancreatitis in dogs is based on the integration of serum canine-specific pancreatic lipase (cPLI) concentration, clinical presentation, and diagnostic imaging findings. However, markers of systemic inflammation and antiprotease activity have not been extensively investigated in the characterization and prognostication of pancreatitis in dogs. Serum concentrations of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (&#945;1PI; as a marker of systemic antiprotease response) and calprotectin and S100A12 (as markers of systemic inflammation) were measured in serum samples from 35 Miniature Schnauzers diagnosed with pancreatitis (serum cPLI concentration &gt;400 &#956;g/L, clinical signs, abdominal imaging findings). These markers were evaluated for possible associations with patient characteristics, clinical presentation, risk factors for pancreatitis, and outcome. The study showed that biomarkers of systemic inflammation and antiprotease activity are commonly increased in Miniature Schnauzers with pancreatitis. Whereas serum calprotectin and S100A12 concentrations were found to have limited utility in differentiating pancreatitis presentations, serum &#945;1PI concentrations and potentially also the serum calprotectin-to-S100A12 ratio might be non-invasive surrogate markers of disease severity in dogs with pancreatitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifteen alpaca males with different ages (young (YM; ~12-14 mo.), n = 5; intermediate (IM; ~24 mo.), n = 5; and old (OM; &#8805;36 mo.), n = 5) were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were taken from each alpaca male and the circulating plasmatic testosterone concentration (TC; ng/mL) was determined using ELISA analysis. The testicular traits related to bio-morphometric parameters (the length (L), width (W), area (A), and volume (TV)) were assessed using B-mode ultrasonography. Pulse-wave/power Doppler ultrasonography was used to obtain the circulatory dynamic values (testicular hemodynamics) before the beginning of natural service mating. Significant differences were observed in TC among the age groups, increasing as the age of the males increased (2.47 &#177; 0.31, 8.45 &#177; 1.53, and 22.66 &#177; 2.15 for YM, IM, and OM, respectively; p &lt; 0.05); however, no differences were observed regarding the testicular B-mode ultrasonographic parameters (L, W, and A) (p &gt; 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between TV and testicular L, W, and A (r = 0.96, r = 0.95, and r = 0.96, respectively; p &#8804; 0.001). Pulse-wave-Doppler-derived parameters such as the pulsatility index (PI) and the resistive index (RI), as well as the total vascularity area (TVA) assessed by power Doppler, were similar in all of the age groups studied (p &gt; 0.05). General linear model (GLM) analysis showed a relationship between TC and TV (OR = 0.95; p = 0.04), as well as between TC and TVA (OR = 0.99; p= 0.02). Finally, no differences were observed regarding the pregnancy rate among the different age groups (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, TC increased as the age of the alpaca males increased. Although TC was related to TV and TVA, the pregnancy rates obtained from individuals belonging to the different age groups were similar, indicating that TC, TV, and TVA were not determining factors in assessing the potential age-related fertility differences in alpaca males.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There has been no report on PoSaV infection in Vietnam up to now. In this study, a total of 102 samples were collected from piglets, fattening pigs, and sows with diarrhea in several cities and provinces in northern Vietnam. The PoSaV genome was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences (324 bp) was performed. Of the 102 tested samples, 10 (9.8%) and 7/20 (35%) were detected as positive for the PoSaV RdRp gene using the PCR method at the individual and farm levels, respectively. Genetic analysis of the partial RdRp gene region of about 324 bp indicated that the nucleotide identity of the current 10 Vietnamese viral strains ranged from 61.39% to 100%. Among the 10 strains obtained, 8 belonged to genotype III and the remaining 2 strains were clustered in genotype VIII. The Vietnamese genotype III viruses formed two sub-clusters. The Vietnamese PoSaV strains were closely related to PoSaVs reported in South Korea, Venezuela, and the Netherlands. This research was the first to describe PoSaV infection in northern Vietnam during 2022-2023.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to induce T2DM in rats through a high-fat diet, followed by a single administration of low dose streptozotocin (STZ), and make an assessment of the development of the disease. The rats were divided into two groups-experimental and control-and were monitored for a period of 10 days. Changes in anthropometric parameters, glucose, insulin, lipids, uric acid, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), as well as the histological changes in the liver and pancreas, were recorded. To assess insulin resistance, we used the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta cell function (HOMA-&#946;) and visceral obesity-adiposity index (AI). The data demonstrate that the increasing values of glucose, HOMA-IR, AI, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, low- and very-low-density lipoproteins are important markers of the pre-diabetic state. The stable hyperglycemia and increased levels of TC, TG, VLDL, LDL, uric acid and AOPP in experimental rats strongly suggest the development of T2DM. HOMA-IR, HOMA-&#946;, AI, and uric acid are reliable criteria for T2DM in rats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We assessed the physiological parameters and the severity of diarrhea, as well as the changes in three serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), plasma diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactate (D-LA), and the fecal microbiome. Feeding B. subtilis HH2 significantly reduced the severity of diarrhea after the ETEC challenge (p &lt; 0.05) and increased serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM (p &lt; 0.01). B. subtilis HH2 administration also reduced serum levels of DAO at 48 h after the ETEC challenge (p &lt; 0.05), but no significant changes were observed in D-LA (p &gt; 0.05). Oral ETEC challenge significantly reduced the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in beagles not pre-fed with B. subtilis HH2 (p &lt; 0.05), while B. subtilis HH2 feeding and oral ETEC challenge significantly altered the gut microbiota structure of beagles (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, 14 days of B. subtilis HH2 feeding reduced the relative abundance of Deinococcus-Thermus in feces. This study reveals that B. subtilis HH2 alleviates diarrhea caused by ETEC, enhances non-specific immunity, reduces ETEC-induced damage to the intestinal mucosa, and regulates gut microbiota composition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty dogs were involved, and each was subjected to three different treatments with a 3-month gap: Chopin music, Mozart music, and no music, via loudspeakers. The dogs were premedicated with acepromazine and butorphanol by intramuscular injection, and anaesthesia was induced using propofol intravenously. To compare the depth of sedation and propofol requirements for the induction of anaesthesia among the different treatments, we utilized non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test) for the depth of sedation due to a slight deviation from the normal distribution and parametric (ANOVA) for propofol requirements. When exposed to music (Chopin or Mozart), dogs exhibited deeper sedation and required less propofol for their intubation compared to the no-music treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Exposure to classical music had a positive impact on the level of sedation, and more profound central nervous system depression seemed to contribute to approximately 20% lower propofol dose requirements for tracheal intubation. Therefore, classical music during the preoperative period appeared to exert a beneficial effect, at least when applying the specific pre-anaesthetic medications used in the present study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-nine four-week-old Golden Retriever puppies were randomly assigned to control (CG, n = 13) and treated (TG, n = 16) groups. During the whole experimental time, there were no differences between the groups with regard to average daily gain and faecal score. In TG, faecal calprotectin and zonulin values were statistically significantly decreased compared to CG, especially at week 8 (zonulin: 42.8 &#177; 1.54 ng/mL and 55.3 &#177; 42.8 ng/mL, and calprotectin: 2.91 &#177; 0.38 &#181;g/g and 5.71 &#177; 0.43 &#181;g/g, in TG and CG, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). Bacteria belonging to phylum Campylobacterota decreased (p = 0.04), while those referring to genera Coprococcus and Pseudomonas increased (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). The supplementation of the tested complementary feed can promote the intestinal health of puppies and therefore facilitate weaning by lowering gut inflammation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In particular, aggression can make interspecific coexistence quite complicated within family units, thus exposing all members to greater health risks. In this present study, we documented multiple aggression episodes against one of the two family members caused by a 4-year-old neutered male pure breed Lagotto Romagnolo dog. To minimize impulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors of the patient as much as possible and improve his relationship with the adopting family, we used an interdisciplinary approach, employing specific skilled personnel, including a veterinary behaviorist and a rehabilitating dog instructor. Nine months after fluoxetine treatment (0.8 mg/kg, SID), in combination with oral &#945;-s1 casozepine administration, and behavioral rehabilitation, the owners reported a significant reduction in aggressive events in terms of intensity and frequency. Collectively, our promising data pave the way toward a more detailed characterization of &#945;-s1-casozepine to better evaluate the potential involvement of such a compound in the modulation of aggressive behaviors in dogs affected by relational dysfunctions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to evaluate whether the Ki67 index has a predictive value in a homogeneous cohort of G2/LG cMCTs with HN2 lymph nodes (LNs) and to describe the clinical outcome. The second goal was to explore the correlation between the Ki67 index and MC. The medical databases of three institutions were retrospectively searched for dogs undergoing surgical treatment for cMCT and LN extirpation, with a histological diagnosis of G2/LG with HN2 LNs. Information about histological margins, MC, Ki67 index, local recurrence, nodal relapse, distant metastasis, de novo cMCT occurrence and date and cause of death were included. A total of 39 cases were identified. None of these developed local and nodal relapse or metastatic distant disease. Median MC was 1 (0-2). Median Ki67 index was 3.5 (0.7-14.3). Ki67 and MC were not significantly correlated. At the end of the study, 32 (82%) dogs were alive, 7 (18%) dogs were dead from unrelated causes and 4 (10.2%) dogs were lost to follow-up. The median ST was not reached, and the mean was 893 days (104-2241 days). Considering the strict inclusion criteria, dogs affected by G2/LG with HN2 LNs treated with surgery alone may have a good oncologic outcome; the Ki67 index does not have prognostic impact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on similar somatic cell counts and clinical symptoms, nine healthy dairy cows and nine cows with CM were selected, respectively. Blood samples were collected from cows with mastitis on the day of diagnosis. Cows with mastitis were injected with anemoside B4 (0.05 mL/kg, once daily) for three consecutive days, and healthy cows were injected with the same volume of normal saline. Subsequently, blood samples were collected. The plasma metabolic profiles were analyzed using untargeted mass spectrometry, and the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1&#946;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) in serum were evaluated via ELISA. The cows with CM showed increased concentrations of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; (p &lt; 0.05). After treatment with anemoside B4, the concentrations of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01). Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that choline, glycocholic acid, PC (18:0/18:1), 20-HETE, PGF3&#945;, and oleic acid were upregulated in cows with CM. After treatment with anemoside B4, the concentrations of PC (16:0/16:0), PC (18:0/18:1), linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, phosphorylcholine, and glycerophosphocholine were downregulated, while the LysoPC (14:0), LysoPC (18:0), LysoPC (18:1), and cis-9-palmitoleic acid were upregulated. This study indicated that anemoside B4 alleviated the inflammatory response in cows with CM mainly by regulating lipid metabolism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Through comprehensive examinations, the patient was tentatively diagnosed with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin (MUO) and treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside was started. The symptoms were improving with immunosuppressive treatment. However, severe bacterial cystitis occurred and we could not avoid tapering off prednisolone. Then, neurological signs recurred. Therefore, we added crisdesalazine, which allowed us to reduce the daily dosage of immunosuppressants easily. In another case, a 4-year-old, spayed female Yorkshire terrier dog (Case 2) was referred to our hospital showing a head tilt, circling, and loss of the menace reflex. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with MUO and treatment with some immunosuppressants was attempted. The clinical symptoms improved, but the alleviation was inadequate. Thus, we added crisdesalazine. The neurological signs then markedly improved. Moreover, the drugs could be tapered off more easily than before. Crisdesalazine is a novel drug that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action in brain disease and is used particularly for dementia. In this paper, we tried an off-label use of this drug in canine MUO patients, and found that it had, in these two patients, additional therapeutic effects on the MUO.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Many individual cases of this disease have been observed in clinical practice; however, familial transmission has not been demonstrated due to the difficulty in tracing the family members of household dogs, especially after the disease's onset in adulthood. Recently, we encountered two cases of GI polyposis in maternal half sisters. These two cases facilitated the identification of additional relatives spanning three generations, including parents, full and half siblings of the dam (aunt and uncle), littermate and non-littermate siblings, and a nephew. Genetic analysis revealed that 11 of the 14 examined JRTs in this family carried the heterozygous germline APC variant, and eight dogs with the variant already had a current and/or past medical history of GI neoplastic polyps. Some cases in the family showed significantly more severe disease phenotypes than those initially reported, suggesting that the severity of this disease can vary considerably among individuals. Moreover, familial aggregation of severe cases suggested that the genetic modifier involved in increasing severity may have been transmitted in this family in addition to the germline APC variant. Furthermore, in addition to this family, we reported two other families of JRTs affected by hereditary GI polyposis that consisted of five full and half siblings and a mother-daughter pair, respectively. These findings unequivocally establish the transgenerational transmission of hereditary GI polyposis associated with the germline APC variant in JRT lineages.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The virus has a high morbidity and fatality rate and is found all over the world. We created a novel FPV assay using nanoPCR technology and assessed the method's specificity and sensitivity. The approach amplified a 345 bp nucleic acid fragment with a minimum detection limit of 7.97 &#215; 10[2] copies/&#956;L, which is about 100 times greater than traditional PCR. We collected anal swabs from 83 cats suspected of FPV infection for practical application, and the FPV-positive rate determined by the nanoPCR approach was 77.1%. In conclusion, the approach is more sensitive than conventional PCR and more convenient and cost-effective than qPCR methodology and may be utilized for the clinical detection of FPV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Columnaris is prevalent during stressful events such as feed training and when fish are stocked at high densities in holding vats before sale. Kaolin clay was effective in laboratory trials as a treatment for columnaris in catfish. As a result, fish farmers are interested in applying kaolin products but were hesitant as they feared that the high doses of kaolin clay in vats might negatively affect the gills and overall health of fish. Therefore, we evaluated potential clay concentrations that might be used to prophylactically treat fish in vats. The effects of low to excessively high doses (0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 g/L) of kaolin clay (AkuaPro[TM], Imerys, GA, USA) were evaluated using a 72 h bioassay conducted in static tanks using Micropterus salmoides, Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Lepomis macrochirus, Ictalurus punctatus, Notemigonus crysoleucas, and Pimephales promelas. Results of these trials revealed a 100% survival rate across all six fish species exposed to kaolin clay at concentrations of up to 8 g/L for 48 h (followed by a 24 h recovery period in clean water) with no adverse effects to eyes, skin, gastrointestinal tract, or liver histology noted at any treatment. In addition, Micropterus salmoides analyzed for heavy metals due to exposure to the clay indicated that concentrations did not differ from control fish.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although horses were initially thought to be resistant to NTM infection, reports of horses suffering from gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive diseases associated with NTM have increased in the last few decades. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the mycobacteria species found in horses, describe clinical manifestations, diagnostic and treatment approaches, and public health concerns of NTM infection in horses. Clinical manifestations of NTM in horses include pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, soft tissue, bone infections, and disseminated disease. NTM are also linked to granulomatous enteritis, placentitis, and abortions. Currently, diagnostic methods for NTM are limited and include acid-fast microscopy, bacterial cultures, species-specific PCR assays, and gene sequencing. In humans, NTM treatment guidelines are available, but their application appears inadequate and inconsistent. In horses, treatment guidelines for NTM infections are not available. NTM are a serious public health threat as 70% of people with untreated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have a chronic pulmonary disease caused by NTM. Thus, it is essential that we gain a better understanding of NTM infections in horses and their zoonotic potential.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred and twenty-six pregnant Nellore cows (455.3 &#177; 8.1 kg) were allocated in three different nutritional treatments during pregnancy: NP-control, PP-protein-energy supplementation in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and FP-the same supplementation throughout pregnancy. After parturition, all cows and calves received the same environmental and nutrition condition. The body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), ribeye area (REA), backfat thickness (BFT), and rumpfat thickness (RFT) were collected on four occasions during pregnancy in the cows and from birth to finishing in calves. All data (cows and calves) were submitted to an analysis of variance (p &lt; 0.05) using a linear model (MIXED procedure; SAS software). The BW, RFT, and BCS from the cows showed significant differences in the middle third of pregnancy and pre-delivery and RFT postpartum (p &lt; 0.05). For the offspring, the weaning weight showed a tendency (NP lighter than others). In terms of gain, the PP group tended to be higher in RFT at calving (p = 0.06), in REA at finishing (p = 0.09), and in ADG in the same period (p = 0.09). The prenatal nutrition strategies had little or no effect on the beef cattle postnatal performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, the viral metagenomics of 22 groups of fecal samples from domestic cats revealed a high prevalence of feline anelloviruses (FcTTV) infection in domestic cats in Shanghai, China. Serum samples from 30 cat individuals were further detected by polymerase chain reaction, and an average positive rate of 36.67% (11/30) of FcTTV infection was found. Next, the full-length sequences of five Shanghai FcTTV variants were obtained and submitted to GenBank with access numbers OP186140 to OP186144. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Shanghai FcTTV variants have relatively consistent genomic characteristics, with two variants from Zhejiang 2019 and one variant from the Czech Republic 2010. The recombination event analysis of the variants showed that one variant (OP186141_SH-02) had a primary parental sequence derived from a variant (KM229764) from the Czech Republic in 2010, while the secondary parental sequence was derived from OP186140_SH-01. The results revealed that FcTTV infection is prevalent in domestic cats and that the use of viral metagenomics to rapidly identify some infecting viruses whose hosts lack clinical features would be an effective approach.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During eight weekly sessions, semen from three Merino rams was pooled, diluted with an egg-yolk-based semen extender, and divided into four groups: control, 1 mM MLT, 5 mM GSH, and 1 mM MLT + 5 mM GSH. Diluted semen was evaluated before and after the freezing process. The supplementation of diluted semen with GSH at 5 mM had a deleterious effect on total motility progressive (TPM), curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), average-path velocity (VAP), linearity (LIN), and straightness (STR) and increased slow spermatozoa (%). MLT at 1 mM also had a negative effect on TPM, VSL, and STR in diluted semen. In thawed semen, 1 mM MLT increased the TPM compared with the control group. VSL was lower in the 5 mM GSH group than in the 1 mM MLT group. Additionally, the combination of both antioxidants attenuated the negative effect of 5 mM GSH on TPM, VSL, and BCF. These results indicate that 5 mM GSH impairs or does not improve sperm kinetic parameters in either diluted or thawed semen. They also suggest that MLT combined with GSH plays a protective role against these effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

FVB/N female mice were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at 5 weeks of age: (1) a six-week subcutaneous injection of saline at 11 &#956;L/h (control-CON), or (2) a six-week subcutaneous injection of LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 at 0.1 &#956;g/g body weight at 11 &#956;L/h. At 106 weeks (i.e., 742 days) after the last treatment, mice were euthanized. Following euthanasia, liver and spleen samples were collected, snap frozen, and stored at -80 &#176;C until gene expression profiling. LPS upregulated nine genes in the liver, according to the findings (Pparg, Frs3, Kras, Raf1, Gsk3b, Rras2, Hk2, Pik3r2, and Myd88). With a 4.18-fold increase over the CON group, Pparg was the most up-regulated gene in the liver. Based on the annotation cluster analysis, LPS treatment upregulated liver genes which are involved in pathways associated with hepatic steatosis, B- and T-cell receptor signaling, chemokine signaling, as well as other types of cancers such as endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. LPS increased the spleen expression of Ccl11, Ccl25, Il6, Cxcl5, Pparg, Tlr4, Nos2, Cxcl11, Il1a, Ccl17, and Fcgr3, all of which are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses and the regulation of cytokine production. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways were the most enriched in LPS-treated mice spleen tissue. Our findings support the notion that early-life LPS exposure can result in long-term changes in gene expression profiling in the liver and spleen tissues of FVB/N female mice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To prevent the negative health effects of overweight, it is important to identify and treat canine overweight. Dog owners are essential for such interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate dog owners' perceptions of various canine body compositions via indirect assessment based on photos and direct assessment of their own dogs. A second aim was to evaluate the effect of a standardized practical education for dog owners on body condition score (BCS) assessment of their own dogs. The 9-point BCS scale was used, and two study samples were recruited: one was a survey sample where 564 dog owners assessed the BCS of dogs using photos, and one sample was a separate clinical sample where 82 dogs were assessed by their owners and by veterinary health care personnel. The initial BCS assessment by the dog owners in the clinical sample (mean &#177; SD) was significantly lower (4.6 &#177; 1.0) than the BCS assessed by the veterinary health care personnel (5.2 &#177; 1.1), but the owners improved significantly after receiving the standardized education (5.1 &#177; 1.0) (both p &lt; 0.0001) and performed as accurately as the veterinary health care personnel (p = 0.99). The results should be verified in the broader dog owner population based on a randomized selection of participants. "Weight blindness", defined here as an underassessment of normal-weight dogs and an inability to identify overweight dogs, is likely to have a negative impact on canine overweight prevalence. Deeper knowledge about dog owners' perceptions can inform the development of new strategies to help prevent and manage canine overweight, whereof standardized practical education on BCS assessment is shown here to be one example.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite this need, evidence-based data on best practices is limited and focuses on smaller or more tropical species. The objectives of this study were to survey the aquatic community regarding the husbandry and veterinary care of GPOs, with a specific focus on anesthetic and euthanasia protocols. A two-part web-based survey was distributed to four aquatic and/or veterinary email listservs. Individuals from fifty-two institutions participated in phase one. Results documented that 40 (78 percent) participating institutions currently house GPOs, with most housing one and nine institutions housing two to three GPOs. The median (range) habitat volume is 5405 (1893-16,465) L, and 78 percent of systems are closed. Of the institutions surveyed, 23 have anesthetized or sedated a GPO for nonterminal procedures, including wound care, biopsies, and hemolymph collection. Reported methods of sedation or anesthesia include magnesium chloride, ethanol, isoflurane, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222), magnesium sulfate, benzocaine, and dexmedetomidine. Drugs or methods used for euthanasia include magnesium chloride, ethanol, mechanical decerebration, pentobarbital, isoflurane, MS-222, magnesium sulfate, benzocaine, potassium chloride, dexmedetomidine, and freezing. Reported observed side effects include ineffectiveness or inadequate sedation, inking, prolonged drug effects, and behavior changes. Survey data have the potential to guide the husbandry and veterinary care of GPOs and build the framework for future prospective studies on GPO sedation and anesthesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Camels display a unique regulation characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolism, endowing them with the ability to adapt to survive drought and chronic hunger. However, the knowledge about the camel FGF21 gene regulation and its differences between humans and mice is still limited. In this study, camel FGF21 gene promoter was obtained for ~2000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the proximal promoter region sequences near the TSS between humans and camels have high similarity. Two potential core active regions are located in the -445-612 bp region. In addition, camel FGF21 promoter contains three CpG islands (CGIs), located in the -435~-1168 bp regions, significantly more and longer than in humans and mice. The transcription factor binding prediction showed that most transcription factors, including major functional transcription factors, are the same in different species although the binding site positions in the promoter are different. These results indicated that the signaling pathways involved in FGF21 gene transcription regulation are conservative in mammals. Truncated fragments recombinant vectors and luciferase reporter assay determined that camel FGF21 core promoter is located within the 800 bp region upstream of the TSS and an enhancer may exist between the -1000 and -2000 bp region. Combining molecular docking and in silico ADMET druggability prediction, two compounds were screened as the most promising candidate drugs specifically targeting FGF21. This study expanded the functions of these small molecules and provided a foundation for drug development targeting FGF21.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to the high rates, promptly detecting the causes and preventing newborns from dying are extremely important. Vitality evaluation, blood parameters, and the degree of meconium staining on the skin are valuable resources in canine perinatology. In this study, 435 puppies from 85 bitches close to parturition were recruited and divided into four quartiles according to the puppy's birth weight: Q1 (127-200 g) n = 110 puppies, Q2 (201-269 g) n = 108 puppies, Q3 (270-388 g) n = 108 puppies, and Q4 (389-464 g) n = 109 puppies. This experimental article aimed to report the effect of birth weight on the blood profile variables, the vitality of newborn puppies, and the meconium staining degree, integrating these three aspects. It was concluded that the weight of newborns was correlated with the degree of meconium staining, presenting more cases of severe meconium staining in the puppies of the highest birth weight group. The weight of the newborns was correlated with a higher number of stillbirths and alterations in the blood variables, showing the most severe cases of metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia in the puppies of the Q4 quartile. On the contrary, no statistically significant correlations were found between the weight of newborns and vitality. Nevertheless, the analysis of the results showed that the most vigorous puppies were found at Q1; however, at minute 60 after birth (AB), all the puppies in the four quartiles standardized their vitality scores.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

According to the results, only specific dietary factors at specific doses could reduce SCCs in the milk of dairy sheep and goats. The combination of Se and vitamin E in the diet was more effective in sheep than in goats, while the inclusion of polyphenols, which are also present in food matrices such as agro-industrial by-products, led to better results. Some essential oils can be conveniently used to modulate SCCs, although they can precipitate an off-flavoring problem. This work shows that SCCs are complex and cannot be determined using a single experimental factor, as intramammary inflammation, which is the main source of SC in milk, can manifest in a subclinical form without clinical signs. However, attention to mineral and vitamin supplementation, even in the most difficult cases, such as those of grazing animals, and the use of anti-inflammatory substances directly or through by-products, can improve the nutritional condition of animals and reduce their SCCs, offering undeniable benefits for the milk-processing sector as well.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Next-generation sequencing-based liquid biopsy testing for cancer detection was recently developed for dogs and has been used to study the genomic profiles of blood samples from thousands of canine patients since 2021. In this study, 4870 client-owned dogs with and without a diagnosis or suspicion of cancer underwent liquid biopsy testing by this method. Copy number variants detected exclusively in genomic DNA derived from white blood cells (WBC gDNA-specific CNVs) were observed in 126 dogs (2.6%; 95% CI: 2.2-3.1); these copy number variants were absent from matched plasma cell-free DNA, and from tumor tissue in dogs with concurrent cancer. These findings were more common in older dogs and were persistent in WBC gDNA in over 70% of patients, with little to no change in the amplitude of the signal across longitudinal samples. Many of these alterations were observed at recurrent locations in the genome across subjects; the most common finding was a partial loss on CFA25, typically accompanied by a partial gain on the same chromosome. These early findings suggest that age-related somatic alterations may be present at an appreciable frequency in the general canine population. Further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, excessive amounts of free radicals are harmful, causing DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein degeneration, and abnormal cell death. Certain viral infections induce cells to produce excessive free radicals, which in multiple ways help the virus to replicate, mature, and exit. Iron is a necessary element for many intracellular enzymes, involved in both cellular activities and viral replication. Ferroptosis, a programmed cell death mode distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis, is characterized by lipid peroxide accumulation and damage to the antioxidant system, affecting many cellular processes. Viral infection commonly manifests as decreased glutathione (GSH) content and down-regulated glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, similar to ferroptosis. Recent studies have suggested a possible relationship among free radicals, viral infections and ferroptosis. This review aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism linking free radicals and ferroptosis during viral infections and provide a new theoretical basis for studying viral pathogenesis and control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ferritin is a major acute-phase protein in dogs, increasing during inflammation; however, it could also be affected by other conditions, including trauma, iron metabolism dysregulations, neoplasia, or hypoxia. Higher ferritin levels have been reported in obese humans, but ferritin has not been explored in canine obesity. To evaluate the possible changes in serum ferritin in canine obesity, ferritin levels from lean/normal weight (CG, n = 55) and overweight/obese dogs (OG, n = 37) were measured, together with complete hemogram and biochemical analyses. Statistically significant higher ferritin levels (1.2-fold) were found in OG (median, (interquartile range), 204 (166-227.5) &#181;g/L) in comparison to CG animals (172 (137-210) &#181;g/L)), with median levels of ferritin in OG dogs above the reference range for healthy animals in our laboratory (60-190 &#181;g/L). In addition, statistically significant higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total proteins, globulins, haptoglobin, total ferric fixation capacity (TIBC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), triglycerides, and calcium were observed in OG in comparison to CG. The higher levels in ferritin, together with higher TBIC, haematocrit, and MCV, could indicate tissue hypoxia in obese dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>37505865</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Grape Pomace: Agrifood By-Product with Potential to Enhance Performance, Yolk Quality, Antioxidant Capacity, and Eggshell Ultrastructure in Laying Hens.</Title>	<Abstract>Grape pomace (GP) is an industrial by-product of grape juice making and is commonly discarded as a waste product, even with its large quantity of phytochemicals. Thus, the objectives of this trial were to examine the effects of graded dietary GP on laying rate, egg quality, yolk lipid profile, oxidative stability, shell quality and ultrastructure, and serum biochemistry. Two hundred 35-week-old laying hens were allocated to four dietary treatments with ten replicates each. Four diets were formulated by mixing a standard basal diet with GP at 0 g/kg (control), 30 g/kg (GP3%), 60 g/kg (GP6%), and 90 g/kg (GP9%). Egg production percent, egg weight, and egg mass were linearly improved (p &lt; 0.01) due to adding GP to the diets of laying hens. Eggs obtained from laying hens fed with GP diets had (p &lt; 0.01; linear, p &lt; 0.01) greater Haugh units, yolk color, albumen index, and yolk index than those of the control. The GP9% group had the greatest values (p &lt; 0.05) for shell weight, thickness, and breaking strength. Electron microscopy scanning of eggshells indicated that the incremental dietary level of GP linearly augmented the thickness of the palisade layer but reduced both the mammillary layer and mammillary knob width (p &lt; 0.01). Improved tibia-breaking strength and ash content were shown (p &lt; 0.05) in the GP-fed laying hens. The dietary addition of GP by up to 90 g/kg linearly (p &lt; 0.01) mitigated lipid oxidation and improved the antioxidant capacity in both the serum and stored eggs. A reduction in the percentages of saturated fatty acids was observed, while the contents of monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and n-3 fatty acids were augmented because of increasing dietary GP levels (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the eggs obtained from laying hens fed on the GP6% and GP9% had lower yolk cholesterol content (p &lt; 0.001); this effect was confirmed by linear and quadratic responses (p &lt; 0.001). Laying hens on GP diets had lower (p &lt; 0.01) serum hepatic enzymes, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein but greater high-density lipoprotein compared to the control. To sum up, the addition of GP in the layers' diets by up to 90 g/kg increased laying performance, enriched the yolk with beneficial fatty acids, enhanced antioxidant potential in yolk lipids, and improved shell quality and ultrastructure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The inhibitor of the NF-&#954;B (I&#954;B) family has essential effects on the NF-&#954;B pathway; however, it is unclear whether early pregnancy modulates the expression of the I&#954;B family in the thymus. In this study, maternal thymuses were sampled on day 16 of nonpregnancy and different gestation stages in the ovine, and the expression of I&#954;B proteins was analyzed. The data showed that B cell leukemia-3 and I&#954;B&#946; increased; however, I&#954;B&#945;, I&#954;B&#949;, and IKK&#947; deceased during gestation. Furthermore, there was an increase in I&#954;BNS and I&#954;B&#950; expression values on day 13 of pregnancy; however, this decreased on day 25 of gestation. In summary, the expression of the I&#954;B family was modulated in the thymus during early gestation, suggesting that the maternal thymus can be associated with maternal immunologic tolerance and pregnancy establishment in ewes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physeal tibial fractures are more specific and less frequently met in field conditions. A calf with a Salter-Harris type I distal physeal fracture of the tibia was referred to the National Veterinary School of Toulouse (ENVT), France. Although the use of external fixators in the treatment of tibial fractures is common, distal physeal tibial fractures require a different and specific technique involving them. They were first used as a lever arm to reduce the fracture due to the severe displacement. A hock joint bypass was then performed. Six weeks after treatment, the calf recovered successfully from the use of the affected limb without any adverse sequelae. The present case provides management of a distal tibial fracture using external fixators. This innovative and accessible surgical technique may be used by veterinary practitioners in future similar cases of distal tibial fractures when pins in the distal end cannot be inserted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ghrelin, a key hormone involved in the regulation of appetite and metabolism, is a potential marker of appetite dysregulation in cats with CKD. The aim of this study was to compare the plasma concentrations of acylated, desacyl, and total ghrelin in normal cats and cats with CKD. Storage methodology was investigated prior to evaluating ghrelin concentrations in normal and CKD cats to facilitate clinical sample collection. Twelve normal cats and twelve cats with CKD were enrolled. Plasma acylated and total ghrelin concentrations were measured using radioimmunoassay. Desacyl ghrelin was calculated (total ghrelin minus acylated ghrelin). Cats with CKD had significantly increased total ghrelin and calculated desacyl ghrelin concentrations in comparison to normal cats (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in active ghrelin concentrations between groups. Both total ghrelin and calculated desacyl ghrelin were significantly correlated with serum creatinine concentrations (p &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.70 and p &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.73). Elevated plasma desacyl ghrelin concentrations in cats with CKD provides evidence for dysregulation of appetite in feline CKD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Guidelines published in 2016 for prehospital management of dogs with HRI advised "cool first, transport second", and recommended using cold-water immersion and evaporative cooling (water application with air movement) as the optimal approaches to reduce the patient's temperature. The current retrospective cross-sectional observation study analysed electronic patient records from the VetCompass programme to describe the cooling methods used in dogs with HRI presented to primary care veterinary practices during 2016-2018. Of 623 HRI events identified, 341 (54.74%, 95% CI 50.81-58.60%) included information on cooling in their clinical record. Of these, 74/341 (21.70%, 95% CI 17.65-26.38%) were cooled prior to transport for veterinary care. Overall, 23.97% (95% CI 19.24-29.44%) were cooled using one of the two recommended cooling methods, whilst the most common cooling method recorded was the application of wet towels (51.31%, 95% CI 45.34-57.24%). Canine cooling guidance and messaging in both the public and veterinary sectors requires urgent review to ensure that the most effective cooling methods are promoted because delays to canine temperature reduction worsen patient outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there is a new situation in poultry disease where it is necessary to study feed additives, which can overcome the diseases that were previously controlled through the addition of antibiotics and antimicrobial growth promoters in the feed. Therefore, trehalose was investigated to determine whether it impacts the growth performance and pathogenic bacteria (C. jejuni and C. perfringens) inoculation in broilers. In the first experiment, the tolerance of broilers to the addition of trehalose to their feed was investigated. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in body weight changes, daily weight gain, feed intake or feed conversion ratio during the feeding period. Within a 35-day feeding period, it was concluded that a trehalose dosage up to 10% does not exert a negative effect on broiler farming. Moreover, there was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the broilers' growth performance, as well as C. jejuni and C. perfringens counts in the intestines and feces of broilers observed over a 5-week feeding period. However, Lactobacillus counts significantly increased in these groups with 3% and 5% trehalose supplementation. The findings indicate that trehalose supplementation in the feed cannot directly decrease C. jejuni and C. perfringens counts but may enhance gut health by raising Lactobacillus counts in chicken gut, particularly when enteropathogenic bacteria are present.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four experimental diets were tested, including a control with 100% corn stover (T1), and three additional diets with corn stover supplemented at 15% A. mearnsii leaves (T2), 30% A. mearnsii leaves (T3) and 45% of A. mearnsii leaves (T4). The highest dry matter in situ degradation (p &#8804; 0.001) and in vitro digestibility (p &#8804; 0.001) was found in T1 (80.6 and 53.4%, respectively) and T2 (76.4 and 49.6%, respectively) diets. A higher population of holotrich and entodiniomorph ruminal protozoa was found (p = 0.0001) in T1 at 12 and 24 h. Diets of T1 and T2 promoted a higher (p = 0.0001) microbial protein production (314.5 and 321.1 mg/0.5 g DM, respectively). Furthermore, a lower amount of CH4 was found (p &lt; 0.05) with T2, T3 and T4. It is concluded that it is possible to supplement up to 15% of A. mearnsii leaves (30.5 g TC/kg DM) in ruminant's diets. This decreased the population of protozoa (holotrich and entodiniomorph) as well as the CH4 production by 35.8 and 18.5%, respectively, without generating adverse effects on the ruminal degradation kinetics, nutrient digestibility and microbial protein production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505872</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparative Analysis of Methods for Somatic Cell Counting in Cow's Milk and Relationship between Somatic Cell Count and Occurrence of Intramammary Bacteria.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of this study was to compare three on-farm commercial methods for the indirect detection of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows: the California mastitis test (CMT), the Porta side somatic cell count milk test (Porta SCC), and the DeLaval cell counter (DCC), with the Fossomatic cell count (FSCC), and to evaluate the relationship between the determined somatic cell count SCC and the occurrence of intramammary pathogens in the milk of dairy cows. A total of 284 sensory unchanged mixed milk samples, collected during the milking on a dairy farm, were analyzed in this study for somatic cell counts by the mentioned on-farm tests. Quarter milk samples (n = 583) from all the selected cows were cultured. The agreement, sensitivity, and specificity of the three indirect commercial diagnostic tests (the CMT, the Porta SCC, and the DeLaval cell counter) were calculated, and the FSCC was used as the gold standard. The results were analyzed statistically using the Pearson correlation test and the paired t-test. The CMT matched with the FSCC in 83.1% of the samples, with the Porta SCC in 80.6%, and with the DCC in 80.3% of the samples. The sensitivity and specificity reached 81.0% and 92.9% for the CMT, 79.4% and 90.7% for the Porta SCC, and 75.8% and 97.5% for the DCC, respectively. The correlation between the FSCC and the Porta SCC was 0.86 (p &lt; 0.0001), and between the FSCC and the DCC, it was 0.92 (p &lt; 0.0001). The differences between them were insignificant. Bacteria were detected in 130 (22.3%) quarter milk samples. The most prevalent bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (36.2%), followed by E. coli (20%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.1%), A. viridans (9.2%), Streptococcus spp. (9.2%), Proteus spp. (6.2%), and S. intermedius (3.9%). Contagious isolates (S. aureus) were detected in 3 quarter milk samples (2.3%). The agreement between the individual tests and the microbiological culture was as follows: 69.2% for the CMT; 73.7% for the Porta SCC; 71.6% for the DCC; and 76.5% for the FSCC. Higher SCCs were detected in the milk samples contaminated with bacteria than in the healthy milk (p &lt; 0.001). No significance was found between the presence of individual species of intramammary pathogens and the different levels of SCCs. Based on the results, bacteria are the predominant cause of subclinical mastitis. The increased SCC of some milk samples with no presence of bacteria meant that the increase could have been caused by numerous other agents (viruses, fungi, or algae) or factors for mastitis in the dairy industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, quantitative studies of brain CT perfusion in veterinary medicine are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the normal range of perfusion determined via CT in brains of healthy dogs and to compare values between white matter and gray matter, differences in aging, and each hemisphere. Nine intact male beagle dogs were prospectively examined using dynamic CT scanning and post-processing for brain perfusion. Regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), mean transit time, and time to peak were calculated. Tissue ROIs were drawn in the gray matter and white matter of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes; caudate nucleus; thalamus; piriform lobe; hippocampus; and cerebellum. Significant differences were observed between the white matter regions and gray matter regions for rCBV and rCBF (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were identified between hemispheres and between young and old groups in brain regions. The findings obtained in this study involving healthy beagle dogs might serve as a reference for regional CT perfusion values in specific brain regions. These results may aid in the characterization of various brain diseases in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human medicine, thermography is used to detect heat emitted by the foot when it comes in contact with a flat surface to detect the abnormalities of the foot balance. The hypothesis states that the thermal pattern of the hoof print in Warmblood horses is detectable and it does not vary among the four limbs in leisure and cross-country Warmblood horses in terms of mean temperature of the hoof print surface. A pilot study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of thermography in temperature detection of the hoof print and to investigate the occurrence of possible differences in the mean value of six selected areas and whether there are any differences in the mean temperature of the hoof print between leisure and cross-country Warmblood horses.</Abstract><Abstract>The study included sixty non-lame Warmblood horses with all limbs taken into consideration (n = 240). The selection criteria for the horses were: no alterations in posture and no muscle group asymmetry during visual examination, no lateral or medial deviation of the carpus or hock, no reaction to the flexion tests, negative reactions to the hoof tester, no lameness during walking, trotting or lunging, no anti-inflammatory medication in the last three weeks prior to examination and rectal temperature between 37 &#176;C and 38 &#176;C. The hoof print of each hoof was measured with the horse in the standing position, all four limbs on the ground, using a FLIR E50 thermal camera. Six areas of temperature from the hoof print were taken into consideration, and for each of them, the mean value was identified using FLIR Tools software for photo interpretation. The One-Way ANOVA test was used to test the differences between the mean temperatures obtained for each selected area from all limbs and to compare the hoof print temperature values between the leisure horses and cross-country horses. Data were statistically processed using SAS Studio.</Abstract><Abstract>Thermography can detect the temperature emitted by the hoof but the thermal patterns of the hoof print show no difference for all four studied limbs. No significant statistical differences were noticed between the mean temperatures identified for each studied area. Also, there were no statistical differences between the mean temperature of the selected areas from the forelimbs and hindlimbs from the horses used for leisure and those used for cross-country. Based on this aspect, the mean temperature of one selected area can be determined in any of the four limbs, without visible variations.</Abstract><Abstract>Thermography can detect the hoof print on a flat surface and the mean temperature for each studied area can be proposed as a reference temperature value. There were no differences in the mean temperature of the hoofprint between leisure and cross-country Warmblood Horses. Further investigations are required to clarify whether there are any differences in the thermal pattern of hoof prints from other breeds or from horses with musculoskeletal conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we describe a case of cutaneous malignant melanoma arising from the skin of the scrotum in an 8-year-old male wild rabbit, with testicular metastases as an unusual metastatic site for melanoma reported in humans to date. The tumour was nearly 5 cm in size, firm, and highly pigmented, with multifocal superficial ulcerations and large areas of intratumoural necrosis. The adjacent testis was 1.5 cm, multinodular, and black, obscuring tissue morphology. Histologically, the dermis was expanded by an infiltrative, densely cellular neoplasm composed of nests and sheets of polygonal to spindle neoplastic melanocytes, supported by scant fibrovascular stroma. Neoplastic cells showed intermediate N/C ratio, moderate basophilic cytoplasm, often obscured by abundant brownish granular pigment, and eccentric nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Cellular pleomorphism and nuclear atypia were severe, and high mitotic activity was observed. Diffuse dermal lymphovascular invasion was also observed. The testis was delimited by a thin tunica albuginea, and the parenchyma was largely obscured in its morphology by densely packed neoplastic cells. Seminiferous tubules, lined with a thin basement membrane and containing neoplastic and scattered spermatogenic cells, were occasionally observed. Neoplastic cells within the skin and the testis were positive for HMB-45, Melan-A, and S-100. The growing popularity of rabbits as pets allows for a greater ability to accumulate data on the spontaneous occurrence of tumours in these animals. Furthermore, descriptions of the biological aspects of spontaneously occurring tumours may serve to improve current knowledge in animal species and humans in which the same neoplasm may occur.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hence, the objective of this experiment was to explore the differential expression (DE) of a panel of key genes within the three glandular regions of the stomach. Eight pigs were sacrificed at d 8 post-weaning, and three mucosal samples were collected from each stomach's glandular regions. The expression of a panel of genes were measured using QPCR. The true cardiac gland region was characterized by increased expression of PIGR, OLFM4, CXCL8 and MUC2 relative to the two other regions (p &lt; 0.05). The fundic gland region was characterized by increased expression of ATP4A, CLIC6, KCNQ1, HRH2, AQP4, HDC, CCKBR, CHIA, PGA5, GHRL and MBOAT4 compared to the two other regions (p &lt; 0.05). The pyloric gland region was characterized by exclusive expression of GAST (p &lt; 0.05). A transition region between the cardiac and fundic region (cardiac-to-oxyntic transition) was observed with a gene expression signature that resembles a cross of the signatures found in the two regions. In conclusion, unique gene expression signatures were identifiable in each of the glandular regions, with a cardiac-to-oxyntic transition region clearly identifiable in the post-weaned pigs' stomachs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both animals showed vision impairment and difficulty in feeding without assistance. In fact, they did not notice the presence of the food in the tank unless it was brought close to touching the mouth. Ocular ultrasonography and electroretinography showed no lesions of the vitreal body and retinal layer, therefore, both animals were candidates for bilateral cataract surgery. Topical administration of tropicamide + phenylephrine alternating with rocuronium resulted in only minimal mydriasis. Administration of intracameral rocuronium did not improve mydriasis. Phacoemulsification using a one-handed technique was performed bilaterally with a phacoemulsification device (Sovereign, AMO (Abbott Medical Optics[&#174;]). After surgery, the systemic anti-inflammatory drug (dexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg, IM daily for one week) and antibiotics (enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg IM q 72 h, for 4 weeks; ceftazidime 20 mg/kg IM q 72 h for 3 weeks) were administered. Topical ofloxacin, flurbiprofen and tobramycin/dexamethasone were instilled TID for 4 weeks. Both turtles regained vision in both eyes. Results at a 10-month follow-up were satisfactory. This is the first report of cataracts in turtles rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and the first description of surgical treatment of cataracts in loggerhead turtles so young.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In a crossover clinical scenario, we evaluated the time prior to (Pre-TempT) and after (Post-TempT) rectal and axillary thermometry in a diverse demographic of canine (n = 114) and feline (n = 72) patients. Equipment duration was controlled to determine a presumptive total time (TTime) associated with each thermometry method. Pre-TempT and TTime were significantly shorter in axillary thermometry trials for both canine and feline pets (p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in Post-TempT between thermometry methods in canine patients (p = 0.887); however, the Post-TempT was longer in felines after axillary thermometry (p = 0.004). Reductions in Pre-TempT and TTime were not significant in Scottish Fold breed cats. Within the feline rectal trials, the TTime of domestic-long-haired breeds was significantly longer than that of domestic-short-haired breeds (p = 0.019). No other tested parameter (i.e., size, body shape, age, weight, breed, coat type, or procedure order) played a significant role in these results. Axillary thermometry was faster than rectal thermometry in both canine and feline pets, primarily due to the time associated with animal approach and restraint (Pre-TempT). These results have implications for optimizing clinic workflow, appointment durations, and patient handling time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Distinct NDV genotypes are currently causing outbreaks worldwide. Due to the high genetic diversity of NDV, virulent strains that may result in a lack of vaccine protection are more likely to emerge and ultimately cause larger epidemics with massive economic losses. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the circulating NDV genotypes is critical to reduce Newcastle disease (ND) burden. In this study, NDV strains were isolated and characterized from backyard poultry farms from Tanzania, East Africa in 2021. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on fusion (F) gene amplification was conducted on 79 cloacal or tracheal swabs collected from chickens during a suspected ND outbreak. Our results revealed that 50 samples out 79 (50/79; 63.3%) were NDV-positive. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the selected NDV isolates showed that 39 isolates belonged to subgenotype VII.2 and only one isolate belonged to subgenotype XIII.1.1. Nucleotide sequences of the NDV F genes from Tanzania were closely related to recent NDV isolates circulating in southern Africa, suggesting that subgenotype VII.2 is the predominant subgenotype throughout Tanzania and southern Africa. Our data confirm the circulation of two NDV subgenotypes in Tanzania, providing important information to design genotype-matched vaccines and to aid ND surveillance. Furthermore, these results highlight the possibility of the spread and emergence of new NDV subgenotypes with the potential of causing future ND epizootics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Farmina Ultra Hypo (FUH), a hydrolyzed fish/rice starch hypoallergenic diet, is able to improve clinical signs in allergic dogs. Study objectives were to determine microbiota differences in allergic dogs before and after feeding with FUH for eight weeks. Forty skin allergic dogs were evaluated clinically before and after the diet. Unresponsive dogs were classified as canine atopic dermatitis (CAD); responsive dogs relapsing after challenge with previous foods were classified as being food reactive (AFR), and those not relapsing as doubtful (D). Sequencing of feces collected pre- and post-diet was performed, with comparisons between and within groups, pre- and post-diet, and correlations to possible altered metabolic pathways were sought. Microbiota in all dogs was dominated by Bacteroidota, Fusobacteriota, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, albeit with large interindividual variations and with some prevalence changes after the diet. In general, bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids were increased in all samples. CAD dogs showed pre-and post-diet microbiota patterns different from the other two groups. Bacteria taxa were enriched post-diet only in the AFR group. Changes in metabolic pathways were observed mainly in the CAD group. FUH may be able to improve intestinal microbiota and thus clinical signs of skin allergy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505883</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Meta-Analysis on the Global Prevalence of Tetracycline Resistance in Escherichia coli Isolated from Beef Cattle.</Title>	<Abstract>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging global concern, with the widespread use of antimicrobials in One Health contributing significantly to this phenomenon. Among various antimicrobials, tetracyclines are extensively used in the beef cattle industry, potentially contributing to the development of resistance in bacterial populations. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the association between tetracycline use in beef cattle and the development of tetracycline resistance in Escherichia coli isolates. A comprehensive search was conducted using multiple databases to gather relevant observational studies evaluating tetracycline use and tetracycline resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from beef cattle. The rate of tetracycline resistance from each study served as the effect measure and was pooled using a random-effects model, considering possible disparities among studies. The meta-analysis of 14 prospective longitudinal studies resulted in a 0.31 prevalence of tetracycline resistance in Escherichia coli in non-intervention (no exposure), contrasting numerically elevated resistance rates in the intervention (exposed) groups of 0.53 and 0.39 in those receiving tetracyclines via feed or systemically, respectively. Despite the observed numerical differences, no statistically significant differences existed between intervention and non-intervention groups, challenging the conventional belief that antimicrobial use in livestock inherently leads to increased AMR. The findings of this study underscore the need for additional research to fully understand the complex relationship between antimicrobial use and AMR development. A considerable degree of heterogeneity across studies, potentially driven by variations in study design and diverse presentation of results, indicates the intricate and complex nature of AMR development. Further research with standardized methodologies might help elucidate the relationship between tetracycline use and resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from beef cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37505884</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prospective Study Comparing Outcome following Complete Polypropylene Suture Ligation versus Partial Thin Film Band Attenuation of Congenital Portosystemic Shunts in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The main objective was to conduct a prospective study reporting the outcome for dogs with an extrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS) treated with a 'complete ligation where possible' philosophy. The second aim was to compare the outcomes following complete (C) polypropylene suture ligation versus partial thin film band (TFB) attenuation of a CPSS in dogs. Dogs that could not tolerate acute complete shunt ligation at surgery received partial shunt attenuation with TFB. Peri-operative complications, mortality, follow-up imaging findings, pre- and post-operative bile acid stimulation test results and details of any revision surgery performed were recorded. A follow-up health-related quality of life questionnaire enabled the calculation of a postoperative clinical shunt score, a quality of life score, and determined if any dogs were still on a hepatic diet and/or other medical management at a minimum of 6 months after surgery. Of the 110 dogs enrolled, 57 received complete ligation and 53 received partial TFB attenuation. Peri-operative mortality, the occurrence of post-attenuation neurological complications, the occurrence of multiple acquired shunts, the postoperative clinical shunt score and quality of life score were not significantly different between the two groups. Dogs in the C group were older, heavier and demonstrated a greater number of shunt classifications where the entry into the systemic circulation was the phrenic vein or azygous vein. Dogs in the TFB group had a greater number of unchanged bile acid concentrations after surgery, were more likely to remain on the hepatic diet and/or medical management after surgery and underwent a greater number of revision surgeries. There was variability in the precision of both ultrasound and computed tomographic angiography follow-up imaging compared to intra-operative mesenteric portovenography findings at revision surgery. Overall, dogs with an extrahepatic portosystemic shunt receiving either complete acute shunt ligation or partial TFB shunt attenuation are expected to have an excellent long-term clinical outcome and there is no reason to suggest that a dog able to tolerate complete acute shunt closure should be denied the benefit of this.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Due to its non-specific symptoms, the disease is often overlooked. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the etiology and pathology of CIA in Guangxi Province, China. Three strains of the chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) were isolated from liver samples of diseased 20-week-old chickens. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced, and experiments on specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks revealed that the GX21121 strain exhibited high virulence. Histopathological examination of the deceased chickens showed liver cell necrosis, fibrous serous exudation, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage in liver tissues, and congestion in lung and renal tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome revealed that the three strains had a close genetic relationship to the Heilongjiang wild-type strain (GenBank KY486144). The genetic evolution of their VP1 genes indicated that all three CIAV isolates belonged to genotype IIIc. In summary, this study demonstrated the genomic diversity of three CIAV strains in adult layer hens. The isolation and characterization of the GX21121 strain as a highly virulent isolate provide valuable information for further investigations into the etiology, molecular epidemiology, and viral evolution of CIAV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Obviously, carcass condemnation must be regarded as a highly undesirable event for the entire swine industry chain, as it represents the total failure of a long period of challenging work. Therefore, it seems valuable to estimate the prevalence and causes of carcasses condemnation, in order to preserve consumers' health and pig farming profitability. Bearing that in mind, the present study aimed at providing a reliable picture of the condemnation of porcine carcasses in Italy, with a special emphasis being placed upon pathological findings. Data were collected in a high-throughput abattoir located in northern Italy, where a total of 2,062,278 pigs were slaughtered during the period of study (2021-2022). Overall, 1362 pigs were considered unfit for slaughtering after ante-mortem inspection, mostly because of death during transportation or in resting pens, after their arrival at the abattoir. Moreover, 2007 carcasses were condemned after post-mortem inspection. The most common causes of condemnation were severe and diffuse peritonitis, disseminated abscesses, jaundice, and erysipelas. In our opinion, the present survey may provide useful and updated information about the condemnation of pig carcasses in Italy. At the same time, it highlights the need to collect data in a more systematic and standardized way, thus making possible their comparison over time and among different geographic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Granulosa cell tumors are a common neoplastic condition affecting the equine ovary, causing behavioral changes at rest and reduced performance. The reported success rate of ovariectomy in treating behavioral disorders is 64-86%. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the long-term follow-up of laparoscopic ovariectomy in mares in our case series, focusing on the owner's perspective of the behavior of the mares after surgery. In addition, the histopathological features of the removed ovaries were investigated. The clinical records of mares that underwent laparoscopic ovariectomy between 2015 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Owners complaining of poor behavior were interviewed about the main behavioral problem leading to referral and its eventual resolution after surgery. Eleven mares were included. The most common complaints were increased sensitivity on both flanks (10/11, 91%) and general riding problems (9/11, 82%). In 5/11 cases (45%), both ovaries were removed by laparoscopic ovariectomy. Histopathologic findings consistent with GCT/GTCT were found in five out of six examined ovaries (five granulosa theca cell tumors, GTCT). According to owner interviews, the scores assigned to each behavior improved significantly after surgery, regardless of histological findings. Although many factors can influence the behavior of horses, granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) proved to be a common cause and, as reported by the owners, ovariectomy resulted in improvement or complete resolution of the abnormal behavior.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In vivo and in vitro studies conducted mainly in mammals have shown various disorders of sexual activity and morpho-functional dysfunctions of the gonads in both sexes. Although the modalities are still unclear, cocaine has been shown to alter the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, and alter sperm motility. In females, this drug alters the formation of the meiotic spindle as well as may obstruct the ovulation mechanism of mature oocytes. The data provided in this review, in addition to reviewing the current literature on the main effects of cocaine on spermatogenesis and oogenesis mainly in mammals, will hopefully provide a basic overview that may help and support further future studies on the molecular interaction of cocaine and its metabolites with germ cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on a systematic understanding of live pig epidemics, a risk assessment index system was constructed, and the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of pig epidemics in China were explored by the entropy method. In recent years, the overall trend in pig epidemics over time first increased and then decreased; in space, the acceleration of the spread of epidemics across the country weakened. China still faces challenges, including many types and a wide range of diseases, large total livestock breeding and weak epidemic prevention and control capacity, and a large risk of introduced foreign animal epidemics. The spatial and temporal variations in the pig epidemic risk were obvious; one high-risk area, two medium-high-risk areas and 10 medium-risk areas have been found in recent years, during which time, the epidemic risk was highest in Beijing, Hainan, Liaoning, Tibet and Zhejiang. However, there were significant differences in the regional distribution of the risk level of pig epidemics in different years. To further build a secure "defense system" for the high-quality development of the pig industry, it is recommended to improve the monitoring and early warning system of pig epidemic risk, perfect the pig epidemic prevention and control system, and strengthen the regional collaboration mechanism of epidemic prevention and control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to analyze the antioxidant capacity of three natural powdered raw materials containing quercetin, bromelain, and Lentinula edodes and develop a new feed supplement for dogs using a combination of them. The total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), and ABTS (2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) of the extracts, either individually or in combination, were evaluated colorimetrically. The effects of this supplement on healthy adult dogs' nutritional, inflammatory, and stress status were evaluated. American Staffordshire Terrier adult female dogs (n = 30) were randomly assigned to a control (n = 15) or a treated (n = 15) group. The supplement was added as powder to the food of the treated dogs once daily for 28 days. There was no significant difference in the body weight and body condition scores between the initial and final phases of the experiment. At the end of our study, a significant decrease in fecal calprotectin, cortisol, indole/skatole, and N-methylhistamine and a significant increase in short-chain fatty acids were observed as compared to the control group. In conclusion, this natural feed supplement can be used to improve gastrointestinal health and psycho-physical conditions in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624274</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterization of Extended Spectrum Cephalosporin-Resistant Escherichia coli Strains Isolated from Raw Poultry Carcasses in Catering Services in Northern Greece.</Title>	<Abstract>Antimicrobial resistance is considered a topic of utmost interest under the concept of "One Health", having severe implications in both human and veterinary medicine. Among the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, especially those belonging to the order of Enterobacterales (such as Escherichia coli), hold a prominent position in terms of both virulence and possessing/disseminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) traits. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamase producing E. coli isolates in raw poultry carcasses collected from a university club. Five hundred raw poultry skin samples were collected from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh) club in Thessaloniki, Greece. A total of 64% of the samples were positive for the presence of extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The isolates were further examined for their susceptibility to selected antibiotics by the disc diffusion method and were characterized as true ESBL, as producing class C cephalosporinases (AmpC) or "of unknown etiology" by the combination disc test. The 86 of the 120 isolates (71.67%) were classified as true ESBL, 24 (20.00%) as AmpC, and 10 (8.33%) as "of unknown etiology". The isolates were screened for the occurrence of &#946;-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaOXA). Thirty-six isolates (32 ESBL- and 4 AmpC-phenotype) harbored both blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes, twenty-two isolates (among which 19 ESBL-phenotype and 2 AmpC-phenotype) harbored blaCTX-M only, whereas twenty-six (14 ESBL- and 12 AmpC-phenotype) isolates harbored blaTEM alone. No isolate harboring blaSHV or blaOXA was detected. The results demonstrate the existence of E. coli isolates producing extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases in poultry carcasses from Greece, pausing a risk for antibiotic resistance transfer to humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study indicated the existence of the newly emerging foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and first investigated its effect on the Egyptian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and cattle calves in the Beheira province, north Egypt. Twenty tongue epithelial samples from diseased calves in five infected farms were randomly collected, prepared, and propagated using baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells. Whole genomic RNA was extracted from the cells of the third passage. A FMDV genome was detected and serotyped using one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs). Nucleotide sequencing of the purified serotype-specific PCR bands was performed, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 600 base pairs of VP1 was constructed. The results identified FMDV, serotype A in all infected samples, whereas the serotypes O and SAT2 were negative. The obtained 20 sequences were identical to each other and similar to the newly reported strain in Egypt that belongs to the Europe-South America (Euro-SA) topotype. The epidemiological and clinical parameters associated with such a strain were fully recorded by veterinarians and analyzed in a single infected farm including 70 cattle and buffalo calves. It caused higher peracute mortalities in buffalo (25.7%; 95% CI: 13-43) than in cattle (8.6%; 95% CI: 2-24) calves. Severe clinical signs such as dullness, hypothermia, bradycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia were common to both except in fatal cases, whereas hyperthermia and respiratory signs were prevalent in cattle calves. In conclusion, we first characterized the newly emerging FMDV in the calves of Beheira as more fatal and severe in buffalo than in cattle calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624276</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluation of Antibody Tests for Mycobacterium bovis Infection in Pigs and Deer.</Title>	<Abstract>This study addressed the need in Great Britain for supplementary blood tests for deer and pig herds under movement restrictions due to confirmed Mycobacterium bovis infection-to enhance the overall sensitivity and reliability of tuberculosis (TB) testing and contribute to an exit strategy for these herds. We evaluated four antibody tests (lateral flow DPP VetTB Assay for Cervids, M. bovis IDEXX ELISA, Enferplex Cervid and Porcine antibody tests and an in-house comparative PPD ELISA) using serum samples from defined cohorts of TB-infected and TB-free deer and pigs. TB-infected deer included two separate cohorts; farmed deer that had received a tuberculin skin test less than 30 days prior, and park deer that had received no prior skin test. In this way, we were able to assess the effect of the skin test anamnestic boost upon antibody test sensitivity. We tested a total of 402 TB-free pigs and 416 TB-free deer, 77 infected farmed deer and 105 infected park deer, and 29 infected pigs (including 2 wild boar). For deer, we found an equivalent high performance of all four tests: specificity range 98.8-99.5% and sensitivity range 76.6-85.7% for skin test-boosted infected deer, and 51.4-58.1% for non-boosted infected deer. These data suggest an overall approximate 25% increase in test sensitivity for infected deer following a skin test boost. For pigs, the tests again had equivalent high specificity of 99-99.5% and a sensitivity range of 62.1-86.2%, with substantial agreement for three of the four tests. Retrospective application of the ELISA tests to individual culled park deer and wild boar that showed no obvious evidence of TB at larder inspection identified a significant seropositivity within wild boar suggestive of low-level M. bovis infection that would otherwise not have been detected. Overall this investigation provided a robust evaluation of four antibody tests, which is essential to generate confidence in test performance before a wider deployment within TB control measures can be considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim was to compare the concentration of gentamicin in nasal lavage fluid (NALF) and in serum after three topical protocols. This was a prospective crossover study of ten healthy dogs. Gentamicin was nebulized for a duration of 1 week, twice a day, for 10 min in the first protocol (10-min protocol) and for 3 min in the second protocol (3-min protocol), while the third protocol consisted of the administration of 0.25 mL of gentamicin in each nostril (drop protocol). Median concentrations of gentamicin in NALF were 9.39 &#181;g/mL (8.12-19.97 interquartile range), 4.96 &#181;g/mL (4.60-6.43) and 137.00 &#181;g/mL (110.5-162.00) in the 10-min protocol, 3-min protocol and drop protocol, respectively. The result for the drop protocol was significantly higher than those of both nebulization protocols in NALF (p = 0.039). In serum, the gentamicin concentration was 0.98 &#181;g/mL (0.65-1.53) and 0.25 &#181;g/mL (0.25-0.44) in the 10-min and 3-min protocols, respectively. Gentamicin was not detected in the serum of seven out of ten dogs in the drop protocol, and gentamicin was significantly higher in the 10-min protocol compared to the drop protocol (p = 0.001). This study found that the 10-min, 3-min and drop protocols achieved superior concentrations in NALF compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin-sensitive bacteria, while remaining below the toxic values in blood.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), which primarily infects porcine alveolar macrophages and disrupts the immune system. Unfortunately, there is no specific drug to cure PRRS, so vaccination is crucial for controlling the disease. There are various types of single and combined vaccines available, including live, inactivated, subunit, DNA, and vector vaccines. Among them, live vaccines provide better protection, but cross-protection is weak. Inactivated vaccines are safe but have poor immune efficacy. Subunit vaccines can be used in the third trimester of pregnancy, and DNA vaccines can enhance the protective effect of live vaccines. However, vector vaccines only confer partial protection and have not been widely used in practice. A PRRS vaccine that meets new-generation international standards is still needed. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit, live vector, DNA, gene-deletion, synthetic peptide, virus-like particle, and other types of vaccines for the prevention and control of PRRS. The aim is to provide a theoretical basis for vaccine research and development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In general, they trigger factors that can affect human health due to zoonoses. Therefore, this study aims to identify the main intestinal parasites obtained from the fecal samples of dogs and cats in the municipality of Jata, Brazil, and their associated risk factors. Between October 2020 and March 2022, fecal samples were collected from 359 dogs and 55 cats through spontaneous defecation and subsequently subjected to coproparasitological analyses using the Willis fluctuation and Hoffman spontaneous sedimentation techniques. The following parasitic species were identified: Ancylostoma spp., Toxocara spp., Trichuris vulpis, Dipylidium caninum; Giardia spp., Entamoeba spp., Cystoisospora spp., and Platynosomum fastosum. The risk factors associated with parasitism include age, average income of owners, access to garbage, sewage, waste, outdated deworming, and contact with animals. The results demonstrate the need to establish public policies and implement preventive and control measures to reduce the occurrence of parasites in animals and the exposure of humans to pathogenic agents.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The leaflet-annulus index (LAI) was originally used in humans as a predictor of mitral regurgitation (MR) after mitral valve repair surgery. This index represents the quantity and severity of MR since it is affected by annular dilation. Recently, LAI was adapted to veterinary medicine, and its usefulness as an indicator of annular dilation on 2D transthoracic echocardiography in MMVD dogs was suggested. For this study, 135 Maltese dogs were selected and divided into groups of control, B1, and B2, according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement. The following data were collected: radiographic indices including the vertebral heart score and vertebral left atrial size, echocardiographic indices including the left-atrium-to-aortic-root ratio (LA:Ao), left ventricular internal diameter at diastole, normalized for body weight, and anteroposterior length and LAI measured on right parasternal long-axis view. The results showed a significant difference in LAI between each group, becoming smaller as the disease progressed. Also, there was a significant correlation between LAI and each index, showing the strongest correlation with LA:Ao. LAI could be helpful as a new indicator used for the determination of severity and prognosis in Maltese dogs with MMVD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In contrast, PRRSV is unlikely to cause mid-term placental transmission but may cause late-term abortions and weakness of piglets. This case report describes a sudden occurrence of mummified foetuses of various sizes and stillborns and delayed birth (&gt;115 days) in more than 50% of sows from one farrowing batch, while newborn piglets were mostly vital. Neither increased embryonic death nor infertility was reported. Three litters with mummies, autolysed piglets and stillborn piglets were investigated, and infections with porcine parvoviruses, porcine teschoviruses, porcine circoviruses, encephalomyocarditis virus, Leptospira spp. and Chlamydia spp. were excluded. Instead, high viral loads of PRRSV were detected in the thymus pools of piglets at all developmental stages, even in piglets with a crown-rump length between 80 and 150 mm, suggesting a potential mid-term in utero transmission of the virus. Genomic regions encoding structural proteins (ORF2-7) of the virus were sequenced and identified the virulent PRRSV-1 strain AUT15-33 as the closest relative. This case report confirms the diversity of PRRSV and its potential involvement in foetal death in mid-gestation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this retrospective multicentric cohort study was to investigate the prognostic significance of pre-operative hematological/inflammatory indices in a cohort of client-owned dogs with appendicular OSA receiving standardized treatment. Cut-offs associated with progression-free survival (PFS) for pre-operative hematological values/ratios were established using the minimal p-value approach. Historical prognostic factors were also assessed. Statistical analyses were performed for the whole population and after the exclusion of sighthounds. Fifty-nine dogs were included (13 were sighthounds). Multivariable analysis revealed that a low neutrophil count (&lt;4.37 &#215; 10[9]/L, HR0.28, CI 95% 0.13-0.61, p = 0.001), a high red blood cell count (&#8805;7.91, HR3.5, CI 95% 1.56-7.9, p = 0.002), and a proximal humerus location (HR3.0, CI 95% 1.48-6.1, p = 0.002) were associated with shorter PFS. In the sighthound-only population, only OSA location was significantly associated with PFS in univariable analysis. When sighthounds were excluded, a low neutrophil count, a low monocyte count, and a proximal humerus location were associated with shorter PFS, in multivariable analysis. Neutrophil count and possibly monocyte and red blood cell counts can be useful prognostic markers in canine OSA treated with amputation and adjuvant carboplatin. However, not all indices are appropriate in sighthounds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624283</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Analysis of Fecal Microbial Changes in Young Calves Following Bovine Rotavirus Infection.</Title>	<Abstract>The objective of the present study was to identify changes in fecal microbiota and predict the functional features of healthy calves and those infected with rotavirus over time. Six Holstein calves (average body weight 43.63 &#177; 1.19 kg, age-matched within 5-7 d) were randomly selected and distributed into two groups which contained three calves each. Fecal samples were taken 3 days before inoculation and on days 1 and 7 post-inoculation. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed. Bacterial diversity tended to decrease in the rota group, as indicated by the alpha (evenness, p = 0.074 and Shannon, p = 0.055) and beta (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, p = 0.099) diversity at 1 day post-inoculation. Differences in the bacterial taxa between healthy and rota-infected calves were detected using a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LDA &gt; 2.0, p &lt; 0.05). Rota calves had a higher abundance of certain bacterial taxa, such as Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia-Shigella, and a lower abundance of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as Alistipes, Faecalibacterium, Pseudoflavonifractor, Subdoligranulum, Alloprevotella, Butyricicoccus, and Ruminococcus, compared to the healthy calves. The observed changes in the fecal microbiota of the rota-infected group compared to the healthy group indicated potential dysbiosis. This was further supported by significant differences in the predicted functional metagenomic profiles of these microbial communities. We suggest that calves infected with bovine rotavirus had bacterial dysbiosis, which was characterized by lower diversity and fewer observed genera than the fecal microbiota of healthy calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Serum uremic toxin concentrations were measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and the fecal microbiome was characterized using shallow sequence shotgun metagenomics. Cats that consumed the HPD had higher pCS concentrations at 8 weeks (p = 0.028) when compared to baseline. After 12 weeks, cats fed the HPD had higher fecal alpha diversity indices at both the taxonomic and functional levels and lower fecal Bifidobacterium relative abundance compared to those cats fed the LPD. In conclusion, a change in diet and dietary protein concentration shifted the fecal microbial community and microbial function. Feeding cats a high amount of protein increased serum concentrations of the uremic toxin pCS; however, the effect was short-lived.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624285</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effect of Peganum harmala Total Alkaloid Extract on Sexual Behavior and Sperm Parameters in Male Mice.</Title>	<Abstract>The study was designed to evaluate the effects of the total alkaloid extract of Algerian Peganum harmala seeds on sexual behavior and male reproductive function. After two weeks of acclimatization, the male mice were randomly divided into four groups (seven mice in each group). For 35 days, the extract was administered orally at dose levels of 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg body weight per day to the respective groups of male mice (n = 7) and normal saline daily to the control group. On day 28, sexual behavior parameters were recorded. At the end of the trial, reproductive organ weights, sperm quality, seminal fructose, and testosterone hormone levels were evaluated. The three treated groups were compared with the control using statistical variance analysis (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05), followed by Tukey's test. The results of the groups treated with 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg of P. harmala alkaloid revealed the MF and IF parameters to be the lowest compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). However, the male mice treated with 25 mg/kg recorded the highest values. A low significant value of ML was observed in the group treated with 25 mg/kg of the total alkaloid extract of P. harmala compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.01), while a rise was observed in the concentration group treated with 6.25 mg/kg. Regarding IL, the male mice treated with different concentrations of the total alkaloid extract of P. harmala recorded a higher time than the control group. Moreover, an increase in the gonadosomatic index was noticed in all groups compared to the control group. However, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.01) decrease in the sperm counts of the groups treated with 12.5 mg/kg and 6.25 mg/kg. However, there was no significant difference in the motility, membrane integrity, and total antioxidant capacity of sperm cells compared to the control. The extract treatment also brought about a non-significant increase in fructose content of the seminal vesicle and serum testosterone level. The findings of this study demonstrate that the extract acts in a dose-dependent manner, and it has varying effects on the reproductive parameters of male mice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The groups were then divided into two further subgroups, namely the resynchronization subgroup group (hCG+resynch) and group (resynch)) and the no resynchronization subgroup (Group (hCG) and group (control)). All the groups started with progesterone-containing sponge insertion on Day 7. The sponge was removed after 7 days (on Day 0), and 600 IU eCG + 131.5 &#181;g PGF2&#945; was injected. The animals in group (hCG+resynch) and group (hCG) received hCG injection at the time of sponge administration. Accordingly, four different groups were established, i.e., resynchronization + hCG administration group (hCG+resynch); n:25), no resynchronization + hCG administration (group (hCG); n:25), resynchronization + no hCG administration (group (resynch); n:25), and no resynchronization + no hCG administration (Group (control); n:25). Estrus rates at the first application in group (hCG+resynch), group (hCG), group (resynch), and group (control) groups were 76%, 88%, 96%, and 76%, respectively, and pregnancy rates were 52%, 64%, 72%, and 60%, respectively; there were no intergroup statistical differences in the two parameters above. It was concluded that resynchronization performed with two consecutive stimulations during anestrus could help save time and provide a pregnancy rate at a level that can provide economic returns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood work from the initial presentation (day 0) revealed a severe, mixed hepatopathy. Over the course of the patient's hospitalization, the patient developed liver insufficiency. Urine was submitted for toxicological screening and revealed detection of a trace concentration of alpha-amanitin. The patient was treated supportively for alpha-amanitin intoxication and was discharged from the hospital on day 8, with most biochemical parameters being markedly improved. The patient was persistently hyporexic at the time of discharge. On day 15, at a recheck appointment, the patient had lost 2.4 kg and liver enzymology revealed improved values. On day 24, the patient was presented for anorexia and vomiting and had lost another 2.3 kg. Blood work and endocrinological testing at that time were consistent with hypoadrenocorticism. The patient was started on glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. At day 106, the patient was doing well clinically while receiving monthly mineralocorticoids and daily glucocorticoids. This case report is the first to describe the chronological association between alpha-amanitin-induced liver dysfunction and the subsequent development of adrenal insufficiency in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diets 1 and 2 contained 10% FM, Diets 3 and 4 contained 5% FM, and Diet 5 and 6 contained 0% FM. In contrast, Diets 2, 4, and 6 were supplemented with 0.2% AE. The results showed that FM reduction inhibited growth performance, while AE supplementation alleviated growth inhibition. FM reduction significantly decreased the crude protein levels of the whole body, while the contents of whole-body lipids were significantly decreased with AE supplementation. There were no significant changes in ALB, ALP, ALT, AST, TP, GLU, GLU, and TC in plasma. FM reduction with AE supplementation mitigated the decrease in antioxidant capacity by heightening the activity of antioxidant enzymes and related gene expressions, which mitigated the decrease in immune capacity by affecting the expression of inflammatory factors. In summary, AE supplementation could alleviate the negative effects of FM reduction in Gibel carp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 526 samples were collected from 85 pig farms in Zhejiang Province and surrounding areas. In this study, samples were analyzed using bacterial isolation and purification, Gram staining, PCR amplification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 36 Pasteurella multocida (Pm) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 6.84%; 37 Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 7.03%; 60 Glasserella parasuis (G. parasuis) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 11.41%; 170 Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 32.32%; 67 Streptococcus suis (SS) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 12.74%; 44 Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 8.37%; and 7 Salmonella enteritis (SE) isolates were detected, with an isolation rate of 1.33%. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing against 21 types of antibiotics was carried out on the isolated strains, and the results showed that 228 strains had varying degrees of resistance to 21 antibiotics, including Pm, Bb, E. coli, and APP, with the highest resistance to lincomycin, at 100%. Pm and APP were the most sensitive to cephalothin, with resistance rates of 0. In terms of strains, Pm had the highest overall sensitivity to 21 antibiotics, and E. coli had the highest resistance. In short, bacterial diseases in Zhejiang and the surrounding areas were harmful, and the drug resistance situation was severe. This study provides scientific guidance for the clinical treatment of bacterial diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

P. gulae is considered the main pathogen involved in periodontal disease in dogs. However, the characteristics of the VSCs produced by P. gulae are unknown. In the present study, VSCs were measured in 26 isolates of P. gulae and some isolates of the other Porphyromonas spp. obtained from the oral cavities of dogs with periodontal disease using an in vitro assay with an Oral Chroma[TM] gas chromatograph. The results demonstrated that P. gulae was able to produce large amounts of H2S and CH3SH, and the dominant product was CH3SH (CH3SH/H2S was approximately 2.2). Other Porphyromonas spp. that were also obtained from the oral cavities of dogs with periodontal disease indicated similar levels of production of H2S and CH3SH to those of P. gulae. It is strongly suggested that the high levels of H2S and CH3SH produced by P. gulae and other Porphyromonas spp. contribute to halitosis and the destruction of periodontal tissues during the progression of periodontal disease in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The goal of the study was to review CT examinations of the heads of rabbits and guinea pigs to identify and classify incidental findings. (2) Methods: 60 CT studies of the heads of rabbits and 65 of guinea pigs presented at 2 Institutions were reviewed and the indications for the study recorded. (3) Results: The presence of CT findings not directly related to the reason for the CT examination was present in 40/60 (66.7%) studies of rabbits and in 42/65 (64.4%) studies of guinea pigs. Most commonly, the incidental findings involved the ears, in 24/60 studies in rabbits and in 29/65 studies in guinea pigs. Incidental findings involved the nasal cavities, respectively, in 9 and 7 rabbits and guinea pigs. Soft tissue mineralization was present in 11 rabbits and 17 guinea pigs. (4) Conclusions: Based on the present study, incidental findings detected on CT studies are often present in rabbits and guinea pigs. Veterinarians should be aware of the possible clinical impact of these findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To better understand the prevalence and inform treatment, we audited laboratory data at the Bacteriology Laboratory of the NVRI from 2018-2021. Antibiotics were classified into seven basic classes: quinolones, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, nitrofuran, and cephalosporins. Trends were analysed using a generalised linear model with a log link function for the Poisson distribution, comparing proportions between years with an offset to account for the variability in the total number of organisms per year. Avian (73.18%) samples were higher than any other sample. The major isolates identified were Escherichia. coli, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Proteus spp., and Pseudomonas spp. We found that antimicrobial resistance to baseline antibiotics increased over the years. Of particular concern was the increasing resistance of Klebsiella spp. to cephalosporins, an important second-generation antibiotic. This finding underscores the importance of farm animals as reservoirs of pathogens harbouring antimicrobial resistance. Effective biosecurity, surveillance, and frugal use of antibiotics in farms are needed because the health of humans and animals is intricately connected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed to investigate the envelope glycoprotein I (gI) of PRV, a strong immunogen, and its potential as an efficient and low-cost diagnostic reagent. In this study, the DNA of the PRV SC strain was used as the template, and the recombinant fragment of gI (633 bp) was amplified via PCR using synthetic primers, and was then ligated into the pET-30a expression vector. The constructs were transferred into Escherichia coli (E. coli) for prokaryotic expression, and the antigenicity of the expression products was identified by Western blot analysis with pig positive serum against PRV. The recombinant protein was purified by a Ni column, and BALB/c mice were immunized with purified gI protein to obtain anti-gI-positive serum. After PK-15 cells had been infected by PRV for 48 h, the immunogenicity of purified gI protein was identified with a fluorescence immunoassay using anti-gI mouse serum. The recombinant plasmid (pET-30a-gI) was expressed, and the native gI protein was obtained after denaturation by urea and renaturation by dialysis. A small-scale ELISA test containing 1.0 &#181;g/mL of purified gI protein was designed to evaluate pig serum (80 samples), and the results of the ELISA test were compared to those of competitive ELISA (cELISA) tests using IDEXX Kits, which resulted in 97.5% consistency. The results suggested that the truncated gI protein may be a potential diagnostic reagent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We report an acute leptospirosis case in a puppy housed at a municipal kennel and the subsequent diagnostic investigations carried out on all dogs housed in the kennel. Laboratory investigation included mainly a microagglutination test, real-time PCR, and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) for Leptospira genus. Other agents of infection were excluded. The puppy resulted positive for Leptospira interrogans Icterohaemorrhagiae both with serological and molecular assays. All of the other 66 dogs in the kennel underwent clinical and laboratory investigations twice, 15 days apart. No other dog showed leptospirosis clinical signs. At the first sampling, eight dogs (12%) showed antibodies against Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorragiae serovar Copenhageni. Real-time PCR on urine samples of seropositive dogs detected Leptospira spp. DNA in one sample, then identified as Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorragiae by MLST. Fifteen days after, four of the previous seropositive dogs still showed antibodies against Leptospira spp. All urine samples collected from seropositive dogs were negative at real-time PCR. The study allowed the early confirmation of a Leptospirosis case and the identification of at least one asymptomatic carrier of pathogenic Leptospira spp. The prompt activation of all appropriate management measures allowed limiting and extinguishing the infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been employed in humans to enhance wound healing for decades. The existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT remains uncertain in equine medicine. The aim of this review is to investigate NPWT applications and benefits in horses. A scoping review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews on three databases (PubMed, Web of Science-Thompson Reuters, and Wiley Online Library). Twenty-four manuscripts were considered. After removing duplicates, 17 papers underwent abstract screening. Of these, 16 + 1 (cited by others) were evaluated for eligibility according to PICOs, including no case reports/retrospective studies, four original articles, and three reviews. Fifteen manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. The focus of the articles was wound management; they included three reports of wounds communicating with synovial structures. Traumatic wounds and surgical-site infections are indications for NPWT. NPWT presents several advantages and few complications making it an attractive alternative to conventional wound management. However, randomized controlled trials should be performed to quantify the benefits and establish precise protocols in horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624296</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The History and Prospects of Rabbit Sperm Sexing.</Title>	<Abstract>Sperm sex selection is a longstanding challenge in the field of animal reproduction. The cuniculture industry, in particular producers of males or females for breeding purposes, would greatly benefit from the pre-selection of the offspring's sex. This review article overviews the current and future developments in rabbit sperm sexing technologies, as well as the implications of implementing these methodologies in cuniculture. The first attempts of sperm sexing were performed in rabbits; however, a both efficient and cost-effective methodology was not yet developed for this species. Those included sperm sexing according to differences in sperm density, surface electric charge, pH susceptibility, antisera reaction, and flow cytometry. Separation by flow cytometry has proven to be efficient in rabbits, yielding fractions with approximately 81% and 86% purity for X- and Y-sperm, respectively. However, it is not cost-effective for cuniculture and decreases sperm quality. The advantages, limitations, and practical considerations of each method are presented, highlighting their applicability and efficiency. Furthermore, herein we explore the potential of immunological-based techniques that overcome some of the limitations of earlier methods, as well as recent advancements in sperm sexing technologies in other animal models, which could be applied to rabbits. Finally, the challenges associated with the development and widespread implementation of rabbit sperm sexing technologies are addressed. By understanding the advantages and limitations of existing and emerging methods, researchers can direct their efforts towards the most promising directions, ultimately contributing to a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable cuniculture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Reducing the usage of antibiotics for mastitis treatment allows the risks to be minimized related to the development of antimicrobial resistance and the excretion of antibiotics into the environment. The aim of the study was to determine the physico-chemical properties, stability and antimicrobial effect of a newly formulated biocide for post-milking udder hygiene containing a thickener made from hydroxypropyl guar gum, an antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate and teat skin-friendly components including glycerol, Mentha Arvensis herbal oil and Aesculus hippocastanum extract. Hydroxypropyl guar gum was used as a thickener to provide the physical parameters and to retain the viscosity at 1438 mPa.s. The physical and chemical properties of the product, including the 12-month stability, were tested in long-term and accelerated stability studies. The product was effective against the primary mastitis pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The treatments were initiated prior to breeding and continued throughout gestation until weaning. Liver biopsies were collected for analysis of mineral content. Cow body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), pregnancy data, calf weaning weight (WW), and antibody response of the calves were recorded. The cows receiving the INORG treatment had a greater BW (p &lt; 0.05) and BCS (p &lt; 0.01) at breeding in Year 2, while the cows on the ORG treatment had a greater (p &lt; 0.05) BW at weaning in Year 2.

This study aimed to compare the localization and expression of JAK1 and JAK3 in the skin of atopic dogs before and after allergen exposure. Skin biopsies taken from atopic beagles sensitized to house dust mites (HDM) before (D0) and after four weeks (D28) of allergen exposure were stained. Staining was subjectively scored by examiners unaware of the source of the slides. Image J was used for the semiquantitative assessment of staining intensity. JAK1 and JAK3 staining was epidermal and dermal. JAK1 staining was cytoplasmic, primarily found in basal keratinocytes and dermal cells, while JAK 3 was nuclear (all epidermal levels and on dermal inflammatory cells). Epidermal thickness was significantly higher on D28 than on D0 (p &lt; 0.0001). For JAK1, epidermal staining divided by epithelial thickness was significantly lower on D28 (p = 0.0002) compared to D0. For JAK3 staining, intensity in the dermis was significantly higher on D28 (p = 0.0405) compared to D0. We conclude that decreased expression of JAK1 in the epidermis and increased expression of JAK3 in the dermis of atopic dogs occur after allergen exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Developing effective drugs for FIP is crucial due to its global prevalence and severity. In this study, six antiviral drugs were tested for their cytotoxicity, cell viability, and antiviral efficacies in Crandell-Reese feline kidney cells. A cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that these drugs were safe to be used with essentially no cytotoxicity with concentrations as high as 250 &#181;M for ruxolitinib; 125 &#181;M for GS441524; 63 &#181;M for teriflunomide, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir; and 16 &#181;M for ritonavir. GS441524 and nirmatrelvir exhibited the least detrimental effects on the CRFK cells, with 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values of 260.0 &#181;M and 279.1 &#181;M, respectively, while ritonavir showed high toxicity (CC50 = 39.9 &#181;M). In the dose-response analysis, GS441524, nirmatrelvir, and molnupiravir demonstrated promising results with selectivity index values of 165.54, 113.67, and 29.27, respectively, against FIPV. Our study suggests that nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir hold potential for FIPV treatment and could serve as alternatives to GS441524. Continued research and development of antiviral drugs are essential to ensure the well-being of companion animals and improve our preparedness for future outbreaks of coronaviruses affecting animals and humans alike.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The main goal of this research was to develop models for the prediction of BW and BCS of horses in the practice using both common morphometric measurements and measurements of Cresty Neck Score (CNS) and Muscle Atrophy Scoring System (MASS) as a measure of muscularity. Our model showed that the BW of horses could be predicted with high reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.97), accuracy (0.99), and precision (0.97) using the morphometric measurements of the height at withers, circumference of the chest, cane circumference, body length, and body circumference as well as the BCS, CNS, and muscle atrophy score of the hindlimbs. The stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the BCS of horses can be predicted with the data of parameters such as age, body length and an index consisting of measurements of the body circumference to height of withers, and the atrophy of the neck. Future research should use larger cohorts of animals to validate the findings of this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624302</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Cobalt Iron Oxide (CoFe2O4) Nanoparticles Induced Toxicity in Rabbits.</Title>	<Abstract>The market for nanoparticles has grown significantly over the past few decades due to a number of unique qualities, including antibacterial capabilities. It is still unclear how nanoparticle toxicity works. In order to ascertain the toxicity of synthetic cobalt iron oxide (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles (CIONPs) in rabbits, this study was carried out. Sixteen rabbits in total were purchased from the neighborhood market and divided into two groups (A and B), each of which contained eight rabbits. The CIONPs were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. Crystallinity and phase identification were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The average size of the nanoparticles (13.2 nm) was calculated by Scherrer formula (Dhkl = 0.9 &#955;/&#946; cos &#952;) and confirmed by TEM images. The saturation magnetization, 50.1 emug[-1], was measured by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). CIONPs were investigated as contrast agents (CA) for magnetic resonance images (MRI). The relaxivity (r = 1/T) of the MRI was also investigated at a field strength of 0.35 T (Tesla), and the ratio r2/r1 for the CIONPs contrast agent was 6.63. The CIONPs were administrated intravenously into the rabbits through the ear vein. Blood was collected at days 5 and 10 post-exposure for hematological and serum biochemistry analyses. The intensities of the signal experienced by CA with CIONPs were 1427 for the liver and 1702 for the spleen. The treated group showed significantly lower hematological parameters, but significantly higher total white blood cell counts and neutrophils. The results of the serum biochemistry analyses showed significantly higher and lower quantities of different serum biochemical parameters in the treated rabbits at day 10 of the trial. At the microscopic level, different histological ailments were observed in the visceral organs of treated rabbits, including the liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, and brain. In conclusion, the results revealed that cobalt iron oxide (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles induced toxicity via alterations in multiple tissues of rabbits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624303</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>How Does Epidemic Prevention Training for Pig Breeding Affect Cleaning and Disinfection Procedures Adoption? Evidence from Chinese Pig Farms.</Title>	<Abstract>African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly infectious disease, severely affecting domestic pigs and wild boar. It has significantly contributed to economic losses within the pig farming industry. As a critical component of biosecurity measures, the selection of cleaning and disinfection (C&amp;D) procedures is a dynamic and long-term decision that demands a deeper knowledge base among pig farmers. This study uses a binary logit model to explore the effect of epidemic prevention training on the adoption of C&amp;D procedures among pig farmers with irregular and regular C&amp;D procedures based on micro-survey data obtained from 333 pig farmers from Sichuan. The endogeneity issue was handled using propensity score matching, resulting in solid conclusions. In addition, the critical mediating impact of biosecurity cognition was investigated using a bootstrap analysis. The empirical study demonstrated that epidemic prevention training encourages pig farmers to adopt C&amp;D procedures, with biosecurity cognition significantly mediating. Furthermore, epidemic prevention training was more likely to promote the adoption of C&amp;D procedures among pig farmers with shorter breeding experiences and those having breeding insurance.

Although several PCV3 investigations have been carried out, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenicity of PCV3, mostly due to the limited number of PCV3 isolates that are readily available. In this study, PCV3-DB-1 was isolated in PK-15 cells and characterized in vitro. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of PCV-like particles, and in situ hybridization RNA analysis demonstrated the replication of PCV3 in PK-15 cell culture. Based on phylogenetic analysis of PCV3 isolates from the Heilongjiang province of China, PCV3-DB-1 with 24 alanine and 27 lysine in the Cap protein was originally isolated and determined to belong to the clade PCV3a.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624305</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Electrocardiographic Reference Values in Clinically Healthy Lusitano Horses.</Title>	<Abstract>The Lusitano horse is gaining popularity in the equestrian world, and as a result, the significance of applied sports medicine for this breed is growing. As cardiology plays a crucial role in this field, numerous studies have been conducted to establish electrocardiographic reference values in various breeds to ensure a more accurate evaluation. However, studies regarding healthy Lusitano horses are lacking. So, this study aimed to establish electrocardiographic reference values for Lusitano horses, utilizing a sample of 82 clinically healthy animals. The evaluation involved lead II and base-apex lead measurements, with a median heart rate of 39 beats per minute being recorded. The P wave demonstrated a predominantly bifid configuration, while the QRS complex exhibited various forms. The most common QRS configurations were QR and R in lead II, and RS in the base-apex lead. Additionally, most T waves displayed a biphasic shape in both methods. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were noted based on age and gender. Some of the electrocardiographic values obtained differed from those previously published for other breeds. Given the relevance of electrocardiogram in cardiovascular evaluation, these findings bring valuable insights regarding the specific parameters for Lusitano horse and emphasize the importance of obtaining breed-specific electrocardiographic reference values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624306</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Understanding the Immunomodulatory Effects of Bovine Colostrum: Insights into IL-6/IL-10 Axis-Mediated Inflammatory Control.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine colostrum (COL), the first milk secreted by lactating cows postpartum, is a rich source of bioactive compounds that exert a significant role in the survival, growth, and immune development of neonatal calves. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of COL on cytokine production in vitro using a Caco-2/THP-1 macrophage co-culture model stimulated with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). COL pretreatment significantly reduced IL-6 (241.3 pg/mL) production induced by PMA (p &lt; 0.05), while increasing IL-10 production (45.3 pg/mL), in comparison to PMA control (441.1 and 12.5 pg/mL, respectively). Further investigations revealed that the IL-6 suppressive effect of colostrum was heat-sensitive and associated with components of higher molecular mass (100 kDa). Moreover, colostrum primarily influenced THP-1 macrophages rather than Caco-2 epithelial cells. The effects of colostrum on IL-6 production were associated with reduced NF-&#954;B activation in THP-1 macrophages. In calf-FMT transplanted C57BL/6 murine model, colostrum decreased intestinal permeability, reduced immune cell infiltration and intestinal score, and suppressed IL-6 (142.0 pg/mL) production during S. typhimurium infection, in comparison to control animals (215.2 pg/mL). These results suggest the immunomodulatory activity of bovine colostrum and its potential applications in inflammatory disorders. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate the findings in bovine models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, the current work aimed at molecularly testing samples of sheep and goats reared in Lithuania to identify Sarcocystis species described in other intermediate hosts but suspected to be non-canonical parasites to these small ruminants. For this purpose, muscle samples from 47 domestic sheep and nine goats were examined. Sarcocystis species were identified using direct and nested PCR targeting cox1 and sequencing of positive amplified products. Along with the detection of the canonical Sarcocystis spp. in their respective intermediate hosts, the DNA of S. capracanis and S. morae was detected in sheep, although these species were previously thought to be specific to goats and deer, respectively. In addition, DNA from S. arieticanis and S. tenella was found in goats, even though these two species were believed to be sheep-specific. Notably, under light microscopy, only sarcocysts of S. capracanis specific to goats were observed. Thus, future research on the life cycle and host-specificity of Sarcocystis spp. examined is warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It can induce immune imbalance in animals or humans. Penthorum chinense Pursh (PCP) is a traditional herbal plant that has been used as a hepatoprotective drug with a long history in China. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese Medicine, we prepared Penthorum chinense Pursh Compound (PCPC) by combining four herbal medicines: 5 g Penthorum chinense Pursh, 5 g Radix bupleuri, 1 g Artemisia capillaris Thunb and 1 g Radix glycyrrhizae. The role of the Penthorum chinense Pursh Compound (PCPC) in preventing AFB1-induced immune imbalance in broiler chickens was studied. A total of 180 broiler chickens were equally distributed in six groups: controls, AFB1, YCHD and high-, medium- and low-dose PCPC treatment groups. After 28 days, broilers were anesthetized, and serum spleen and thymus samples were collected for analysis. Results show that AFB1 significantly increased and decreased the relative organ weight of the spleen and thymus, respectively. Pathological section of hematoxylin/eosin (H&amp;E) stained spleen sections showed that AFB1 resulted in splenic tissue damage. Both the serum levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) were suppressed in the AFB1 group. IL-6 was elevated in the AFB1 group. The balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#947; and IL-2) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4) was disturbed by AFB1. The apoptosis-related protein and JAK/STAT pathway-related gene expression indicated that AFB1-induced apoptosis via JAK/STAT pathway. PCPC has proven its immunoprotective effects by preventing AFB1-induced immune imbalance. PCPC can be applied as a novel immune-modulating medicine in broiler chickens. It can be applied as a novel immune modulator in veterinary clinical practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37624309</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Epidemiological Factors Associated with Gross Diagnosis of Pulmonary Pathology in Feedyard Mortalities.</Title>	<Abstract>Respiratory disease continues to be the major cause of mortality in feedyard cattle, with bronchopneumonia (BP) and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) as the two most common syndromes. Recent studies described a combination of these pathological lesions with the presence of AIP in the caudodorsal lungs and BP in the cranioventral lungs of necropsied cattle. This pulmonary pathology has been described as bronchopneumonia with an interstitial pneumonia (BIP). The epidemiological characteristics of BIP in U.S. feedyard cattle are yet to be described. This study's objectives were to describe the agreement between feedyard clinical and necropsy gross diagnosis and to characterize epidemiological factors associated with four gross pulmonary diagnoses (AIP, BIP, BP, and Normal pulmonary tissue) observed during feedyard cattle necropsies. Systemic necropsies were performed at six feedyards in U.S. high plains region, and gross pulmonary diagnoses were established. Historical data were added to the dataset, including sex, days on feed at death (DOFDEATH), arrival weight, treatment count, and feedyard diagnosis. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate epidemiological factors associated with the probability of each pulmonary pathology. Comparing feedyard clinical diagnosis with gross pathological diagnosis revealed relatively low agreement and the frequency of agreement varied by diagnosis. The likelihood of AIP at necropsy was higher for heifers than steers and in the 100-150 DOFDEATH category compared with the 0-50 DOFDEATH (p = 0.05). The likelihood of BIP increased after the first treatment, whereas the DOFDEATH 0-50 category had a lower likelihood compared with the 150-200 category (p = 0.05). These findings highlight the importance of necropsy for final diagnosis and can aid the development of future diagnosis and therapeutic protocols for pulmonary diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The roles of microbiota in reproduction are complex and critical for animal health. But little is known currently about the microbiome of plateau Bangor Sewa sheep. The purpose of this study was to discover the changes in the genital tract microbiota of pre- and post-partum Bangor Sewa sheep. (2) Methods: Samples from the birth canal were obtained for 16S rRNA sequencing, three days before and after delivery, respectively. (3) Results: The results showed that there was a noticeable difference in three phyla and 74 genera between the pre- and post-parturition groups in the microbiota of Bangor Sewa sheep. The changes included a decrease in the abundance of genera related to health (unclassified_Cellulomonadaceae, Cellulomonas, Fibrobacti, Flavobacterium, Eubacterium_ventriosum_group, Acetitomaculum, Aeromicrobium, Dietzia, Romboutsia, Ruminococcus, etc.) and an increased abundance of negatively related genera (Nocardioides, unclassified_Clostridia, Sphingobacteriaceae, unclassified_Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae_UCG_004, Micromonospora, Streptococcus, Facklamia, Bosea, etc.) spp. (4) Conclusions: Microbes can serve as indicators of the physical state of Bangor Sewa sheep. These findings laid the foundation for deciphering the effects of microbial changes during birth on the reproductive health of plateau Bangor Sewa sheep.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Previous studies mainly focused on the microbiota of feces and worldwide farmed commercial pigs, while research on the microbiota of various intestinal sections and indigenous pig breeds is very limited. This study aimed to characterize and compare the biogeography of intestinal microbiota in pigs of one Chinese indigenous breed and one commercial crossbred. In this study, we sequenced the microbiota of six intestinal segments in the grown-up pigs of a Chinese indigenous breed, Laiwu pigs, and the worldwide farmed crossbred Duroc &#215; Landrace &#215; Yorkshire (DLY) pigs by 16S rRNA sequencing, characterized the biogeography of intestinal microbiota, and compared the compositional and functional differences between the two breeds. The results showed that there were obvious differences in microbial structure and abundance between the small and large intestines. Laiwu pigs had higher large intestinal diversity than DLY pigs, while DLY pigs had higher small intestinal diversity than Laiwu pigs. Moreover, some specific bacterial taxa and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were found to be related to the high fat deposition and good meat quality of Laiwu pigs and the high growth speed and lean meat rate of DLY pigs. This study provides an insight into the shifts in taxonomic composition, microbial diversity, and functional profile of intestinal microbiota in six intestinal segments of Laiwu and DLY pigs, which would be essential for exploring the potential influence of the host's genetic background on variation in microbiota composition and diversity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The challenge in diagnosis of guttural pouch diseases lies in the complex anatomy of the guttural pouch and adjacent associated structures. Diagnostic imaging is a good complement to endoscopy for the diagnosis of some guttural pouch diseases, especially to make a full assessment of the lesions involving the pouch and surrounding structures. This review article describes the value of each diagnostic imaging technique in the diagnosis of guttural pouch disease and the corresponding imaging findings. Radiography is generally used as the first line to complement endoscopic findings, and can give useful additional information although it is limited by superimposition. Ultrasonographic examination of the guttural pouch is of limited value due to the presence of gas in the guttural pouch but can eventually be used to detect fluid within the pouch or can help to evaluate the soft tissues located lateral and ventral to the guttural pouch. Cross-sectional imaging, especially CT, is increasingly available and appears to be the best technique to fully assess the surrounding soft tissues and to precisely identify lesions of the temporohyoid apparatus, temporal bone and skull base that are associated with guttural pouch disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, third-year veterinary students were trained in three canine dental core skills using either a high-fidelity model (Group A) or video instruction (Group B). An objective structured clinical examination was used to assess skill acquisition and questionnaires were distributed in order to assess student confidence and perceptions related to small-animal dentistry practice and related skills before and after the training. All results were compared between the two groups. Group A outperformed Group B in skill acquisition (p &lt; 0.001) and there was greater improvement in skill confidence for Group A than Group B (p &lt; 0.001). There was no statistical difference in perceptions related to small-animal dentistry between the two groups after the training (p &#8805; 0.1). Group A rated their training experience more highly than Group B (p &lt; 0.001). Although dental skill acquisition shows greater improvement when training is provided by models rather than video instruction, a blended approach to teaching dental skills is likely to be the best approach to optimizing dental skill acquisition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The diagnosis of severe equine asthma (SEA) (historically referred as recurrent airway obstruction or RAO) is based mainly on the history of the animal and clinical signs, which are further supported by the cytological examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This can also be helpful in monitoring the inflammation of the lower airways in response to environmental management and medication. The cytocentrifugated preparation is usually considered the method of choice for BAL cytological interpretation. The aim of this study was to compare the results in terms of differential cell counts (DCC) in BAL cytology performed on sedimented smears and cytocentrifugated preparations. To carry this out, 48 BAL samples were collected from six horses with SEA that were subjected to a process of exacerbation of the disease by environmental stimuli, which was later followed by the appropriate treatment. Each collected BAL fluid was equally divided into duplicate portions: one processed by cytocentrifugation and one by sediment smear from simple centrifugation. Cytologic examination of all BAL by both methods showed poor concordance in DCC, although it was still able to allow diagnostic recognition of severe lung neutrophilic disorders. These results suggest that sediment smear preparation, although remaining a useful method in general equine practice associated with clinical assessments in the diagnosis of SEA under conditions where there is no possibility of using a cytocentrifuge, cannot be considered a comparable alternative.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four practical trials were performed to evaluate the transition of SAA and sialic acid before and after dehorning, the relationship between the SAA concentration and other blood test parameters, the SAA dynamics in the diseased cattle, and the blood test results, including the SAA concentrations, of the two cases with a follow-up. The SAA concentration increased with dehorning but decreased 7 days after dehorning. The SAA concentration is positively correlated with the &#945;-globulin, sialic acid, and fibrinogen concentrations and negatively correlated with the serum iron concentration. The SAA concentration in the deceased herd was significantly higher than that in the cured outcome herd. In addition, the SAA concentration in the cured group decreased significantly from the first test to retesting but increased significantly in the disuse group. Thus, SAA is a sensitive index of inflammation and a monitoring tool in Japanese Black cattle, and its measurement is considered useful in clinical practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this retrospective multi-institutional study was to assess the efficacy of meloxicam in combination with mitoxantrone or vinblastine as a first-line treatment for non-resectable canine UCC. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs) of these treatment combinations were also assessed. A total of 28 dogs met the inclusion criteria, 21/28 dogs received mitoxantrone and meloxicam, and 7/28 received vinblastine and meloxicam. Tumour response (TR) and AE were evaluated according to Veterinary Co-Operative Oncology Group (VCOG) criteria. The endpoint of the study was the time to tumour progression (TTP). The mitoxantrone-group induced 24% partial response and 62% stable disease, while the vinblastine-group induced 14% and 86%, respectively. Median TTP was 84 days (mitoxantrone and meloxicam, 70 days; and vinblastine and meloxicam, 178 days). The presence of metastatic disease significantly decreased TTP (p = 0.007). Gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 21.4% of the patients, with the most common being VCOG grade 1-2 diarrhoea. Meloxicam is a well-tolerated NSAID when combined with mitoxantrone or vinblastine as first-line treatment for non-resectable canine UCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The isolates were first identified as S. microti by MALDI-TOF MS, but later whole genome sequencing analysis allowed reclassification as S. rostri. The isolates were derived from 52 cows and nine dairy herds in Denmark. To describe the pathogenicity of S. rostri, we used whole genome sequencing to infer the distribution of genes associated with virulence, antibiotic resistance, and mobile genetic elements. Also, we performed a core-genome phylogeny analysis to study the genetic relatedness among the isolates. All 81 isolates expressed the same virulence profile comprising two putative virulence genes, clpP and clpC. Three isolates carried a resistance gene encoding streptomycin (str) or lincomycin (lnuA) resistance. The distribution of plasmids suggested the detected antibiotic resistance genes to be plasmid-mediated. Phages were abundant among the isolates, and the single isolate from clinical mastitis acquired a phage disparate from the rest, which potentially could be involved with virulence in S. rostri. The core genome phylogeny revealed a strong genetic intra-herd conservation, which indicates the source of introduction being herd-specific and might further imply the ability of S. rostri to adapt to the bovine niche and spread from cow-to-cow in a contagious manner. With this study, we aim to acquaint clinicians and professionals with the existence of S. rostri which might have been overlooked so far.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study evaluated the possible adverse effects of administering oral therapeutic firocoxib on gastric mucosa, hematological parameters, coagulation cascade, and hepatic and renal biochemistry in healthy horses. Nine clinically healthy Arabian horses, approximately 9 years old, received 0.1 mg/kg of oral firocoxib for 14 days. The gastroscopic examination was conducted 1 day before starting treatment (D0) and two days after the last blood collection (D23). Venous blood samples were obtained for laboratory tests on day 1, immediately prior to the initiation of treatment (D1), after 7 and 14 days of treatment (D7 and D14), and 7 days after the conclusion of treatment (D21. No changes were found in the gastroscopic and hematological tests. Coagulation and serum biochemistry levels remain between these species' average values. However, the increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) indicate reduced blood coagulation capacity, which contradicts the expected effect of treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors, as these drugs theoretically promote coagulation. Administering firocoxib to horses is safe as it does not cause significant adverse reactions. Therefore, it is a suitable option for managing inflammatory conditions in these animals with attention to an unexpected adverse anti-coagulopathy effect, and further study is warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different biomarkers associated with this inflammatory response have been evaluated in experimentally induced equine placentitis, but not in pregnant mares with spontaneous placentitis. The aim of the current study was to determine the concentration of eIL-1&#946; and the activity of proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 in the serum of healthy mares and mares with placentitis on days 240 and 320 of gestation to explore whether these biomarkers are associated with equine maternal placentitis and/or with the birth of an infected or inviable foals. Serum samples were collected from sixteen pregnant English Thoroughbred mares, retrospectively classified as follows: (1) healthy mares with full-term gestation; and (2) mares with ultrasonographic signs of placentitis. The health of each foal was examined at birth, and it was decided to classify the cases into four groups: (1) healthy mares delivering a healthy foals (HM-HF, n = 6); (2) mares with USP delivering a healthy foal (USP-HF, n = 3); (3) mares with USP delivering a live septic foal (USP-LSeF, n = 4); and (4) mares with USP delivering a dead foal (USP-DF, n = 3). eIL-1&#946; was quantified by ELISA, and proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 activity by gelatin zymography electrophoresis. In healthy mares, the serum concentrations of eIL-1&#946; underwent a significant 16.5-fold increase from day 240 to day 320 of gestation. Although similar results were found in the mares with ultrasonographic signs of placentitis that delivered a healthy foal, those delivering a live septic or nonviable foal exhibited much higher concentrations of eIL-1&#946;. proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 activity was not associated with maternal placentitis, foal infection, or death. Hence, the presence of placentitis severe enough to affect the health of the foal can be confirmed or discarded by determining the eIL-1&#946; concentration in mares that have shown ultrasonographic signs of placentitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Herein, we describe our experience with two dogs (a 3-year-old intact female toy poodle and a 5-year-old spayed female toy poodle) that developed neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intracranial disseminated lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed pleocytosis and B-cell monoclonal proliferation in both cases. PCNSL or secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) was diagnosed on the basis of MRI findings and CSF examinations. Nimustine (ACNU) is a nitrosourea alkylating agent, a class of drugs that includes lomustine. Nimustine is mainly used to treat human intracranial neoplasia because of its high permeability across the blood-brain barrier. The dogs in this study were treated with combined chemotherapy comprising nimustine and prednisolone, which achieved complete or nearly complete remission of neurological symptoms and long-term survival (&gt;2583 days and 1218 days), but with problematic adverse effects. We determined that the dose of nimustine for canine PCNSL or SCNSL with intravenous infusion was 25-30 mg/m[2] every 3-4 weeks for a total of four times; however, the data were insufficient to determine the optimal regimen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fundus examination can allow the monitoring of morphological retinal changes in the progression of photocoagulation lesions, without offering details on the morphological changes by the retinal lesion. The aim of the study was to assess the progression of photocoagulation lesions induced by transscleral retinopexy (840 nm diode laser), by comparing the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histological images over a period of six weeks on eight pigmented New Zealand healthy rabbits (four males and four females; n = 16 eyes). All rabbits underwent transscleral retinopexy on their left eye on day 0 (D0). Measurements of the photocoagulation lesions were obtained in vivo on D0, D7, D15, D21, and D42 by acquiring OCT images of both eyes from all rabbits. On D1, D7, D21, and D42, two rabbits were euthanized, and their eyes were enucleated. A significant effect by time on the decrease in the central retinal thickness of the photocoagulation lesion was observed from D1 to D7 (p = 0.001); however, no such effect was observed on the horizontal length ((HL) p = 0.584) of the lesion surface. The reliability between the OCT and histological measurements, which were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients, was excellent for measuring the retinal thickness at the center (ICC = 0.91, p &lt; 0.001), moderate for the right side of the retinal lesions (ICC = 0.72, p = 0.006), and not significant for the left side and HL (p = 0.055 and 0.500, respectively). The morphological changes observed in the OCT and histopathological images of the photocoagulation lesions were qualitatively described over time. OCT is an effective tool for monitoring changes in photocoagulation lesions. Some measurements and qualitative changes showed an adequate correlation between the OCT and histological findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Understanding the viral tropism during the initial, subclinical phase of infection is critical to develop targeted vaccines and therapeutics. With the continued emergence of variants of concern, particularly those that appear to have a tropism for the upper respiratory tract, understanding the complete pathogenesis is critical to develop more effective interventions. Thus far, the Syrian hamster has served as the most consistent small animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection for mild to moderate respiratory disease. Herein, we utilize histopathology and immunohistochemistry to characterize the peracute phase of disease initiating at 6-h-post-inoculation in the intranasal inoculation route Syrian hamster model. Inflammation and viral replication initiates in the respiratory epithelium of nasal turbinates as early as 12-h-post-inoculation and moves caudally through the nasal cavity by 36-h-post inoculation. Lower respiratory involvement can be detected as early as 12-h-post inoculation in the intranasal inoculated hamster model. These data highlight the importance of rostral nasal cavity sampling at early timepoints for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster model.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this primer is to assist veterinary educators in appraising and potentially adopting these rapid upcoming advances in data science and technology. In the first section, we introduce ML concepts and highlight similarities/differences between ML and classical statistics. In the second section, we provide a step-by-step worked example using simulated veterinary student data to answer a hypothesis-driven question. Python syntax with explanations is provided within the text to create a random forest ML prediction model, a model composed of decision trees with each decision tree being composed of nodes and leaves. Within each step of the model creation, specific considerations such as how to manage incomplete student records are highlighted when applying ML algorithms within the veterinary education field. The results from the simulated data demonstrate how decisions by the veterinary educator during ML model creation may impact the most important features contributing to the model. These results highlight the need for the veterinary educator to be fully transparent during the creation of ML models and future research is needed to establish guidelines for handling data not missing at random in medical education, and preferred methods for model evaluation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756060</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Nurturing a Respectful Connection: Exploring the Relationship between University Educators and Students in a Spanish Veterinary Faculty.</Title>	<Abstract>The respect of the teacher for the student is essential for effective teaching from the perspective of the students, even in comparison to the knowledge and communication capacity of the teacher. Consequently, the optimal development of this characteristic fosters a more effective and efficient student-teacher relationship. We initiated this research following a conversation with a group of university students, who expressed their discontent regarding the lack of respect shown towards them by some teachers. Therefore, we conducted a descriptive study using online surveys, focusing on the central axis in the teacher-student relationship. The results highlighted the need for faculty members to analyze and question their attitudes towards their students. This paper presents initial results of the data collected at the Veterinary Faculty of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756061</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Use of Tricaine Methanesulfonate (MS-222) in Asian Seabass (Lates calcarifer) at Different Temperatures: Study of Optimal Doses, Minimum Effective Concentration, Blood Biochemistry, Immersion Pharmacokinetics, and Tissue Distributions.</Title>	<Abstract>This study was conducted to determine the optimal doses and minimum effective concentrations (MECs) of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) in marketable-size Asian seabass reared at two temperatures (22 and 28 &#176;C). Serum biochemical parameters, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distributions of MS-222 following immersion at the determined optimal doses were also evaluated in order to delineate possible mechanisms dictating the temperature difference. The definition of optimal dose is set as the dose when fish attain stage III anesthesia within 5 min, sustain this stage for 3 min, and re-attain equilibrium within 5 min. The MEC is the fish serum MS-222 concentration when stage III anesthesia is reached. The results showed that water temperature exerted no or minimal impact on the designated parameters. The optimal doses at 22 and 28 &#176;C were 140 and 150 &#181;g/mL, while the MECs were 70.48 and 78.27 &#181;g/mL, respectively. Fish exposed to the optimal doses of MS-222 had significantly elevated blood concentrations of lactate, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and sodium, while the blood pH was significantly decreased. The fish eliminated MS-222 faster at 28 &#176;C than at 22 &#176;C, with serum half-lives of 18.43 and 37.01 h, respectively. Tissue-specific distribution patterns were evident. Irrespective of water temperature, MS-222 peaked at 5 min for the brain and gill but peaked slightly later at 10-20 min for the liver and kidney. Most tissues exhibit a gradual decline of drug concentration except for the gill, which was maintained at a steady level. Muscle is the least perfused tissue with the lowest drug concentration throughout the 90 min period. This study provided physiological and pharmacokinetic evidence contributing to a better understanding of the actions of MS-222 in Asian seabass at different temperatures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, a general growing interest in this unique organ prompted the expansion of IVD research in rats, rabbits, cats, horses, monkeys, and cows, further illuminating the complex nature of the organ in both healthy and degenerative states. Application of recent biotechnological advancements, including single cell RNA sequencing and complex data analysis methods has begun to explain the shifting inflammatory signaling, variation in cellular subpopulations, differential gene expression, mechanical loading, and metabolic stresses which contribute to age and stress related degeneration of the IVD. This increase in IVD research across species introduces a need for chronicling IVD advancements and tissue biomarkers both within and between species. Here we provide a comprehensive review of recent single cell RNA sequencing data alongside existing case reports and histo/morphological data to highlight the cellular complexity and metabolic challenges of this unique organ that is of structural importance for all vertebrates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756063</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Negative Influence of Aging on Differentiation and Proliferation of CD8[+] T-Cells in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Immunosenescence is an age-related change in the immune system characterized by a reduction in na&#239;ve T-cells and an impaired proliferative capacity of CD8[+] T-cells in older individuals. Recent research revealed the crucial impact of immunosenescence on the development and control of cancer, and aging is one of the causes that diminish the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapies targeting CD8[+] T-cell activation. Despite dog cancer being defined as an age-related disease, there are few fundamental understandings regarding the relationship between aging and the canine immune system. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the characteristics of immunosenescence in dogs and analyzed the effects of aging on the differentiation status and proliferation of canine CD8[+] T cells using T-cell specific stimulation with anti-canine CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads and interleukin-2. As a result, we found that older dogs have a lower proliferative capacity of CD8[+] T-cells and a reduction in the na&#239;ve subset in their peripheral blood. Further analysis showed that older dogs had attenuated proliferation of the effector and central memory subsets. These results indicate the importance of maintaining less differentiated subsets to expand CD8[+] T-cells in dogs and provide helpful insight into the development of dog immune therapies that require T-cell expansion ex vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This area is extremely complex, and its description remains a real challenge for veterinary anatomists and practitioners. Six clinically normal equine cadavers were employed. Conventional dissections of guttural pouches without penetrating the guttural pouch membrane were first performed, and each adjacent structure was identified. Then, a guttural pouch endoscopic exam of the dissected heads was performed in order to correctly map each visible underlying anatomic structure identified in the previous dissection. This allowed us to: 1-identify each structure visible on endoscopic examination of the guttural pouch; 2-create a representative map of all the structures accurately identified via endoscopy; and 3-describe a systematic guttural pouch endoscopic examination with practical keys to help identification of the underlying vital structures. Our investigation provides new practical information on guttural pouch endoscopic anatomy and has allowed us to identify structures that were not previously described. We believe that this information may help with an accurate diagnosis in some cases and also potentially reduce iatrogenic trauma to important structures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, our understanding of cell types and molecular mechanisms in the early embryo development of Mongolian sheep has been hampered. This study presents the first comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic characterization at E16 in Ujumqin sheep and Hulunbuir short-tailed sheep. Thirteen major cell types were identified at E16 in Ujumqin sheep, and eight major cell types were identified at E16 in Hulunbuir short-tailed sheep. Function enrichment analysis showed that several pathways were significantly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, the platelet activation pathway, the riboflavin metabolism pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and the insulin signaling pathway in the notochord cluster. Glutathione metabolism, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism, the citrate cycle, thyroid hormone synthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, thermogenesis, and the VEGF signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the spinal cord cluster. Steroid biosynthesis, riboflavin metabolism, the cell cycle, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Hedgehog signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the paraxial mesoderm cluster. The notochord cluster, spinal cord cluster, and paraxial mesoderm cluster were found to be highly associated with tail development. Pseudo-time analysis demonstrated that the mesenchyme can translate to the notochord in Ujumqin sheep. Molecular assays revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway was enriched in Ujumqin sheep. This comprehensive single-cell map revealed previously unrecognized signaling pathways that will further our understanding of the mechanism of short-tailed sheep formation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756066</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Failure of Passive Immunity Transfer Is Not a Risk Factor for Omphalitis in Beef Calves.</Title>	<Abstract>Omphalitis is the third most frequent disease in newborn calves after neonatal diarrhea and bovine respiratory disease (BRD), but limited data on the prevalence and risk factors are available in the literature. Failure of passive immunity transfer (FPIT) is recognized as a major risk factor for diseases and mortality in calves. However, the association between omphalitis and FPIT remains poorly described. To assess this association, 964 suckler beef calves from 22 farms were included in a longitudinal cohort study for 5 months. Each calf was examined twice (mean ages: 4.4 and 11.1 days old) to diagnose omphalitis through clinical examination and ultrasonographic evaluation (USE) if necessary. Measurements of the total solids percentage (TS-%Brix) and total protein (TP) were performed on the serum during the first visit to evaluate the calves' passive immunity status. FPIT (fair and poor) was defined as serum %Brix &lt; 8.1 or TP &lt; 5.1 g/dL; among calves with omphalitis, 14% had FPIT and among calves without omphalitis 12% had FPIT. The omphalitis prevalence was 32.3% in calves without any other disease (overall prevalence of 30.9%). No statistical association between the prevalence of omphalitis and FPIT was observed. Further research is needed to identify the risk factors and promote the prevention measures for omphalitis in cow-calf systems, such as calving difficulty, hygiene of housing, and navel disinfection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756067</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Is the Introduction into a New Environment Stressful for Young Bulls?</Title>	<Abstract>Several events in an animal's life are considered stressful. Among them, the most studied and significant are transportation, weaning, and adaptation to climate change. Moreover, other events, such as the separation from the dam, moving from the original farm to another, management practices, such as regrouping with other animals, and new hierarchical conditions, represent routine conditions in the bovine's life, which can influence the animal's homeostasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in blood parameters of 45 calves introduced into a new environment from their original farms. Blood samples were collected upon arrival at a genetic center (T1), 7 (T2), 30 (T3), and 120 (T4) days after arrival. Blood count, protein electrophoresis, clinical chemistry, and innate immunity parameters were performed on the samples. Significant alterations in some clinical chemistry parameters were related to liver function in the serum protein and the values of IL-6 and TNF-&#945;; the main cytokines mediating the stress response emerged from the results. The evidence indicates the mild response to adaptation stress by calves raised in close association with people after their introduction into a new environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, this approach is accompanied by a long-term loss of production. With adequate control measures, such as well-designed immunization programs and technological changes along with prevalence-based laboratory testing, the virus-free status of the most vulnerable age groups in swine herds can be achieved. The most common reason for acquiring PRRSV at large farrow-to-finish swine farm units is that the previously settled fattening pigs serve as a source of infection for the newly reared PRRS-free animals. Following such unwanted events, PRRSV may persist in an affected establishment for several years. In this observational study, we selected four farrow-to-finish type swine herds. We implemented different laboratory testing protocols to find the most optimal solution for a successful PRRS elimination program. To aid our objectives, we used a DIVA PCR technique. The PRRS DIVA PCR assay is a fast, reliable method to identify sows shedding farm-specific PRRSV strain(s). As a result of elimination efforts at the sentinel pig herds, we found that reliable detection of wild-type PRRSV shedding among sows requires sampling at least three weaned piglets per litter. The strict adherence to this sampling protocol, the systematic use of laboratory methods that quickly detect the presence of wild virulent virus in the herd during the rearing period and the culling of DIVA PCR positive litters and their sows decreased the presence of the resident virus markedly. These procedures at Hungarian farrow-to-finish type farms successfully inhibited the wild-type PRRSV infection of different age groups. The results of this study demonstrate that applying this methodology together with strict biosecurity measures enabled us to reach PRRS-vaccinated-free status in large, farrow-to-finish herds within two years.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756069</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Macroscopic Skin Examination Can Determine the Number of Strips Necessary to Study the stratum corneum in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>To evaluate the skin barrier, the stratum corneum (SC) must be isolated and extracted. Currently, skin biopsy is the gold standard method to investigate skin immunology and the presence of biomarkers in dogs. However, a standardized, non-invasive tool to exclusively remove the SC would be of great interest to study healthy and atopic dogs. In this study, we performed D-squames[&#174;] tape stripping with standardized pressure on seven healthy beagle dogs. A control site was defined and then 25 strips, 50 strips and as many strips as needed to achieve a shiny appearance of the skin were performed on three different experimental sites. After stripping, blinded histopathological examination of a skin biopsy from each site was performed. The number of tape strips required for the skin to become shiny varied between individuals, with a mean of 40 (29-50) strips. There was no significant difference in SC depth between the control site and the site that underwent 25 tape strips. In contrast, the use of 50 strips removed almost all of the SC, with a mean remaining SC depth of 7.82 &#181;m. These data suggest that this non-invasive method can effectively remove the SC, with individual variability, and that a shiny appearance of the skin after stripping can be used as an accurate marker of SC removal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The use of inhaled corticosteroids is less widespread than oral ones. This study aims to compare the effects of oral and inhaled corticosteroids in dogs with cough and TC. Thirty dogs were prospectively included and randomized to the prednisone oral group (OG, 14) or fluticasone inhaled group (IG, 16). A clinical score (CS) based on four clinical parameters (respiratory distress, cough episodes, cough frequency, tracheal sensitivity) was monitored at the hospital (enrolment and weeks 2 and 4). Water intake, urination habits, and adherence and tolerance to treatments were monitored weekly. Significant improvements in clinical parameters were identified in both groups throughout the study. Between-group (OG-IG) comparisons revealed no significant differences, indicating equivalent improvement. At the study's endpoint, the IG dogs had a significantly lower CS (5.69 &#177; 0.79) than OG dogs (6.43 &#177; 1.02, p &lt; 0.05). Adherence and tolerance were comparable. From weeks 2 to 4, OG dogs were significantly thirstier and urinated more frequently than IG dogs. In conclusion, fluticasone provided good tolerability and efficacy in controlling cough in dogs with TC, and they showed a lower incidence of signs of hypercortisolism compared to prednisone. These data encourage the use of inhaled fluticasone in dogs with cough and TC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Insects may harbour microorganisms both in the gut and on the exoskeleton originating from the rearing environment. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic microorganism frequently involved in food poisoning due to its enterotoxin production. This study aimed to evaluate the S. aureus growth and enterotoxins production following an experimental inoculation into the T. molitor rearing substrate (about 7 log CFU/g). Analyses on the substrate and larvae were performed over a testing period of seven days. The microbial population dynamics were also evaluated through total viable count and lactic acid bacteria count. The effects of fasting, washing, and cooking on the microbial loads of mealworms were evaluated. The results highlighted that mealworms and substrates can maintain their microbial loads of S. aureus over the tested period. Moreover, fasting and washing were generally not able to significantly reduce (p-value &gt; 0.05) S. aureus count in mealworms. On the other hand, cooking significantly reduced (p-value &lt; 0.001) the microbial load in almost all cases. No production of enterotoxins was revealed during the trial. Therefore, microbiological risks can be reduced by a wise choice of substrate, appropriate control measures, and thermal treatment of larvae.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756072</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Effect of Month and District on 100-Day In-Calf Rate in Year-Round Calving Dairy Herds.</Title>	<Abstract>Monitoring 100-day in-calf rate (100DICR) is an integral part of the assessment of reproductive performance in year-round calving dairy herds. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of month on 100DICR in year-round calving herds in New South Wales (NSW), Australia and determine whether a fluctuating 100DICR target is an appropriate alternative to a constant 100DICR target. The 100DICR is defined as the percentage of all current lactating cows over 100 days in milk (DIM) that conceive on or before 100 DIM. As dairy cows are typically dried off 7 months after conception, 100DICR was an approximate 7-month rolling average. Mean monthly 100DICRs were calculated with a generalised linear model for six NSW north coast herds located 15-140 km from the coast and four NSW south coast herds located less than 10 km from the coast, over a two-year period. The mean 100DICR was lowest in May at 28.62% (95%CI 28.31-28.93) and increased during winter and spring, peaking in December at 34.74% (95%CI 34.32-35.15). The observed trend was similar for north and south coast herds, although north coast herds experienced a greater change in 100DICR from the peak to a nadir of 27.58% (95%CI 27.18-27.98), a 7.15-point difference, compared to south coast herds with a nadir of 30.18% (95%CI 29.69-30.67), a 4.67-point difference between the peak and nadir. In conclusion, 100DICR is affected by month with the lowest 100DICRs observed in late autumn and the highest 100DICRs observed in late spring and early summer. Therefore, a fluctuating target 100DICR is an appropriate alternative to a constant target when assessing reproductive performance in year-round calving herds. While the district does not affect mean 100DICR per se, the district does affect the difference between peak and nadir 100DICR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of BCS after parturition in stages of lactation (30 and 60 days) on the milk quality of Najdi ewes. The ewes were milked in the morning after their lambs had been isolated. Milk composition and fatty acid profiles (FA) were analyzed at 30 and 60 days of lactation after assessment of the sheep's body condition. The sheep were classified into the following body conditions: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. Sheep milk contained significant (p &lt; 0.05) levels of protein at a BCS of 3.5 and on day 60 of lactation. The ewes with a BCS of 2.5 had a high milk content (p &lt; 0.05) of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), oleic acid (OA), vaccenic acid (VA), and LA at day 60 of lactation. This result shows that the ewes with a BCS of 2.5 were able to produce high-quality milk, and 60 days of lactation was the preferred time for producing good milk and tasty and healthy dairy products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of CFP compared to traditional ingredients on the fecal microbiota of dogs. The four experimental diets included a control with no yeast and diets containing either 3.5% brewer's dried yeast, 2.5% brewer's dried yeast plus 17.5% distiller's dried grains with solubles, or 17.5% CFP. The experimental diets were fed to adult dogs (n = 12) in a 4 &#215; 4 replicated Latin square design. Fresh fecal samples (n = 48) were analyzed by 16S metagenomic sequencing. Raw sequences were processed through mothur. Community diversity was evaluated in R. Relative abundance data were analyzed within the 50 most abundant operational taxonomic units using a mixed model of SAS. Alpha and beta diversity were similar for all treatments. Predominant phyla among all samples were Firmicutes (73%), Bacteroidetes (15%), Fusobacteria (8%), and Actinobacteria (4%). There were no quantifiable (p &gt; 0.05) shifts in the predominant phyla among the treatments. However, nine genera resulted in differences in relative abundance among the treatments. These data indicate that compared to traditional ingredients, CFP did not alter the overall diversity of the fecal microbiota of healthy adult dogs over 14 days.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Their prevalence in heavy pigs reared for premium products (e.g., Parma ham) requires further investigation. Stress, nutrition, and farm management are known risk factors, but the effects of steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of gastric lesions in Italian heavy pigs and their possible association with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. A total of 9371 pig stomachs from 76 farms were evaluated. Among these, 20.3% showed no lesions, while 30.7%, 42.1%, and 6.8% were scored 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A tendency for an inverse relationship with farm size emerged. The use of steroids and NSAIDs was estimated by calculating a treatment incidence per 1000 (TI1000) in a subset of 36 farms. At least one prescription for NSAIDs and/or steroids was found in 80.6% of the farms (55.6% used NSAIDs and 63.9% used steroids). Median TI1000 was 0.07 (range: 0-30.1) and 0.18 (range: 0-6.2) for NSAIDs and steroids, respectively. Gastric scores were positively associated with NSAID use, but not with steroid use. Although the role of these drugs in gastric lesions needs to be further clarified, these findings suggest a cautious use of non-selective NSAIDs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty female Italian Holstein calves (37.14 &#177; 2.72 kg) born between February and July were studied from the day of birth until 77 days of age. From the fourth day of life, they were fed 3 L/day of pasteurized milk twice daily and supplemented with the same hay-based TMR. The data on feed intake, fecal characteristics, and growth performances were collected and showed that these calves had adequate parameters. Moreover, the data collected was used to create equations to predict body weight and solid feed intake using a mixed model. The goodness of fit of the developed equations was evaluated by coefficients of determinations (R[2]). The equation obtained shows high R[2] (0.98 for solid feed intake and 0.99 for calf weight), indicating the satisfactory precision and accuracy needed to predict female calves' body weight and solid feed intake.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756077</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Single Intra-Articular Injection of Platelet-Rich Plasma vs. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs as Treatment Options for Canine Cruciate Ligament Rupture and Patellar Luxation.</Title>	<Abstract>Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) and patellar luxation (PL) are common pathologies affecting canines. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as a non-surgical treatment plan in these cases. Clinical usage of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an emerging area of interest in veterinary medicine. There is a lack of studies comparing those two different treatment methods in veterinary medicine. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the use of oral NSAIDs and single intra-articular injection of PRP on treatment outcomes in cases of canine CCLR and PL. Dogs diagnosed with CCRL (n = 12) and PL (n = 10) were subgrouped by the severity of pathologies and administered treatment: half of the CCRL and PL groups were orally administered NSAIDs and supplements for 14 days, and the other half received a single intra-articular PRP injection into affected stifle joint. We measured serum TNF-&#945; levels and clinical outcomes (lameness scores, painfulness to manipulations, goniometry of stifle joint in flexion and extension, and muscle strength) before treatment, at day 14 and day 28 of treatment. The results of TNF-&#945; concentration indicates a significant difference between groups of differently treated partial CCLR groups on d14 (p = 0.006). Results of group CCLR-P1 on d14 were decreased, while results of group CCLR-P2 on d14 were increased. When comparing TNF-&#945; concentration between all CCLR cases treated with NSAIDs and treated with PRP, there was a significant difference between those groups on d14 (p = 0.001). The results of TNF-&#945; concentration indicates a significant difference between groups of differently treated PL-III on d28 (p = 0.036). Results of group PL-III1 indicate growth of TNF-&#945; concentration, while at the same d28, results of group PL-III2 indicate decreased levels of cytokine, comparing results between the subgroups at the same time point and within subgroups from baseline. Results indicate a significant difference in muscle strength between group CCLR-P1 and group CCLR-P2 on d28 (p = 0.007), indicating an increment in muscle strength in group CCLR-P1 up to d14 and its reduction up to d28, and muscle strength of group CCLR-P2 increasing up to d28. When comparing the muscle strength between all CCLR cases treated with NSAIDs and treated with PRP, there was a significant difference between those groups on d28 (p = 0.007). In conclusion, a single intra-articular injection of PRP has a superior effect on management of inflammatory processes, has better clinical outcomes, and longer duration of action than oral NSAIDs, in the treatment of canine CCRL or PL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756078</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Marine Microalgae as a Nutritive Tool to Mitigate Ruminal Greenhouse Gas Production: In Vitro Fermentation Characteristics of Fresh and Ensiled Maize (Zea mays L.) Forage.</Title>	<Abstract>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of marine microalgae (Dunaliella salina) as a food additive on biogas (BG), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production kinetics, as well as in in vitro rumen fermentation and the CH4 conversion efficiency of different genotypes of maize (Zea mays L.) and states of forage. The treatments were characterized by the forage of five maize genotypes (Amarillo, Montesa, Olotillo, Tampique&#241;o, and Tuxpe&#241;o), two states of forage (fresh and ensiled), and the addition of 3% (on DM basis) of microalgae (with and without). The parameters (b = asymptotic production, c = production rate, and Lag = delay phase before gas production) of the production of BG, CH4, CO, and H2S showed an effect (p &lt; 0.05) of the genotype, the state of the forage, the addition of the microalgae, or some of its interactions, except for the time in the CO delay phase (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, the addition of microalgae decreased (p &lt; 0.05) the production of BG, CH4, and H2S in most of the genotypes and stages of the forage, but the production of CO increased (p &lt; 0.05). In the case of fermentation characteristics, the microalgae increased (p &lt; 0.05) the pH, DMD, SCFA, and ME in most genotypes and forage states. With the addition of the microalgae, the fresh forage from Olotillo obtained the highest pH (p &lt; 0.05), and the ensiled from Amarillo, the highest (p &lt; 0.05) DMD, SCFA, and ME. However, the ensiled forage produced more (p &lt; 0.05) CH4 per unit of SFCA, ME, and OM, and the microalgae increased it (p &lt; 0.05) even more, and the fresh forage from Amarillo presented the highest (p &lt; 0.05) quantity of CH4 per unit of product. In conclusion, the D. salina microalga showed a potential to reduce the production of BG, CH4, and H2S in maize forage, but its effect depended on the chemical composition of the genotype and the state of the forage. Despite the above, the energy value of the forage (fresh and ensiled) improved, the DMD increased, and in some cases, SCFA and ME also increased, all without compromising CH4 conversion efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Such infections are usually cured by using antimicrobials and lead to develop resistance. Until now, there has been no effective vaccine to eradicate the disease. This study used conserved domains found in seven members of the variable lipoprotein (VlpA-G) family in order to design a multi-epitope candidate vaccine (MEV) against M. hyorhinis. The immunoinformatics approach was followed to predict epitopes, and a vaccine construct consisting of an adjuvant, two B cell epitopes, two HTL epitopes, and one CTL epitope was designed. The suitability of the vaccine construct was identified by its non-allergen, non-toxic, and antigenic nature. A molecular dynamic simulation was executed to assess the stability of the TLR2 docked structure. An immune simulation showed a high immune response toward the antigen. The protein sequence was reverse-translated, and codons were optimized to gain a high expression level in E. coli. The proposed vaccine construct may be a candidate for a multi-epitope vaccine. Experimental validation is required in future to test the safety and efficacy of the hypothetical candidate vaccine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this, weaning-age pigs are a key subpopulation. Recently, different alternatives to blood sampling have been introduced because they are easier, welfare-friendly and cost-saving tools. Moreover, most of them allow the testing of more animals and seem to be more sensitive in low-prevalence scenarios. However, these studies were implemented mainly in PRRSV-2-infected herds. The first objective of our study was to compare the rate of detection of PRRSV-1 by RT-qPCR in individual serum samples, family oral fluid samples (FOF) and udder wipes (UW) collected the day before weaning. The second objective was to evaluate the suitability of pooling. The study was performed on a 210-sow farrow-to-finish farm which was PRRSV-1 infected and unstable. A total of 119 litters were sampled. The rate of detection of PRRSV-1 in blood samples, FOF and UW was 10.9%, 7.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The agreement between sera and FOF was almost perfect even if the detection capacity of sera was numerically superior to FOF. The Ct values of positive sera were statistically lower than those of FOF. Two modalities of pooling (1:3 and 1:5) were tested for sera and FOF. For sera, both modalities did not impact the PRRSV-1 status either at the litter level or at the batch one. On the other hand, whatever the modality (pooled by 3 or 5), most of the pools of FOF gave negative results, misclassifying many litters and batches.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-seven 6-month-old goat kids (14.55 &#177; 2.7 kg body weight) were placed in individual pens during an experimental period of forty-two days. Each kid was placed under one of three distinct diets (n = 9 animals/diet) corresponding to the following experimental groups: Control (C, Hay + concentrate), Low Methionine (LM, Hay + concentrate + 3.5 g/Kg of Dry Matter (DM) of RP methionine, or High Methionine (HM, Hay + concentrate + 11.5 g/Kg of DM of RP methionine). After a 4-week period of adaptation to the diets, all the animals were experimentally infected with a single oral dose of 10,000 H. contortus third-stage infective larvae (L3). No significant effect of RP methionine supplementation was observed for feed intake, digestibility and growth performance. The faecal egg counts (FEC) and worm burdens were not impacted by RP methionine supplementation either. In contrast, Packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin concentration were higher in kids supplemented with RP methionine. Similarly, the level of serum IgA directed against adult H. contortus excretion and secretion products (ESP) was higher in supplemented kids. These results suggested that RP methionine supplementation improved goat kids' resilience against H. contortus infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, few studies reported the endoscopic instruments used for the retrieval attempt and the time spent for endoscopic removal. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the factors that can influence the success rate and timing of the endoscopic retrieval of FBs. The medical records of 92 animals undergoing endoscopic removal of esophageal (n = 12) and gastric (n = 84) FBs have been reviewed. Two dogs had FBs in both the esophagus and stomach. From medical records and video recordings, there were extrapolated data on signalment, clinical signs, endoscopic devices used, success of retrieval, and duration of endoscopy. Endoscopic removal of FBs was successful in 88% cases, and the mean time spent for the extraction was 59.74 min (range, 10-120 min). The success rate and timing for the removal of endoscopic foreign bodies (EFBs) are influenced by several factors in our population: medium-breed dogs, adult animals, and localization of FBs in the body of the stomach increased the probability of failure during the endoscopic retrieval attempt. Conversely, the success and timing of the retrieval of EFBs were higher in puppies and with increasing operator's experience. Moreover, the use of combination devices such as polypectomy snare and grasping forceps negatively influenced the success of extraction of FBs. Further prospective and comparative studies in a large and multicentric population of patients can be useful to create interventional endoscopic guidelines, as in human medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine fecal microbiome changes in 46 domestic cats with chronic digestive issues that received FMTs using lyophilized stool that was delivered in oral capsules. Fecal samples were collected from FMT recipients before and two weeks after the end of the full course of 50 capsules, as well as from their stool donors (N = 10), and other healthy cats (N = 113). The fecal microbiomes of FMT recipients varied with host clinical signs and dry kibble consumption, and shifts in the relative abundances of Clostridium, Collinsella, Megamonas, Desulfovibrio and Escherichia were observed after FMT. Overall, donors shared 13% of their bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with FMT recipients and the most commonly shared ASVs were classified as Prevotella 9, Peptoclostridium, Bacteroides, and Collinsella. Lastly, the fecal microbiomes of cats with diarrhea became more similar to the microbiomes of age-matched and diet-matched healthy cats compared to cats with constipation. Overall, our results suggest that microbiome responses to FMT may be modulated by the FMT recipient's initial presenting clinical signs, diet, and their donor's microbiome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood samples were drawn from 60 pregnant cows that had been vaccinated more than one year and less than two years previously. The samples were collected six weeks prior to the expected date of delivery. After sample collection, the cows were divided into two groups of 30. One group received 2 mL of BVDV vaccine, and a control group received 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Blood was collected from the cows three weeks post-administration. Additional blood samples were taken from calves at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after birth. The serum was separated from the collected blood, and BVDV antibody changes were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. BVDV antibody levels were higher from 8 to 20 weeks of age in calves born to late-gestational BVDV-vaccinated cows than in calves born to control cows (p &lt; 0.0083). Further analysis confirmed a slow decline in BVDV maternal antibodies in calves born to pregnant cows that produced high levels of BVDV antibodies following pre-calving BVDV vaccination. These results suggest that BVDV vaccination of cattle in late pregnancy may help to extend the duration of protection against BVDV infection in newborn calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Systematic microbiological testing of carcasses has not been mandatorily regulated in all abattoir premises, and the efficacy of the introduction of the Good Hygiene Practice and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) to some plants has not yet been tested microbiologically in Mongolia. Therefore, samples were collected from two establishments: plant A with an HACCP certificate from a third party and plant B without an HACCP certificate. The rates and levels of the total bacterial count (TBC) as overall hygiene indicators, the Enterobacteriaceae count (EBC) as fecal contamination indicators, and the Staphylococcus spp. count (SC) as personal hygiene indicators were determined on different parts of beef carcasses. The contamination rates in most parts were lower in plant A than in plant B (e.g., TBC in the rump and flank: 10[3]-10[5] and 10[5]-10[7], in plant A vs. 10[4]-10[6] and 10[5]-10[8] in plant B, respectively). Plant A also had a lower EBC and SC (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, 2 out of 100 beef carcasses (2%) were positive for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli as a foodborne pathogen indicator in plant A.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Effective and reliable detection of the virus is relevant to prevent uncontrolled contagion among boar populations and to reduce economic losses. Moreover, animal health laboratories are demanding standardisation, optimisation and quality assurance of the available diagnostic assays. In the present study, the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit was validated following the UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 guidelines. Analytical validation terms include in silico and in vitro specificity, sensitivity, efficiency and reliability (repeatability/reproducibility). Diagnostic validation of the method was assessed through the analysis of a total of 181 porcine samples originating from six different matrix types doped with African swine fever virus DNA received from the European reference laboratory for African Swine Fever (INIA-CISA, Madrid, Spain): whole blood, blood serum, kidney, heart, liver and tonsil. Results agreed with those obtained from a reference detection method also based on real-time PCR, endorsed by WOAH, but the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit incorporates some technical innovations and improvements which may benefit end-users. This kit, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, can recognise all known ASFV genotypes and brings additional benefits to the current qPCR technology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Companion animals share the lives and homes of many Americans, and yet little research exists on the intersection of disparities of access to veterinary care and access to human health care. This research aims to fill that gap by exploring the use of a spatial model that identifies the relationship of supply and demand while also considering reductions as a function of travel time to a care facility. Four counties in Alabama were analyzed at the census tract level to determine the supply of primary care physicians and veterinary care providers. This research provides a unique application of the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area model by independently examining access to each type of care and then comparing both access supply values at the census level. Results indicated a statistically significant positive relationship between access to both types of care, implying areas with lower access to primary care have concomitantly low access to veterinary care. Implications for practice include the introduction of this methodological approach, identification of future parameter specification research to improve the approach, and identification of an area of significant concern in the One Health framework. Further, the results can inform solution strategies such as offering integrated care interventions for both humans and their companion animal household members with direct use for policymakers aimed at increasing equitable access to health care across the One Health spectrum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fecal metabolomics revealed a significant reduction in metabolites associated with tryptophan metabolism in the DE-CA9[TM]-treated group. DE-CA9[TM] also significantly decreased phenylalanine and homocysteine and increased homoserine and threonine levels. Amino acid metabolism was also affected in the serum metabolome, with increased levels of urea and cadaverine, and reductions in N-acetylornithine in DE-CA9[TM] compared to controls. Similarly, changes in essential amino acids were observed, with a significant increase in tryptophan and lysine levels and a decrease in homocysteine. An increase in serum guanine and deoxyuridine was also detected, with a decrease in beta-alanine in the animals that ingested DE-CA9[TM].</Abstract><Abstract>Data generated throughout this study suggest that the daily administration of 1 &#215; 10[9] cfu of DE-CA9[TM] in healthy Beagle dogs is safe and does not affect markers of general health and fecal scores.

Study of the parasitic fauna of this species in this area is still limited. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of tapeworms from A. fallax lacustris sampled in Lake Garda. Sixty-six A. fallax lacustris specimens were collected at the Milan fish market (Lombardy, Italy); specifically, an evaluation of the gastrointestinal contents was carried out for the presence of helminths. All parasites found were fixed in 70% ethanol and transferred to the laboratories of the University of Messina for morphological and molecular analysis. Parts of the parasites were stained with Semichon's carmine red technique. Molecular analysis was carried out using LSU rRNA and ITS2 region genes. Eight specimens out of sixty-six (12.1%) were positive for adult cestodes within the pyloric caeca. Morphological and molecular analysis could to identify the parasites found to be Proteocephalus longicollis. This parasite species is not considered a zoonotic agent, representing a low risk of parasitic fish-borne zoonosis for consumers of this appreciated fish from Lake Garda.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To maximize the fertility of frozen-thawed buck spermatozoa, further research is required to overcome obstacles that have yielded controversial results and standardize protocols. In the present work, the effect of adding fumaric acid (a well-described antioxidant) to a soy lecithin semen extender on certain quality parameters of spermatozoa following freezing and thawing was examined for the first time. Five sexually mature Skopelos bucks were used, and ejaculates were collected with an artificial vagina. The semen samples (98 samples, five replicates) were diluted (400 &#215; 10[6] spermatozoa/mL) with OviXcell[&#174;], supplemented with fumaric acid (0 mM, 2.15 mM, 10 mM or 30 mM), equilibrated (5 &#176;C; 3 h), packed (0.5 mL straws), frozen and stored (-196 &#176;C) until further processing. After thawing, the spermatozoa total and progressive motility (CASA), viability (eosin-nigrosin), membrane functional integrity (HOST), acrosome integrity (SpermBlue[&#174;]) and mitochondrial function (Rhodamine-123/SYBR-14/PI) were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan's test; significance was set at 0.05. The addition of 2.15 mM fumaric acid improved (p &lt; 0.05) spermatozoa viability, membrane functional integrity, acrosome integrity and mitochondrial function compared to all other concentrations. The addition of 30 mM fumaric acid decreased (p &lt; 0.05) spermatozoa viability and mitochondrial function compared to all other concentrations. These results indicate a beneficial effect of a 2.15 mM fumaric acid addition to a soy lecithin extender on post-thaw buck spermatozoa quality. Further research is required to evaluate the in vivo fertility of frozen-thawed buck spermatozoa treated with fumaric acid, as well as to elucidate the mechanism of action of fumaric acid in spermatozoa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the current study was to assess the blood concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and electrocardiographic findings in SIRS-affected cats. Seventeen shorthair cats hospitalized with SIRS were enrolled (Group 1). SIRS diagnosis was performed based on the detection of at least two of the four criteria such as abnormal body temperature, abnormal heart rate (i.e., tachycardia or bradycardia), abnormal respiratory rate (i.e., tachypnea or bradypnea), and alterations of white blood cell number (i.e., leukocytes or band neutrophils). Ten cats screened for elective surgery such as neutering or dental procedures were evaluated as a control population (Group 2). They were considered healthy based on history, physical examination, hematological and biochemical profile, urinalysis, coprological exam, thyroxine assay, blood pressure measurement, and echocardiography. A physical examination, complete blood cell count, biochemistry test (including an electrolyte panel), electrocardiographic examination, and cTnI assay were carried out in each cat enrolled. Traumatic events, gastrointestinal, neoplastic, respiratory, and neurological disorders were identified as causes of SIRS in Group 1. In Group 1, a significantly higher concentration of cTnI than that in Group 2 was recorded (p = 0.004). In 37.5% of cats with SIRS, ventricular premature complexes occurring in couplets with multiform configuration were detected. Similarly, to humans, data herein reported would indicate possible cardiac damage present in cats with SIRS diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A simple diagnostic tool was developed to monitor DD prevalence at the herd level. An antibody ELISA based on antigens from four different Treponema spp. has been developed and validated in two field studies. In one study, bulk milk and individual milk samples of seven dairy herds, of which clinical claw scores were obtained, were tested. In the second study, bulk milk was tested from 110 herds of which clinical scores were obtained. A weak correlation between clinical scores of cows and the ELISA results in individual milk samples was observed. The ELISA response in bulk milk was higher in herds with higher mean clinical scores. Using the ELISA results in bulk milk, herds with a low or high proportion of cattle with DD lesions could be distinguished. This ELISA is useful to obtain insight into the DD status at the herd level, and is nowadays being used in a claw health monitoring program for dairy cattle in the Netherlands.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Results of the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test (NBT) showed significantly higher neutrophil activation in stage I (median:17.17, range: [7.33-31.50]%) compared to in healthy-seronegative (4.10 [1.20-18.00]%), healthy-seropositive (7.65 [3.98-21.74]%), stage II (6.50 [1.50-28.70]%), and stage III-IV (7.50 [3.00-16.75]%) groups (p &lt; 0.0001). Healthy-seropositive dogs also displayed higher values than all groups except stage I. Stages II and III-IV did not show significant differences compared to healthy-seronegative. Regarding IFN-&#947;, stage I dogs had higher concentrations (median:127.90, range: [0-3998.00] pg/mL) than healthy-seronegative (0 [0-109.50] pg/mL) (p = 0.0002), stage II (9.00 [0-5086.00] pg/mL) (p = 0.045), and stage III-IV (3.50 [80.00-548.80] pg/mL) (p = 0.02) dogs. Stage II dogs showed increased IFN-&#947; compared to healthy-seronegative dogs (p = 0.015), while stage III-IV dogs had no significant differences compared to healthy-seronegative dogs (p = 0.12). Healthy-seropositive dogs had elevated IFN-&#947; concentrations compared to healthy-seronegative dogs (p = 0.001) and dogs in stage III-IV (p = 0.03). In conclusion, neutrophil activation was higher in dogs with mild disease and healthy-seropositive dogs, and a relationship between neutrophil activation and the production of IFN-&#947; was found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total number of 120 female Italian buffaloes (60 normal and 60 with inflammatory reproductive diseases) were employed. Each buffalo's jugular vein was pierced to get five milliliters of blood. To obtain whole blood and extract DNA and RNA, the blood was placed within tubes containing sodium fluoride or EDTA anticoagulants. The immunological (IKBKG, LGALS, IL1B, CCL2, RANTES, MASP2, HMGB1, and S-LZ) genes' nucleotide sequence differences between healthy buffaloes and buffaloes affected by inflammatory reproductive diseases were found by employing PCR-DNA sequencing. According to Fisher's exact test (p &#706; 0.01), there were noticeably different probabilities of all major nucleotide changes spreading among buffalo groups with and without reproductive problems. Buffaloes were significantly more likely to express the examined genes when they had inflammatory reproductive diseases. The outcomes might support the significance of these markers' nucleotide variations and gene expression patterns as indicators of the prevalence of inflammatory reproductive disorders and provide a workable buffalo management policy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eighteen growing Assaf (5 months old) lambs were separated into three experimental groups (n = 6 lambs/group). The lambs were fed a basal diet without supplementation (G1) or supplemented with 2 and 4 g beeswax/head/day in G2 and G3 groups, respectively. Zootechnical performance was evaluated over a 90 day period. Feed digestibility was assessed in faeces through the acid insoluble-ash method, and rumen liquor was collected to measure ammonia (NH3-N) and total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) levels. Blood samples were obtained for the titration serum metabolites by colorimetric tests. The findings showed that G3 had an improved performance compared to the other groups (p &lt; 0.01). The lambs in G3 revealed the highest nutrient digestibility and feed use, followed by G2, and G1. G3 recorded the highest economic efficiency followed by G2 and G1 (p &lt; 0.01). The TVFA, acetate, and propionate concentrations were higher and the pH values, NH3-N, and butyrate concentrations were lower in G3 compared to G2 and particularly to G1 (p &lt; 0.01). The concentrations of total protein, globulin, and glucose were significantly higher with 4 g beeswax (p &lt; 0.05). However, albumin, cholesterol, total lipids, urea, creatinine, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) concentrations as well as the albumin to globulin ratio decreased significantly with both levels of beeswax (p &lt; 0.05). The addition of beeswax at the level of 4 g/head/day for growing Assaf lambs significantly improved the growth performance, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood serum parameters in addition to the economic efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37756097</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Method Validation and Establishment of Reference Intervals for an Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Chemiluminescent Immunoassay in Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>Previously, radioimmunoassay (RIA) has been the only assay to measure insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to diagnose hypersomatotropism (HS). Due to radiation concerns, availability, and the cost of IGF-1 RIA, validation of assays for automated analysers such as a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) is needed. The aim of this study was to validate a CLIA for measurement of feline IGF-1 (IMMULITE 2000[&#174;] XPi, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Malvern, PA, USA) compared to IGF1 RIA, establish reference interval (RI), and determine a cut-off value for diagnosis of HS in diabetic cats. Validation of assay performance included precision, linearity, and recovery studies. Right-sided RI was determined using surplus serum of 50 healthy adult cats. Surplus serum samples of diabetic cats with known IGF-1 concentration with (n = 32/68) and without HS (n = 36/68) were used for method comparison with RIA. The cut-off for diagnosis of HS was established using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was &#8804;4.7%, and the inter-assay CV was &#8804;5.6% for samples with low, medium, and high IGF-1 concentration. Linearity was excellent (R[2] &gt; 0.99). The correlation between CLIA and RIA was very high (rs = 0.97), with a mean negative bias for CLIA of 24.5%. The upper limit of RI was 670 ng/mL. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.94, with best cut-off for diagnosis of HS at 746 ng/mL (sensitivity, 84.4%; specificity, 97.2%). The performance of CLIA was good, and the RI and cut-off for HS diagnosis established in this study allow for CLIA to be used in routine work-up of diabetic cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this work was to determine the effects of a postbiotic obtained from inactivated and stabilized whole-cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, administered during the sow's gestation, on the performance of the mother and litter. Maternal feed intake, productive parameters, colostrum quality and post-weaning piglets' health were assessed, including antibiotic consumption. The trial involved 183 sows, divided into two groups: (1) sows fed with a daily supplementation of postbiotic during gestation (n = 90); (2) sows without any supplement (n = 93). Piglets were followed up at two different post-weaning sites. The lactation efficiency of the treated sows improved by +5.9% (41.3 &#177; 11.4 vs. 35.4 &#177; 11.6%; p = 0.011). Lactating piglets' mortality was lower in the treated group (25.1 &#177; 16.7 vs. 28.8 &#177; 14.4%; p = 0.048). The same tendency was shown in both the weaning sites, together with a reduced antibiotic consumption in weaning site 1 (0.72 &#177; 0.25 vs. 1.22 &#177; 0.30 DDDvet/PCU; p = 0.047). The results suggest the role of this postbiotic administered to the mother in improving the health status of the piglets. Furthermore, lactation efficiency is suggested as an interesting parameter for assessing the efficiency of farming.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cases of partial colonic agenesis have rarely been described. The purpose of this study was to report a cohort of dogs and cats diagnosed with partial colonic agenesis. The colon was measured during colonoscopy or contrast-radiography and compared to the average length described in the literature. Six dogs and 17 cats were retrospectively included. Depending on the case, partial colonic agenesis could represent an incidental finding or the likeliest cause of clinical signs. Diarrhea was reported in most cases, and no specific clinical or biological abnormality was observed. Median age of presentation was variable and long asymptomatic periods were common. Abdominal ultrasound was useful and identified a short colon in 14/17 cats but only in one dog. Endoscopy was useful to confirm the diagnosis and to identify associated lesions and complications. Among others, colonic stenosis was reported in 8/9 cases that had lifelong clinical signs and the shortest colon length. This anatomical abnormality could promote chronic inflammation that might generate fibrosis and ultimately stenosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Beta-adrenergic agonists and dietary protein have been critical factors in beef cattle production. Beta-agonists enhance growth, improve feed efficiency, and influence carcass composition, while dietary protein provides the necessary nutrients for muscle development and overall health. A balanced approach to their use and incorporation into cattle diets can lead to more efficient and sustainable beef production. However, microbiome technologies play an increasingly important role in beef cattle production, particularly by optimizing rumen fermentation, enhancing nutrient utilization, supporting gut health, and enhancing feed efficiency. Therefore, optimizing rumen fermentation, diet, and growth-promoting technologies has the potential to increase energy capture and improve performance. This review addresses the interactions among beta-adrenergic agonists, protein level and source, and the ruminal microbiome. By adopting innovative technologies, sustainable practices, and responsible management strategies, the beef industry can contribute to a more secure and sustainable food future. Continued research and development in this field can lead to innovative solutions that benefit both producers and the environment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Oocytes were collected from 20 control and 15 Hanwoo (Bos taurus coreanae) females treated with the FSH. A combination of decreasing FSH doses (36, 36, 24, and 24 mg, 12 h apart), progesterone, estrogen, and prostaglandins were administered to synchronize and mildly stimulate the animals. The FSH-treated group (1125 oocytes) and control group (1022 oocytes) exhibited a higher proportion of grade A and B oocytes (88.2%) than the other grades (p &lt; 0.05), with most at the germinal vesicle 2 stage (64.0%). Moreover, the FSH-treated group achieved a notably higher blastocyst rate (44.7%) compared to the control group (31.1%) (p &lt; 0.05). After undergoing vitrification and in vitro culture (IVC) warming, embryos in the FSH group exhibited higher re-expansion rates (grade 1: 86.9%; grades 2 and 3: 57.9%) compared to those in the control (p &lt; 0.05). This highlights the positive impact of FSH treatment on in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and the OPU rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, to the authors' knowledge, a detailed report on marmosets is not known at present. This case describes the clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a flea infestation by Ctenocephalides felis in a captive colony of common marmosets. Fleas, flea feces and skin lesions were identified on two animals during annual health screening. Subsequently, the entire colony was examined, and nearly half of the colony showed signs of infestation. Consequently, treatment was initiated for the entire colony and the environment. Animals received two topical administrations of imidacloprid (5 mg for animals &lt;200 g and 10 mg for animals weighing &gt;200 g) three weeks apart, and their enclosures were decontaminated using vaporizers containing permethrin, piperonyl butoxide, and pyriproxyfen. Subsequently, skin lesions were resolved and no evidence of fleas were noticed. No side effects of the treatment were observed. Stray cats were identified as the source of the infestation. Their access to the animal-related rooms was stopped. No reinfestation has been reported for 3 years. The topical application of imidacloprid appeared effective with no adverse events occurring, so may be appropriate for use in other non-human primates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One area of research has been the search for genetic risk variants in canine lymphoma, which is amongst the most common canine cancers. Previous studies have focused on a limited number of breeds, but none have included Border Collies. The aims of this study were to identify relationships between Border Collie lymphoma cases through an extensive pedigree investigation and to utilise relationship information to conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses to identify risk regions associated with lymphoma. The expanded pedigree analysis included 83,000 Border Collies, with 71 identified lymphoma cases. The analysis identified affected close relatives, and a common ancestor was identified for 54 cases. For the genomic study, a GWAS was designed to incorporate lymphoma cases, putative "carriers", and controls. A case-control GWAS was also conducted as a comparison. Both analyses showed significant SNPs in regions on chromosomes 18 and 27. Putative top candidate genes from these regions included DLA-79, WNT10B, LMBR1L, KMT2D, and CCNT1.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is limited literature examining the causes of SUD in cats and dogs, and no research specific to Australia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and pathology of SUD in cats and dogs in a multicentric study across Australia. Retrospective post-mortem reports of SUD in cats and dogs were obtained from four veterinary schools in Australia distributed across four states. The frequency of SUD between institutes ranged from 2.1% to 6.5%. Dogs composed the majority of the study population (76%), and males outnumbered females, particularly in the feline subpopulation. After necropsy, 37% of SUD remained cause unknown, the largest category in both cats and dogs. When cause was identified, cardiovascular disease was most common in both species, followed by gastrointestinal disease in dogs, and trauma in cats. In dogs, multinomial logistic regression identified age as a risk factor significantly associated with the four largest categories of SUD. This study identified causes of SUD in Australian cats and dogs, including novel causes not previously reported. Further, this study revealed a higher rate of unsolved SUD in Australia than can be found in the literature from other countries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A Case Study on the Field Lizard Podarcis siculus.</Title>	<Abstract>Soil contaminants (herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals) are among the main causes of change in terrestrial ecosystems. These substances lead to a general loss of biodiversity, both of flora and fauna and being able to biomagnify and pass through the food chain, they can endanger the survival of terrestrial vertebrates at the top of this chain. This review analyzes the risks associated with exposure to glyphosate, the active principle of many herbicide products, for the reproductive health of the field lizard (Podarcis siculus) potentially exposed to the substance in its natural habitat; therefore, introducing it as a possible model organism. Data demonstrate that glyphosate is toxic for this animal, affecting the health of the reproductive organs, both in males and females, and of the liver, the main detoxifying organ and closely involved in the female reproductive process. Sharing structural and functional characteristics of these organs with many other vertebrates, the information obtained with this reptile represents a wake-up call to consider when analyzing the cost/benefit ratio of glyphosate-based substances. The data clearly demonstrate that the P. siculus lizard can be considered a good target organism to study the reproductive risk assessment and hazards of exposure to soil contaminants on wild terrestrial vertebrates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An 11-year-old spayed female mixed-breed cat was brought to our hospital with facial nerve paralysis, which had been stable using prednisolone for 3 months. She was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma of the right middle ear after otoscopic sampling, which showed evidence of the filling of bilateral tympanic bullae on computed tomography. Hepatic involvement was suspected, and she was treated with multidrug chemotherapy, resulting in clinical remission. On day 176, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were performed at checkup, revealing tumor invasion into the nasopharyngeal region and the recurrence of hepatic lesions without any brain abnormality. Nasal congestion then worsened, and the patient died on day 228 after presenting with generalized seizures. Clinicians should be mindful of middle ear lymphoma as a differential diagnosis in cats who present with a sign of otitis media, especially whose condition does respond to corticosteroid treatment. The prognosis for feline middle ear lymphoma might not be as poor as previous reports, and multidrug chemotherapy might result in remission of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Portugal, data on this zoonosis are scarce despite being a mandatory notifiable disease in both humans and animals. To assess the impact of cystic echinococcosis on both livestock and humans, we compiled data from slaughterhouse records of ruminants, human hospitalizations, and confirmed cases of human echinococcosis. Overall, a total of 298 cases of cystic echinococcosis were identified in ruminants slaughtered from national farms for human consumption in Portugal between 2008 and 2022, comprising 192 cases in ovines, 95 in bovines, and 11 in caprines. Echinococcosis led to 582 hospitalizations in Portuguese public hospitals, with an average hospital stay of 11 days (&#177;15.66), and resulted in 13 deaths (2.23%) from 2008 to 2018. Each infected animal was associated with a 7% increase in the incidence rate of human hospitalization (p = 0.002, IRR = 1.070, 95% CI: 1.025-1.117). Additionally, for every 100,000 person-years observed between 2008 and 2018, the total number of hospitalizations was 0.528. Residence in the Alentejo region was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in the incidence rate of human hospitalizations and an 8-fold higher risk of death from echinococcosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eighteen 20-week-old Landrace breed fattening pigs (BW 76.61 &#177; 2.30 kg) were divided into three groups of six animals. The control group was fed a basal diet. The FS3 group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 10% flaxseed for 3 weeks. The FS6 group received the same basal diet with flaxseed for 6 weeks. The total antioxidant capacity of the blood, measured as the total antioxidant status (TAS), total plasma antioxidant capacity (FRAP), reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) and total antioxidant capacity (PAT), was not affected by the flaxseed diet. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly decreased in the FS3 pigs in the heart (p &lt; 0.05). However, in the FS3 group, the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased compared to the control, but in the FS6 group, the activity was inhibited (p &lt; 0.05). In the muscle, the CAT and GST activity was significantly decreased in the FS3 group (p &lt; 0.05). The thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) content was significantly reduced in the brain, muscle and heart in the FS3 group(p &lt; 0.05). In FS6, the TBARS content significantly increased in the heart and brain (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed that the health effect of a flaxseed diet is significantly conditioned by the length of the flaxseed addition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A wheat-soy-based basal feed that was formulated to be 0.42 MJ lower in metabolizable energy (ME) was mixed. The basal feed was then split into four batches, with the first batch set aside as the basal control; the second batch was supplemented with freshly milled BP; the third batch was supplemented with XYL; the fourth batch was supplemented with both BP and XYL, as in the previous two batches. Each diet was fed to eight pens, with two birds in a pen, following randomization. Feeding BP reduced bird growth and most of the digestibility coefficients but increased blood high-density lipoprotein (p &lt; 0.05). Dietary XYL increased bird growth, dietary ME and nutrient digestibility (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, XYL increased hepatic carotenoids and coenzyme Q10, but reduced blood low-density lipoprotein (p &lt; 0.05). There were no BP by XYL interactions (p &gt; 0.05) observed. Further research is needed to identify the optimum level of BP in broiler diets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The experimental diets were made by supplementing emodin at 0, 30, 100, and 150 mg kg[-1] to basal (control) diet, respectively, and fed to fish with an initial weight of 50.4 &#177; 2.35 g. All fish were divided into five experimental groups: uninfected fish fed with basal control diet (negative control, NC), infected fish fed with the diet supplemented with 0 (positive control group, PC), 30 (30), 100 (100), and 150 mg/kg (150) of emodin. The fish were reared for 14 days and sampled at different time points. The results showed that the total bacterial count in the kidney, blood, and liver tissues of Wuchang bream infected with A. hydrophila was significantly affected by the supplementation and feeding time of emodin. At the beginning of the experiment, the difference in total bacterial count among the groups was not significant. On day 1, the total bacterial count in all groups was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in the negative control group. On day 4, the total bacterial count in all the emodin groups was significantly reduced, and the best bactericidal effect was observed in the 100 mg kg[-1] group. In addition, emodin had a significant effect on the immune response of Wuchang bream after infection with A. hydrophila (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the other groups, the respiratory burst activity, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-1 (IL-1) content, and white blood cell count (WBC) in the 100 and 150 mg kg[-1] groups could be restored to normal levels in the shortest time (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, this study also measured the complement alternative pathway activity (ACH50), plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the fish. The results showed that supplying 100 mg kg[-1] emodin to the diet could significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increase the ACH50 activity of the fish. Compared with the positive control (PC) group, the addition of emodin to the diet can inhibit the decrease in SOD activity and the increase in MDA content in the plasma of infected Wuchang bream. In conclusion, supplying 100 mg kg[-1] emodin to the diet can enhance the ability of Wuchang bream to resist A. hydrophila infection by reducing the total bacterial count in tissues, increasing the activity of related immune enzymes, and promoting the secretion of cytokines. This provides a theoretical basis for production practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In addition to changes in production systems that include new concerns for animal welfare, global climate change in recent years has become a major challenge in the spread of ectoparasites around the world. This review includes information regarding the main form of controlling poultry mites through the use of commercially available chemicals. In addition, non-chemical measures against blood-sucking mites were discussed such as extracts and oils from plants and seeds, entomopathogenic fungi, semiochemicals, powder such as diatomaceous earth and silica-based products, and vaccine candidates. The control of poultry mites using chemical methods that are currently used to control or eliminate them are proving to be less effective as mites develop resistance. In contrast, the products based on plant oils and extracts, powders of plant origin, fungi, and new antigens aimed at developing transmission-blocking vaccines against poultry mites provide some encouraging options for the rational control of these ectoparasites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Research on the prevalence of leptospirosis in horses in the central-west region of Brazil has been relatively scarce. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in equine herds in the state of Goi&#225;s (Central Brazil). Blood samples were collected from 894 equids at 294 randomly selected farms divided into three different strata according to their herd characteristics. The microscopic agglutination test for the detection of anti-Leptospira agglutinins was carried out and the results showed that among the 294 sampled farms, 213 (72.9%; CI 95% 71.7-78.9) had one or more animals positive for leptospirosis, and of the 894 horses sampled, 513 (61.6%; CI 95% 54.3-69.0) were seropositive for leptospirosis. Djasiman, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Australis were the most prevalent serogroups. The results showed a high prevalence of seropositive animals and a widespread distribution of positive farms in the state of Goi&#225;s. Thus, environmental sanitation measures and health education to prevent and control equine leptospirosis in the state are required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its causative agent is referred to as Trypanosoma equiperdum and the prescribed serodiagnosis method is the complement fixation test (CFT). In the context of our European Reference Laboratory mandate for equine diseases (excluding African horse sickness), we organised dourine CFT inter-laboratory proficiency tests (ILPTs) in 2015, 2018 and 2022 to evaluate the performance of the European Union network of National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for dourine. ILPT panels were composed of horse sera with or without antibodies against Trypanosoma spp. originating from non-infected, immunised or experimentally infected horses. Twenty-two NRLs participated in at least one of the three sessions. In 2015, 2018 and 2022, the percentage of laboratories obtaining 100% of the expected results was 57, 90 and 80, respectively. These dourine CFT ILPTs showed the benefits of standardising the method's detection limit and underlined the constant need to evaluate NRLs to improve the network's performance. These results also argue in favour of the need for a representative bio-bank to improve the representativeness of ILPT samples and to allow the adoption of alternative serological methods for international surveillance of dourine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They differ from liposarcomas yet also exhibit neoplastic cell infiltration and often recur despite surgical removal. A 10-year-old spayed Maltese female dog presented with hindlimb paresis and back pain for two months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extensive fatty mass impinging on the vertebral canal, compressing the spinal cord, and extending into the surrounding muscle layers and thoracic cavity. The mass was surgically removed, and subsequent postoperative computed tomography confirmed complete removal of the mass using Vitrea[&#174;] advanced visualization fat measurement. Histopathological analysis confirmed that the mass was an infiltrative lipoma. The patient's symptoms completely resolved after surgery, with no recurrence reported at the 2-year follow-up. This case highlights the benefits of using postoperative computed tomography combined with the automated fat measurement technique to determine whether reoperation is necessary or to predict patient prognosis by identifying potential residual lipoma post-surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Barley grains contain anti-nutritional factors that limit their dietary inclusion in the poultry industry. The treatment of barley with solid-state fermentation and exogenous enzymes (FBEs) provides a good alternative to common cereals. In this study, barley grains were subjected to solid-state microbial fermentation using Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis and exogenous fibrolytic enzymes. This study aimed to assess the impact of FBEs on growth, feed utilization efficiency, immune modulation, antioxidant status and the expression of intestinal barrier and nutrient transporter-related genes. One-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308, n = 400) comprised four representative groups with ten replicates (10 chicks/replicate) and were fed corn-soybean meal basal diets with inclusions of FBEs at 0, 5, 10 and 15% for 38 days. Solid-state fermentation of barley grains with fibrolytic enzymes increased protein content, lowered crude fiber and reduced sugars compared to non-fermented barley gains. In consequence, the group fed FBEs10% had the superior feed utilization efficiency and body weight gain (increased by 4.7%) with higher levels of nutrient metabolizability, pancreatic digestive enzyme activities and low digesta viscosity. Notably, the group fed FBEs10% showed an increased villi height and a decreased crypt depth with a remarkable hyperactivity of duodenal glands. In addition, higher inclusion levels of FBEs boosted serum immune-related parameters and intestinal and breast muscle antioxidants status. Intestinal nutrient transporters encoding genes (GLUT-1, CAAT-1, LAT1 and PepT-1) and intestinal barriers encoding genes (MUC-2, JAM-2, occludin, claudins-1 and &#946;-defensin 1) were upregulated with higher dietary FBEs levels. In conclusion, feeding on FBEs10% positively enhanced broiler chickens' performance, feed efficiency and antioxidant status, and boosted intestinal barrier nutrient transporters encoding genes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recently, beyond the endemic viruses PRRSV and PCV2, emerging viruses such as TTSuV, PCV3, and PPV2, have been associated with PRDC, but their role remains unclear. This study investigates the presence of PCV2 and PRRSV and emerging viruses (PCV3, TTSuV, and PPV2) in the lungs of swine belonging to different age groups by histopathology and real-time PCR. The prevalent lung lesion was interstitial pneumonia with increased severity in post-weaning pigs. PRRSV was detected in 33% of piglets' lungs and in 20% of adults and post-weaning pigs with high Ct, while PCV2 was found in 100% of adult pigs, 33% of post-weaning pigs, and 22% of piglets, with low Ct in post-weaning pigs. PCV3 was present in all categories and coexisted with other viruses. TTSuV was detected in all swine in combination with other viruses, possibly influencing the disease dynamics, while PPV2 was detected in 100% of adults' and 90% of piglets' lungs. The detection of TTSuV, PCV3, and PPV2 in affected pigs prioritizes the need for comprehensive approaches in implementing appropriate control measures and minimizing economic losses associated with PRDC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are the central hub for immune responses during host-virus infection and have been recognized as crucial targets for BVDV infection. In order to elucidate the dynamics of host-BVDV-1 interaction, this study harnessed RNA-seq and iTRAQ methods to acquire an extensive dataset of transcriptomics and proteomics data from samples of BVDV-1-infected PBMCs at the 12-h post-infection mark. When compared to mock-infected PBMCs, we identified 344 differentially expressed genes (DEGs: a total of 234 genes with downregulated expression and 110 genes with upregulated expression) and 446 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs: a total of 224 proteins with downregulated expression and 222 proteins with upregulated expression). Selected DEGs and DEPs were validated through quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and parallel reaction monitoring. Gene ontology annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis underscored the significant enrichment of DEGs and DEPs in various immunity-related signaling pathways, including antigen processing and presentation, complement and coagulation cascades, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, among others. Further analysis unveiled that those DEGs and DEPs with downregulated expression were predominantly associated with pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades, the interleukin-17 signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Conversely, upregulated DEGs and DEPs were chiefly linked to metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, complement and coagulation cascades, and the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. These altered genes and proteins shed light on the intense host-virus conflict within the immune realm. Our transcriptomics and proteomics data constitute a significant foundation for delving further into the interaction mechanism between BVDV and its host.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study is to identify PRNP polymorphism in Awassi sheep from T&#252;rkiye, the Palestinian Authority, and Saudi Arabia. A total of 150 healthy sheep were genotyped for PRNP, using Sanger sequencing. There were seven alleles and eleven genotypes observed based on codons 136, 154, and 171 of PRNP. The ARQ allele was predominant in all populations. The most resistant allele to scrapie, ARR, was present in all three regions. The VRQ allele, associated with the highest susceptibility to scrapie, was detected only in T&#252;rkiye at a low frequency. In this study, twenty-seven amino acid substitutions were found. Eight of them (R40Q, G65E, H88L, S98T, A118P, S138T, V192F and L250I) have not been previously reported. These data indicate that sheep breeds close to the sheep domestication center have maintained high genetic diversity in the PRNP region. Our findings on PRNP will provide valuable insights for sheep breeding programs, aiding in the selection of genotypes resistant to scrapie in T&#252;rkiye, the Palestinian Authority, and Saudi Arabia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study examines 435 horses from Kazakhstan, covering seven groups in three geographic areas using 11 STR markers. Identified are 136 alleles, with the mean number of alleles per locus ranging from 9 to 19. VHL20 is the most variable locus across groups, while loci HTG4, AHT4, AHT5, HTG7, and HMS3 are variable in most populations. The locus AHT5 in the Emba population shows the highest frequency of rare alleles, while the lowest frequency, 0.005, is observed in the Kulandy population. All loci were highly informative for the Kazakhstani populations of E. caballus, with PIC values higher than 0.5. Pairwise variations in Wright's FST distances show that the examined varieties have little genetic differentiation (0.05%), indicating a high degree of admixture and a continuing lineage sorting process. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses reveal three major clusters of Kazakh horses, representing (I) the Uralsk population of the Kushum breed and the monophyly of two groups: (II) the Kozhamberdy population of the Mugalzhar breed, and (III) the Mugalzhar-Kushum breed populations. Kazakhstani horse populations, while being regionally isolated, were recently in contact with each other.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pigs play an important role in the overall epidemiology of influenza because of their ability to transmit influenza viruses of avian and human origin, which plays a potential role in the emergence of zoonotic strains with pandemic potential. The aim of our study was to assess the seroprevalence of Swine Influenza Viruses (swIAVs) in commercial pig farms in Greece. A total of 1416 blood samples were collected from breeding animals (gilts and sows) and pigs aged 3 weeks to market age from 40 different swIAV vaccinated and unvaccinated commercial farrow-to-finish pig farms. For the detection of anti-SIV antibodies, sera were analyzed using an indirect ELISA kit CIVTEST SUIS INFLUENZA[&#174;], Hipra (Amer, Spain). Of the total 1416 animals tested, 498 were seropositive, indicating that the virus circulates in both vaccinated (54% seroprevalence) and unvaccinated Greek pig farms (23% seroprevalence). In addition, maternally derived antibody (MDA) levels were lower in pigs at 4 and 7 weeks of age in unvaccinated farms than in vaccinated farms. In conclusion, our results underscore the importance of vaccination as an effective tool for the prevention of swIAV infections in commercial farrow-to-finish pig farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Immunocastration could be a solution to avoid undesirable pregnancies and boar taint in cull sows. The present study tested three immunocastration protocols (with Improvac[&#174;]) according to their reproductive cycle. The first inoculation was performed two weeks after farrowing (IM1, n = 5), at the beginning of estrus (IM2, n = 5), and one week after the end of estrus (IM3, n = 5), followed by a second administration four weeks apart. A control group (C, n = 5) was also included in the same housing conditions. The sample collection included the reproductive tract for morphometric evaluation, neck fat for the quantification of boar taint compounds, and a portion of the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum for meat quality trait assessment. The reproductive tracts from intact sows (C) were significantly heavier compared to the immunocastrated groups (p &lt; 0.05) (1.403 kg C to 0.508 kg IM1, 0.590 kg IM2, and 0.599 kg IM3), suggesting the regression of the reproductive tract to nonstimulated conditions due to immunization against GnRH. The IM1 group exhibited significantly smaller reproductive tract measurements compared to group C for most of the evaluated segments (p &lt; 0.05). No marked differences were observed in the meat quality traits. Therefore, immunocastration can be used in culling sows to avoid ovarian activity, and it is not detrimental to pork quality traits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The detection of pathogens associated with respiratory disease is a pivotal part of the diagnostic workup for respiratory disease. We aimed to report how frequently certain viruses and bacteria were detected in samples from pigs with respiratory symptoms in the course of routine diagnostic procedures. Altogether, 1975 routine diagnostic samples from pigs in Austrian swine stocks between 2016 and 2021 were analysed. PCR was performed to detect various pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (n = 921), influenza A virus (n = 479), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (n = 518), Mycoplasma (M.) hyopneumoniae (n = 713), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (n = 198), Glaesserella (G.) parasuis (n = 165) and M. hyorhinis (n = 180). M. hyorhinis (55.1%) had the highest detection rate, followed by PCV2 (38.0%) and Streptococcus (S.) suis (30.6%). PRRSV was detected most frequently in a pool of lung, tonsil and tracheobronchial lymph node (36.2%). G. parasuis was isolated more frequently from samples taken after euthanasia compared to field samples. PRRSV-positive samples were more likely to be positive for PCV2 (p = 0.001), M. hyopneumoniae (p = 0.032) and Pasteurella multocida (p &lt; 0.001). M. hyopneumoniae-positive samples were more likely to be positive for P. multocida (p &lt; 0.001) and S. suis (p = 0.046), but less likely for M. hyorhinis (p = 0.004). In conclusion, our data provide evidence that lung samples that were positive for a primary pathogenic agent were more likely to be positive for a secondary pathogenic agent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We aimed to compare tracheal length and diameter between normo- and brachycephalic cats using computed tomography (CT) image measurements and evaluate their usefulness in tracheostomy planning. A total of 15 normocephalic and 14 brachycephalic cats were included in the study. Tracheas of normocephalic cats were significantly longer compared with brachycephalic cats. No difference was detected in tracheal diameter between normocephalic and brachycephalic cats. Both groups had a lateral diameter significantly larger than the dorsoventral diameter at the level of the cranial end of the manubrium sterni and at the level of the second rib. Normocephalic and brachycephalic cats' tracheas have the same dorsoventral flattening at the level of the cranial end of the manubrium sterni and at the level of the second rib. The location between the 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae seems the best place to perform a tracheostomy in cats due to its round shape and easily accessible anatomical location. No sign of tracheal hypoplasia in brachycephalic cats was detected. Finally, 7 mm appears to be an adequate diameter for the tracheal tubes used to perform feline tracheostomies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The juvenile forms, which are found in the small intestine, are more pathogenic compared to the adults. Severe diarrhoea and weight loss are the major clinical signs, and the disease might be fatal in severely infested individuals. In the last decade, paramphistomosis has been described as an emerging parasitic disease in Europe. This study aimed to identify the rumen fluke species in wild ruminants from western Romania. Fifty-two pre-stomachs obtained from roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) that were hunted on 14 hunting grounds from Timi&#537; and Arad counties were examined for the presence of paramphistomes. Three (9.09%) out of 33 samples were positive in Timi&#537; County, and one (5.26%) out of 19 samples was positive in Arad County. Subsequent PCR testing revealed that three samples were positive for Calicophoron daubneyi and one for Paramphistomum leydeni. The presence of C. daubneyi and P. leydeni in roe deer has not been previously reported in Romania. Two Paramphistomum species-C. daubneyi and P. leydeni-were revealed as the main species of rumen flukes in roe deer from forests in Romania.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37888556</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Nutritional Strategies to Promote Bovine Oocyte Quality for In Vitro Embryo Production: Do They Really Work?</Title>	<Abstract>The ability of bovine oocytes to reach the blastocyst stage (i.e., embryo with around 150 cells in cattle) in vitro can be affected by technical (e.g., culture medium used) and physiological factors in oocyte donors (e.g., age, breed). As such, the nutritional status of oocyte donors plays a significant role in the efficiency of in vitro embryo production (IVEP), and several nutritional strategies have been investigated in cattle subjected to ovum pick-up (OPU). However, there is no clear consensus on the reliability of nutritional schemes to improve IVEP in cattle. Available evidence suggests that a moderate body condition score (i.e., 3 in a 1-5 scale) in cattle is compatible with a metabolic microenvironment in ovarian follicles that will promote embryo formation in vitro. The usefulness of fatty acid and micronutrient supplementation to improve IVEP in cattle is debatable with the current information available. Overall, the supply of maintenance nutritional requirements according to developmental and productive stage seems to be enough to provide bovine oocyte donors with a good chance of producing embryos in vitro. Future nutrition research in cattle using OPU-IVEP models needs to consider animal well-being aspects (i.e., stress caused by handling and sampling), which could affect the results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Updated knowledge regarding the global epidemiology of tick-borne Rickettsia hoogstraalii is dispersed, and its molecular detection and genetic characterization are missing in Pakistan. The current study objectives were to molecularly detect and genetically characterize Rickettsia species, especially R. hoogstraalii, in hard ticks infesting livestock in Pakistan, and to provide updated knowledge regarding their global epidemiology. Ticks were collected from livestock, including goats, sheep, and cattle, in six districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Pakistan. Overall, 183 hosts were examined, of which 134 (73.2%), including goats (number = 39/54, 72.2%), sheep (23/40, 57.5%), and cattle (71/89, 80%) were infested by 823 ticks. The most prevalent tick species was Rhipicephalus microplus (number = 283, 34.3%), followed by Hyalomma anatolicum (223, 27.0%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (122, 14.8%), Haemaphysalis sulcata (104, 12.6%), Haemaphysalis montgomeryi (66, 8.0%), and Haemaphysalis bispinosa (25, 3.03%). A subset of 210 ticks was selected and screened for Rickettsia spp. using PCR-based amplification and subsequent sequencing of rickettsial gltA and ompB fragments. The overall occurrence rate of R. hoogstraalii was 4.3% (number = 9/210). The DNA of Rickettsia was detected in Hy. anatolicum (3/35, 8.5%) and Ha. sulcata (6/49, 12.2%). However, no rickettsial DNA was detected in Rh. microplus (35), Rh. turanicus (35), Ha. montgomeryi (42), and Ha. bispinosa (14). The gltA and ompB fragments showed 99-100% identity with R. hoogstraalii and clustered phylogenetically with the corresponding species from Pakistan, Italy, Georgia, and China. R. hoogstraalii was genetically characterized for the first time in Pakistan and Hy. anatolicum globally. Further studies should be encouraged to determine the role of ticks in the maintenance and transmission of R. hoogstraalii in different hosts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An online survey composed of both closed and open-ended questions was administered from January to March 2019. A total of 2358 respondents answered the questions on pet care practices. Of these, 37.5 percent (n = 885) were both dog and cat owners, 28.0 percent (n = 652) were cat owners, and 26.0 percent (n = 609) were dog owners, while 9% (n = 212) of respondents did not own a cat or dog at the time of taking the survey. The study revealed that most respondents (&gt;90%) acknowledge the importance of providing adequate housing, regular worming and flea treatments, microchipping, and vaccinations for their pets. Notably, demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, age range, having children, having a rural upbringing, and place of residence influenced owners' attitudes, with those towards cat care practices varying more than those for dogs. The study highlights the need for responsible pet ownership interventions considering these demographic factors. The study identifies a knowledge gap among pet owners concerning the importance of regular veterinary visits and the impact of breeding for certain looks on animal welfare. The use of shock collar devices provoked varying opinions on their usage for training and behavior modification. The study suggests that enhancing pet owners' knowledge is pivotal for responsible pet ownership. Overall, the findings emphasize the need for tailored interventions that account for demographic variations for promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare. The findings underscore the importance of improving access to veterinary health care teams, especially in rural areas, and of providing culturally appropriate education resources for both pet owners and veterinary health care teams.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between epidemiological and clinical risk factors with the histopathological diagnosis of malignant mammary tumors in dogs treated at the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Uberl&#226;ndia, which has one of the first veterinary oncology services in Brazil. A retrospective matched case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for the development of malignant mammary tumors in dogs. The variables analyzed were size dog, breed, housing, type of diet, and body score. Potential risk factors were selected by univariate analysis (p &lt; 0.25) before multivariate forward binary logistic regression. The most frequent benign tumor was the benign mixed tumor (35.2%), and the most frequent malignant tumor was the mixed carcinoma (27.4%). Size dog, breed, housing, and overweight are predictors of malignant mammary tumors in dogs. The highest risk of developing malignant mammary tumors is associated with large female dogs, Yorkshire or Poodle breeds, living outside the home, or being overweight.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is critical for disease control, with several methods currently available. Among the serological tests, the DPP rapid test and the EIE-LVC, more commonly used in Brazil, are associated with variable sensitivity and specificity. Research with novel recombinant proteins such as the ELISA with the recombinant chimeric protein Q5 may therefore improve the CVL diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the true diagnostic potential of Q5 in an ELISA assay using a large number of CVL-suspected sera (406) with a previous positive diagnosis based on the rapid DPP test. Sera from the DPP-positive dogs, also assessed with the EIE-LVC test, were compared with sera from healthy dogs (n = 46) and used for ELISA tests using the recombinant Q5. The resulting data as well as the correlation with the clinical signs and the environmental characteristics of the animals were analyzed using Medal and GraphPad Prism 8.0. Overall, similar levels of lower sensitivity (67-68%) were seen for both the commercial EIE-LVC test and the Q5 ELISA when all assessed sera were considered, but a much greater sensitivity (92%) was seen for those samples from symptomatic dogs only. In contrast, many negative results were observed for the DPP-positive sera from asymptomatic dogs or those with no clinical information available. A selection of those sera were tested yet again in new ELISA assays using a second batch of the recombinant Q5, purified under milder denaturing conditions, as well as using another recombinant protein (Lci13). The results reveal a higher-than-expected incidence of likely false-positive results for DPP, reinforcing the need for other recombinant proteins, such as the chimeric Q5, to be investigated as possible alternatives to the currently used CVL diagnostic methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the animal sector is constantly neglected, even though accurate detection by molecular tools could represent economic advantages by preventing the spread of viruses. In this regard, the swine industry is of great interest. The main viruses that affect the swine industry are described in this review, including African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine circovirus (PCV), which have been effectively detected by different molecular tools in recent times. Here, we describe the rationale of molecular techniques such as multiplex PCR, isothermal methods (LAMP, NASBA, RPA, and PSR) and novel methods such as CRISPR-Cas and microfluidics platforms. Successful molecular diagnostic developments are presented by highlighting their most important findings. Finally, we describe the barriers that hinder the large-scale development of affordable, accessible, rapid, and easy-to-use molecular diagnostic tests. The evolution of diagnostic techniques is critical to prevent the spread of viruses and the development of viral reservoirs in the swine industry that impact the possible development of future pandemics and the world economy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We used 20 bulls aged between 19.8 and 22.7 months, divided into two groups according to the results of the Breeding Soundness Evaluation (BSE): approved (FIT n = 10) and not approved (UNFIT n = 10). The scrotal perimeter was measured and a semen collection was performed through electroejaculation. The percentage of sperm motility, mass motility, and sperm vigor were calculated using conventional microscopy, and the percentage of sperm abnormalities was calculated using phase-contrast microscopy of all ejaculates. Seminal plasma was separated from spermatozoa using centrifugation and processed for proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS. Seminal plasma proteins were identified using MASCOT Daemon software v.2.4.0 and label-free quantification analysis was carried out by SCAFFOLD Q+ software v.4.0 using the Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) method. Functional classification of proteins was performed based on their genetic ontology terms using KOG. Functional cluster analysis was performed on DAVID. There were no differences in scrotal perimeter and physical semen characteristics between FIT and UNFIT groups of bulls. The percentage of sperm abnormalities was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the UNFIT group of bulls. A total of 297 proteins were identified for the two groups. There were a total of 11 differentially abundant proteins (p &lt; 0.05), two of them more abundant in FIT bulls (Spermadhesin-1 and Ig gamma-1 chain C region) and nine in UNFIT bulls (Vasoactive intestinal peptide, Metalloproteinase inhibitor 2, Ig lambda-1 chain C regions, Protein FAM3C, Hemoglobin beta, Seminal ribonuclease, Spermadhesin 2, Seminal plasma protein BSP-30kDa, and Spermadhesin Z13). Spermadhesin-1 was the protein with the highest relative abundance (36.7%) in the seminal plasma among all bulls, corresponding to 47.7% for the FIT bulls and 25,7% for the UNFIT bulls. Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones were the functional categories with the highest number of classified proteins. Protein functional annotation clusters were related to Phospholipid efflux, ATP binding, and chaperonin-containing T-complex. The differentially abundant proteins in the group of FIT bulls were related to sperm capacitation and protection against reactive species of oxygen. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins in the group of UNFIT bulls were related to motility inhibition, intramembrane cholesterol removal and oxidative stress. In conclusion, the proteomic profile of the seminal plasma of FIT bulls presents proteins with participation in several biological processes favorable to fertilization, while the proteins of the seminal plasma of UNFIT bulls indicate a series of alterations that can compromise the fertilizing capacity of the spermatozoa. In addition, the relative abundance of spermadhesin-1 found in the seminal plasma of young Nellore bulls could be studied as a reproductive parameter for selection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lens extraction has been previously described in fish, but the long-term outcome of this procedure has not been evaluated. Eleven captive-bred adult fish housed in a public aquarium presented with unilateral (n = 3/11) or bilateral (n = 8/11) mature cataracts. All cases belonged to three endangered fish populations: striped bass (Morone saxatilis) originating from the Saint Lawrence River and Atlantic and spotted wolffish (Anarhichas lupus and Anarhichas minor). Pre-operatively, fish presented with anorexia, dark discoloration, abnormal position in the water column, skin abrasions, and/or decreased body condition scores. A lensectomy was performed in eleven fish, including a bilateral procedure in four fish, corresponding to fifteen eyes. Follow-up examinations were performed one to two weeks and one year post surgery. The main complication was self-resolving: corneal edema was present in 67% of eyes, persistent after a week in 47% of eyes, and resolved thereafter. Post-operatively, 73% of fish resumed feeding and regained a good body condition score. Persistent visual impairment post-surgery associated with anorexia required euthanasia in three out of eleven cases. The median time of death was 336 days post surgery (range: 27-1439 days) and three cases were still alive 1334 to 1425 days after the lensectomy. This was considered a favorable outcome for these older individuals with concurrent diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The current study investigated the impact of the bioactive lipid compounds of oregano and peppermint and their combination on the sustainability of meat production and the health of broiler chicks in hot climatic conditions. Two hundred and fifty-six one-day-old broiler chicks were distributed into four treatment groups. The birds were fed a control diet, bioactive lipid compounds of oregano (BLCO, 150 mg/kg), bioactive lipid compounds of peppermint (BLCP, 150 mg/kg), or a combination of BLCO and BLCP at 150 mg/kg each for 35 days. Each treatment included 8 replicates, each with 8 birds. The results showed that adding BLCO and BLCP separately or in combination to broiler diets improved body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio. BLCO, BLCP, or their combination increased the percentages of the dressing and gizzard and lowered the percentage of abdominal fat as compared to the control. Supplementation of BLCO, BLCP, or their combination decreased serum cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, creatinine, and urea compared to control. BLCO, BLCP, or their combination reduced cook and drip loss in the meat of broilers. In conclusion, birds fed diets containing BLCO and BLCP, either independently or in combination, showed improvements in performance, blood biochemistry, and meat quality in hot climatic conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of AIT in horses with allergic diseases in a systematic manner. Three databases were searched to identify articles reporting clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with AIT. The articles were evaluated for beneficial responses to AIT, defined as a &#8805;50% reduction in clinical signs, and clinical remission. Horses with respiratory diseases, urticaria, and pruritic dermatitis receiving insect monotherapy or multi-allergen AIT were included. All adverse events were graded, and analytical and confounding biases were assessed. The results showed that multi-allergen AIT had a beneficial response in 75% of horses with respiratory diseases, 88% with urticaria, and 56% with pruritic dermatitis. However, horses treated solely with insect AIT for pruritic dermatitis had a lower response rate (36%). Self-limiting local reactions were the most common adverse events, with systemic reactions grade II accounting for 11% of reported events. Analytical and confounding biases were identified as major limitations in the available studies. Further research is needed to address these biases and provide stronger evidence on the efficacy and safety of AIT in horses with allergic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37888566</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Establishment of the Maximum Residual Limit in the Milk of Dairy Cows Injected Intramuscularly with Prednisolone.</Title>	<Abstract>We measured the levels of prednisolone (PSL) residues in milk of intramuscularly dosed dairy cows and established a withdrawal time (WT) of PSL in milk. Eight healthy Holstein cows were injected with 10 (PSL-1) or 20 (PSL-2) mL of 10 mg/mL of PSL, and then, their milk was sampled at 12 h intervals for five days. PSL residue concentrations in milk were determined using LC-MS/MS. The correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was 0.9976. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.2 &#181;g/kg and 0.6 &#956;g/kg, respectively. Recoveries ranged from 96.5% to 110.0%, and the coefficient of variation was &lt;5.64%. At 24 h after administration, PSL levels in PSL-1 and PSL-2 were below the LOQ in all milk samples. Although this study had a smaller sample size than the European Medicines Agency's recommendations (n = 20), it was based on the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency guidelines of the Republic of Korea (n = 8) for the determination of withdrawal periods in milk. We established the withdrawal period for both PSL-1 and PSL-2 in milk at 12 h. In conclusion, we developed an analytical method that is sensitive and can reliably detect PSL in milk, and our estimated WT of PSL in bovine milk is shorter than the current 3-day withdrawal period of PSL in commercial PSL products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In the acute toxicity trial, the mice were administered orally at a dose rate of 30.0 g GYS/kg body weight (BW) three times a day. The general behavior, side effects, and death rate were noticed for 14 days following treatment. In the subacute toxicity trial, the rats were administered orally at a dose rates of30.0, 15.0, and 7.5 g GYS/kg BW once a day for 28 days. The rats were monitored every day for clinical signs and deaths; changes in body weight and relative organ weights (ROW) were recorded every week, hematological, biochemical, and pathological parameters were also examined at the end of treatment. The results showed that the level of stachydrine hydrochloride in GYS was 2.272 mg/g. In the acute toxicity trial, the maximum-tolerated dose of GYS was more than 90.0 g/kg BW, and no adverse effects or mortalities were noticed during the 14 days in the mice. At the given dose, there were no death or toxicity signs all through the 28-day subacute toxicity trial.The oral administration of GYS at a dose rate of 30.0 g/kg/day BW had no substantial effects on BW, ROW, blood hematology, gross pathology, histopathology, and biochemistry (except glucose), so 30.0 g/kg BW/day was determined as the no-observed-adverse-effect dosage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37888568</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Characterisation of Milk Microbiota from Subclinical Mastitis and Apparently Healthy Dairy Cattle in Free State Province, South Africa.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine mastitis is an inflammation of the udder tissue of the mammary gland brought on by microbial infections or physical damage. It is characterised by physical, chemical, and biological changes in the udder and milk. While several different bacterial species have been identified as causative agents of mastitis, many subclinical mastitis (SCM) cases remain culture-negative. The aim of this study was to characterise milk microbiota from SCM and apparently healthy dairy cows (non-SCM) by 16S rRNA sequencing. Alpha-diversity metrics showed significant differences between SCM cows and non-SCM counterparts. The beta-diversity metrics in the principal coordinate analysis significantly clustered samples by type (PERMANOVA test, p &lt; 0.05), while non-metric dimensional scaling did not (PERMANOVA test, p = 0.07). The overall analysis indicated a total of 95 phyla, 33 classes, 82 orders, 124 families, 202 genera, and 119 bacterial species. Four phyla, namely Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria collectively accounted for more than 97% of all sequencing reads from SCM and non-SCM cow samples. The most abundant bacterial classes were Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Gammaproteobacteria in non-SCM cow samples, whilst SCM cow samples were mainly composed of Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia, and Gammaproteobacteria. Dominant bacterial species in non-SCM cow samples were Anthropi spp., Pseudomonas azotoformans, P. fragi, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Enterococcus italicus, Lactococcus lactis, whilst P. azotoformans, Mycobacterium bovis, P. fragi, Acinetobacter guillouiae, and P. koreensis were dominant in the SCM cow samples. The current study found differences in bacterial species between SCM and non-SCM cow milk; hence, the need for detailed epidemiological studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-two noncastrated male lambs, crossbred Dorper &#215; Santa In&#234;s, with initial body weights (BWs) of 23 &#177; 0.1 kg and ages of 50 &#177; 5 days, were kept in individual pens and fed a diet composed of 6% Cynodon ssp. hay and 94% concentrate and subjected to four treatments: CON without inclusion of additives, addition of ACL 5 g/kg of dry matter (DM), addition of CCL 6.3 g/kg of DM, and addition of BZA 5 g/kg of DM. There was no effect of treatment or interaction with time on blood parameters (p &gt; 0.050), and performance characteristics, morphometry of ruminal papillae, and scores of cecum and rumen lesions were not affected by the addition of additives to the diet (p &gt; 0.050). Greater urinary acidification was observed in animals from CCL and ACL treatments (p = 0.033). Calcium chloride acidified the urinary pH and can be used instead of ammonium chloride at a concentration of 0.63% based on DM, when this is the objective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Calves are highly susceptible to neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD), which can be fatal. NCD is due to hypovolemia and acidosis, which may involve anorexia and ataxia. The One Health principle calls for a drastic reduction in antimicrobial use. One approach is to improve animal health and reduce the use of antibiotics and functional ingredients that have beneficial effects due to bioactive compounds. Several functional ingredients and additives can be considered, and, in particular for this study, Ascophyllum nodosum was considered. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of A. nodosum as a functional ingredient implemented into the milk replacer in neonatal calves. Twelve pre-weaned Holstein Frisian calves, housed in twelve individual pens in the same environmental conditions, were divided into two groups of six animals: a control group (CTRL, n = 6) fed with a milk replacer, and a treatment group receiving milk enriched with 10 g of A. nodosum in their diet (TRT, n = 6) for 42 days. The fecal score was evaluated daily (3-0 scale) to monitor the incidence of diarrhea in the two groups. The body weight was evaluated weekly, and every two weeks feces were collected for microbiological evaluation using a selective medium for plate counting of total, lactic acid, and coliform bacteria. To verify the presence of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Escherichia coli, real-time qPCR was used. At the beginning and at the end of the trial, blood samples were obtained for serum metabolite analysis. The growth performance did not differ in either of the two groups, but significant differences were observed in the incidence of moderate diarrhea (p-value &lt; 0.0113), where the TRT group showed a lower incidence of cases during the 42-day period. Serum analysis highlighted higher contents of albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and total cholesterol in the TRT group compared to CTRL (p-value &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, implementation of A. nodosum in the diet of calves can lead to better animal welfare and may reduce the use of antibiotics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In human medicine, MRI is used to investigate tonsillar diseases. In veterinary medicine, a recent study on healthy dogs described the MRI appearance of canine palatine tonsils, with no available reports about feline ones. Due to the similarities between animals and humans, and based on the study on canine tonsils, the authors aimed to evaluate the feasibility of low-field MRI to detect and describe presumed normal features of feline palatine tonsils, assessing the finding's reproducibility. Low-field MRI of the heads of 14 cats was reviewed, and qualitative findings (visualization, shape, margins, signal intensity, and pattern) and size of each tonsil were recorded. Each observer recorded 71% of the expected tonsils. Most of them were classified as oval, ill-defined, and hyperintense structures with both homogeneous and heterogeneous signal patterns; the overall agreement was considered good. Low-field MRI is potentially a useful imaging modality to visualize palatine tonsils in cats, and their normal appearance has been described for the first time. The authors recommend the evaluation of tonsils in the transverse plane and consider the most accurate estimation of the short axis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Affected dogs often receive high-dose glucocorticoid treatment, but the effect of such treatment alone on serum CRP concentrations is unknown. We evaluated serum CRP concentrations via immunoassay (sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay) in 12 healthy beagle dogs administered high-dose hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg q12 h) per os vs. placebo over 28 days (days 0, 1, 5, and 28) in a randomized parallel study design. Serum CRP concentrations slightly decreased during treatment or placebo but without a significant association with hydrocortisone administration (p = 0.761). Compared to baseline, serum CRP concentrations were decreased by &gt;2.7-fold (minimum critical difference) in three hydrocortisone-treated dogs and two dogs in the placebo group on day 28, whereas an increase to &gt;2.7-fold was seen in one dog receiving placebo. These results suggest a lack of confounding effects of high-dose hydrocortisone administration on serum CRP concentrations in healthy dogs. This might also hold in dogs with autoinflammatory conditions and/or administration of other high-dose corticosteroids, suggesting that CRP presents a suitable biomarker to monitor inflammatory disease processes. However, this needs confirmation by further studies evaluating corticosteroid-induced cellular (e.g., hepatic) transcriptome and proteome changes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37888573</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Biological Variation in Biochemistry Analytes in Laboratory Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus).</Title>	<Abstract>Biological variation (BV) describes the physiological random fluctuation around a homeostatic set point, which is a characteristic of all blood measurands (analytes). That variation may impact the clinical relevance of the changes that are observed in the serial results for an individual. Biological variation is represented mathematically by the coefficient of variation (CV) and occurs within each individual (CVI) and between individuals in a population (CVG). Biological variation data can be used to assess whether population-based reference or subject-based reference intervals should be used for the interpretation of laboratory results through the calculation of the index of individuality (IoI). This study aimed to determine the biological variations, calculate the IoI and reference change values (RCV) of clinical chemistry analytes in an outbred strain colony of Hartley guinea pigs (GPs), and set the quality specifications for clinical chemistry analytes. Blood was collected from 16 healthy adult laboratory colony GPs via jugular venipuncture at weekly intervals over six weeks. All the samples were frozen and analyzed in a single run. Analytical, CVI, and CVG biological variations, together with the IoI and RCV, were calculated for each measurand. Based on the estimated BV, the calculated IoI was low for glucose, so individual reference intervals (RCV) should be used. The majority of the measurands should be interpreted using both population-based and subject-based reference intervals as the IoIs were intermediate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nevertheless, studies incorporating feto-maternal monitoring in this species are uncommon. This review gathers research on the monitoring and evaluation of factors affecting rabbit gestation, providing a better understanding of the causes of prenatal development abnormalities. These include studies regarding how chronic maternal hypertension, gestational diabetes, maternal stress, ectopic gestation, maternal uterine ischemia and fetal hypoxia, intrauterine growth restriction, superfetation, maternal age, maternal nutritional status, maternal physical condition, maternal and embryonic genotype, and the intrauterine location of rabbit fetuses can potentially impact rabbits' reproduction and maternal and fetal health. Among other monitoring techniques, ultrasonography, considered one of the best tools for diagnosing pregnancy and conducting follow-up, is also reviewed. Details on measurable fetal-development parameters in rabbits and precautions to be considered before and during the examination are also provided. Additional studies are required to understand why some events occur and their consequences throughout gestation, allowing the determination of new biomarkers or cut-offs that can be helpful for early diagnosis and improve reproductive efficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Once developed in humans, these assays are often used in veterinary medicine without appropriately optimizing in the animal species of interest. In this study, two assays using AIS and o-D as substrates have been compared and validated for Cp oxidase activity assessment in horse's plasma. The optimization of the assays was performed mainly by varying the buffer pH as well as the buffer and the substrate molar concentration. Under the best analytical conditions obtained, the horse blood serum samples were treated with sodium azide, a potent Cp inhibitor. In the o-D assay, 500 &#181;M sodium azide treatment completely inhibits the enzymatic activity of Cp, whereas, using the AIS assay, a residual analytical signal was still present even at the highest (2000 &#181;M) sodium azide concentration. Even though the analytical values obtained from these methods are well correlated, the enzymatic activity values significantly differ when expressed in Units L[-1]. A disagreement between these assays has also been detected with the Bland-Altman plot, showing a progressive discrepancy between methods with increasing analytical values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ovarian dynamics were observed at every 12 h interval by using B mode ultrasonography, blood samples for hormonal analysis such as estradiol 17&#946; and progesterone were collected at every 12 h interval, and bucks with aprons were used to identify standing estrus at every 6 h interval. Relative to PGF2&#945;, the start of standing estrus and ovulation differ (p &lt; 0.05) between early- (n = 7), intermediate- (n = 6), and late-responding (n = 6) goats. The highest plasma level of estradiol 17&#946; was detected 12 h prior to ovulation. The average diameter of the ovulatory follicle and length of standing estrus were comparable (p &gt; 0.05) between the goats. The corpus luteum degenerated more quickly (p &lt; 0.05) in early- than intermediate- and late-responding goats. Dominant follicle diameter and estradiol 17&#946; concentration also differ (p &lt; 0.05) among groups. Although the plasma level of progesterone did not vary (p = 0.065), the variation in progesterone concentration with time differed (p &lt; 0.05) amongst the goats. As a result, this research indirectly reveals that the beginning of standing estrus, end of estrus, and ovulation after PGF2&#945; might fluctuate in Barbari goats because of follicular and hormonal dynamics during the luteal phase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The heterologous attenuated goat pox (GTPV) vaccine (AV41 strain) was used in China to prevent LSDV infection. Only a few LSDV detection methods that distinguish LSDV from GTPV vaccine strains have been reported before. For simple, rapid, and specific detection of LSDV, the real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method was established with the specific primers and probes designed according to the conserved regions of ORF132 gene sequences. The assay could be finished within 20 min at a constant temperature (39 &#176;C). This method had a limit of detection (LOD) of 15 copies/&#956;L for LSDV and no cross-reaction with the nucleic acids of goat pox virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, Pasteurella multocida, and bovine healthy tissue. Furthermore, 43 clinical samples were detected by this method and the real-time PCR recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), with a kappa value, was 0.94. These results demonstrated that the real-time RPA method for detecting LSDV developed in this study was characterized by high sensitivity and specificity, which has wide application value in the clinical diagnosis and detection of LSDV in China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 21-year-old female captive common hill mynah died without any notable clinical symptoms. An autopsy and histopathological examinations were conducted to determine the exact cause of death. On gross observation, the liver demonstrated a yellowish white surface color and multiple nodules indicating neoplastic lesions. Histopathological assessment found that the nodules purely comprised mature adipocytes. Furthermore, the liver exhibited an excessive accumulation of iron in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells and the infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells, suggesting iron storage disease (ISD). Based on the results, the present case was diagnosed as multiple hepatic lipomas with ISD. To the authors' best knowledge, multiple hepatic lipomas accompanying ISD lesions have not been reported previously. Hence, the present case is the first case report of hepatic multiple lipomas with ISD in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Australian veterinarians who had euthanised at least one cat during the previous 12 months were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. From 615 valid responses, 585 respondents (95.1%) had euthanised at least one cat in the last 12 months, of which 462 respondents (75.1%) had performed an emergency euthanasia. Intravenous (IV) injection (n = 536, 91.6%) of pentobarbitone sodium (n = 584, 99.8%) was the predominant primary method. Premedication or sedation was administered to cats by 415/585 (71.0%) and 242/462 (52.4%) of respondents in non-emergency and emergency euthanasia, respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, for non-emergency euthanasia, being female and working in a metropolitan area were significant predictors for administering a premedication or sedation (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.037, respectively). For emergency euthanasia, working in an 'other' type of practice was a significant predictor for administering a premedication or sedation (p &lt; 0.001). Australian veterinarians vary in their approach to feline euthanasia. There is scope for refinement of euthanasia techniques to maximise the welfare of cats, their owners or guardians, and veterinary team members.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Borrelia species are the responsible agents of borreliosis in poultry, animals and humans. Our previous studies have reported a high prevalence of Argas persicus infesting domestic fowls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. However, molecular screening and genetic characterization of Borrelia spp. in A. persicus have been neglected in Pakistan. In this study, we focused on the molecular epidemiology and genetic characterization of Borrelia spp. associated with A. persicus ticks infesting domestic fowls and ducks, and Carios vespertilionis infesting bats in selected districts of KP. Overall, 1818 ticks, including females (415; 23%), males (345; 19%), nymphs (475; 26%) and larvae (583; 32%), were collected from 27 locations in nine districts (Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Charsadda, Chitral, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Bajaur and Hangu) from domestic fowls, ducks and their shelters, and bats. A subset of 197 ticks was selected for DNA extraction and PCR to amplify fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase (cox) gene for ticks and flagellin B (flaB) for the detection and genetic characterization of associated Borrelia spp. Among these, only Borrelia anserina DNA was detected in 40 ticks (27.2%) of different life stages, where highest prevalence was found in female ticks (18; 45%), followed by nymphs (12; 30%), larvae (7; 17.5%) and males (3; 7.5%). Tick infestation in shelters (1081; 77%) was higher than on hosts (323; 23%). The resultant cox amplicons of A. persicus showed 100% identity with the same species reported from Pakistan, China, Iran, Kenya, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Egypt and C. vespertilionis show 100% identity with the species reported from Pakistan, China, Japan, Kenya, Vietnam, Spain, Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Hungry, and clustered with the aforementioned species in the phylogenetic tree. The obtained Borrelia sequences showed 100% identity with B. anserina and revealed a close resemblance to the relapsing fever group and clustered in a monophyletic clade with B. anserina from India, Iran and Brazil in a phylogenetic tree. These results establish the first molecular characterization of B. anserina in A. persicus infesting domestic fowls and ducks in the region, as well as their shelters. To effectively control zoonotic consequences, country-wide surveillance research should be encouraged to screen soft ticks infesting various birds for associated pathogens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of the current study was to describe the different management practices implemented in Egyptian dairies, which may influence mastitis and improve milk quality. An in-person survey was completed with herd managers and owners of 20 Egyptian dairies selected using a stratified random sample from four of Egypt's milk sheds. The questionnaire included 80 questions that inquired about herd demographics, mastitis status and control, milking practices, and management practices of the study dairies. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, multiple factor analysis (MFA), and hierarchical clustering to identify the important principal components and different dairy clusters. Of the surveyed herds, 69.50% had less than 500 lactating cows, with Holstein as the main cow breed. The reported average milk production on the study herds was 31.1 (SE &#177; 1.10) Kg/cow/day. Housing of lactating, dry, and close-up cows was in open lots. The majority of the dairies milked cows were three times per day (90.63%), the remaining milked cows four (5.00%) or a mix of four and three times per day. Furthermore, herringbone parlor design was the most common parlor design (66.79%) in the study dairies. The most common disinfectants used for both pre- and post-milking teat dip were iodine-based, 90.0% and 95.0%, respectively, while 52.16% of the dairies reported that their milkers wore gloves during milking. The reported mean annual percentage of mastitis was 52.3%, as a percent of the milking herd. The study dairies reported the inspection of udder health through either visual inspection (95.00%), udder hygiene score (86.88%), teat end score (71.88%), and/or using CMT (54.91%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were reported in 45.2% of the study herds. More than 50% of the study herds relied on importing pregnant cows or pregnant heifers as replacements. Multiple factor analysis identified 20 questions and represented 5 components of variability related to mastitis on dairies. The current survey of Egyptian dairies described the herd demographics and different management practices related to mastitis control and prevention. All the study dairies relied on the blanket intramammary antimicrobial drugs at dry off when current research elsewhere has identified selective dry cow therapy as an integral component of antimicrobial stewardship on dairies. Further research is required to identify the association between different management factors and the occurrence of mastitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Giant pandas consume different bamboo parts at different times, which provides the possibility of investigating how a single food source can affect the variation in the spread of ARGs. In this study, metagenomic analysis and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database were used to annotate ARGs and the differences in gut microbiota ARGs during the consumption of bamboo shoots, leaves, and culms by captive giant pandas. These ARGs were then compared to investigate the impact of bamboo part consumption on the spread of ARGs. The results showed that the number of ARGs in the gut microbiota of the subjects was highest during the consumption of bamboo leaves, while the variety of ARGs was highest during the consumption of shoots. Escherichia coli, which poses a higher risk of ARG dissemination, was significantly higher in the leaf group, while Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Raoultella were significantly higher in the shoot group. The ARG risk brought by bamboo shoots and leaves may originate from soil and environmental pollution. It is recommended to handle the feces of giant pandas properly and regularly monitor the antimicrobial and virulence genes in their gut microbiota to mitigate the threat of antibiotic resistance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to compare the CSF cytospin preparations obtained from automated and manual cytocentrifugation methods. A prospective case series was performed to analyze canine CSF samples using both centrifugation methods. The cytospins were processed within 30-60 min and prepared simultaneously in a conventional automated cytocentrifuge and in an in-house manual cytocentrifuge, using a fixed volume of CSF fluid. The cellularity, differential cell count and the proportion of cell artifacts (pseudopods and vacuolization) were blindly assessed in the cytospin preparations obtained using the two methods. The agreement and correlation between both methods were analyzed. There were 55 dogs enrolled (48 prospectively and 7 retrospectively) in the study. 38 dogs had normal total nucleated cell counts, while 17 had pleocytosis. Automated and manual cytocentrifugation had similar cell yields, and no significant differences in differential cell counts or the presence of artifacts existed between both methods. In cases with pleocytosis, the cytologic diagnosis obtained using each method was similar. Manual cytocentrifugation of CSF is a reliable and economic method designed for routine clinical practice. Its use reduces the specimen deterioration related to processing and analysis delays when samples are transported to external laboratories for evaluation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Of the 140 fecal samples previously tested for C. parvum, which were obtained from Hanwoo calves aged 60 days, 70 tested positive and 70 tested negative. These samples were included in this study. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis targeting the RdRp gene of CSpV1, we detected CSpV1 in 28 samples (20.0%), with infection rates of 31.4% (22/70) in C. parvum-positive and 8.6% (6/70) in C. parvum-negative samples. CSpV1 samples detected in the same farm were clustered together. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the prevalence and molecular characteristics of CSpV1 in Hanwoo calves in the Republic of Korea, providing important insights into the relationship between C. parvum and CSpV1 in bovine hosts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, a detailed biological characterization of bevacizumab in a variety of in vitro assays was carried out to determine the effect of bevacizumab on equine umbilical vein endothelial cells (EqUVEC). EqUVECs were harvested from umbilical cords of clinically healthy horses and exposed to different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 mg/mL) of bevacizumab (Avastin[&#174;]). Assays concerning the drug's safety (cell viability and proliferation assay) and efficacy (cell tube formation assay, cell migration assay, and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression) were carried out reflecting multiple cellular processes. Bevacizumab significantly decreased VEGF expression at all concentrations over a 72 h period. No cytotoxic effect of bevacizumab on EqUVECs was observed at concentrations of 4 mg/mL bevacizumab or lower. Incubated endothelial cells showed delayed tube formation and bevacizumab efficiently inhibited cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. Bevacizumab potently inhibits VEGF-induced cellular processes and could be a promising therapeutic approach in vascular-driven diseases in horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to determine if a sequentially increased IAP affects cardiovascular and respiratory variables in anesthetized dogs and evaluate the effects of the constant-rate infusion of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on cardiovascular and respiratory variables with increased IAP. Five dogs were anesthetized and instrumented, and a Veress needle was equipped to adjust the IAP using a carbon dioxide insufflator. Stabilization was conducted for 1 h, and physiological variables were measured at IAPs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mmHg and after desufflation. After the washout period, the dogs underwent similar procedures along with a constant-rate infusion of dexmedetomidine. The cardiovascular effects of increased IAP up to 20 mmHg were not significant in healthy beagle dogs and those administered with dexmedetomidine. When comparing the control and dexmedetomidine groups, the overall significant effects of dexmedetomidine were noted on heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance during the experiment. Respiratory effects were not observed during abdominal insufflation when compared between different IAPs and between the two groups. Overall, an increased IAP of up to 20 mmHg did not significantly affect cardiovascular and respiratory variables in both the control and dexmedetomidine groups. This study suggests that the administration of a dexmedetomidine infusion is applicable in laparoscopic procedures in healthy dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent research in veterinary medicine also supports its emergence as an animal pathogen. However, relevant data are limited. In this study, we obtained 41 A. baumannii isolates from clinical samples of canine and feline origin collected in veterinary clinics in Greece between 2020 and 2023. Biochemical identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, molecular identification and statistical analysis were performed. Most of the samples were of soft tissue and urine origin, while polymicrobial infections were recorded in 29 cases. Minocycline was the most effective in vitro antibiotic, whereas high resistance rates were detected for almost all the agents tested. Notably, 20 isolates were carbapenem resistant and 19 extensively drug resistant (XDR). This is the first report of canine and feline infections caused by Abc in Greece. The results create concerns regarding the capability of the respective bacteria to cause difficult-to-treat infections in pets and persist in veterinary facilities through hospitalized animals, contaminated equipment, and surfaces. Moreover, the prevalence of highly resistant strains in companion animals constitutes a public health issue since they could act as a reservoir, contributing to the spread of epidemic clones in a community.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999459</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular Survey of Rickettsia raoultii in Ticks Infesting Livestock from Pakistan with Notes on Pathogen Distribution in Palearctic and Oriental Regions.</Title>	<Abstract>Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasites that transmit different pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. to domestic and wild animals as well as humans. Genetic characterizations of Rickettsia spp. from different regions of Pakistan are mostly based on one or two genetic markers and are confined to small sampling areas and limited host ranges. Therefore, this study aimed to molecularly screen and genetically characterize Rickettsia spp. in various tick species infesting camels, sheep, and goats. All the collected tick specimens were morphologically identified, and randomly selected tick species (148) were screened molecularly for the detection of Rickettsia spp. by amplifying three rickettsial DNA fragments, namely, the citrate-synthase gene (gltA), outer-membrane protein A (ompA), and outer-membrane protein B (ompB). After examining 261 hosts, 161 (61.7%) hosts were found infested by 564 ticks, including 287 (50.9%) nymphs, 171 (30.3%) females, and 106 (18.8%) males in five districts (Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Lower Dir, Bajaur, and Mansehra). The highest occurrence was noted for Hyalomma dromedarii (number = 72, 12.8%), followed by Haemaphysalis sulcata (n = 70, 12.4%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (n = 64, 11.3%), Rhipicephalus microplus (n = 55, 9.7%), Haemaphysalis cornupunctata (n = 49, 8.7%), Hyalomma turanicum (n = 48, 8.5%), Hyalomma isaaci (n = 45, 8.0%), Haemaphysalis montgomeryi (n = 44, 7.8%), Hyalomma anatolicum (n = 42, 7.5%), Haemaphysalis bispinosa (n = 38, 6.7%), and Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides (n = 37, 6.6%). A subset of 148 ticks were tested, in which eight (5.4%) ticks, including four Hy. turanicum, two Ha. cornupunctata, one Ha. montgomeryi, and one Ha. bispinosa, were found positive for Rickettsia sp. The gltA, ompA, and ompB sequences revealed 100% identity and were phylogenetically clustered with Rickettsia raoultii reported in China, Russia, USA, Turkey, Denmark, Austria, Italy, and France. Additionally, various reports on R. raoultii from Palearctic and Oriental regions were summarized in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of R. raoultii from Pakistan. Further studies to investigate the association between Rickettsia spp. and ticks should be encouraged to apprise effective management of zoonotic consequences.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in the progression of various types of cancers in humans, involving tumor proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and signaling pathways, and acts as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and targeted treatment. However, research on lncRNAs related to canine tumors is in an early stage. Dogs have long been considered a promising natural model for human disease. This article summarizes the molecular function of lncRNAs as novel biomarkers in various types of canine tumors, providing new insights into canine tumor diagnosis and treatment. Further research on the function and mechanism of lncRNAs is needed, which will benefit both human and veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two previously validated PCR tests for Theileria followed by DNA sequencing were performed to test blood samples collected from 219 cattle in Alabama, USA, during the period of 2022-2023. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing revealed that the MPSP gene sequences (639-660 bp) from two cattle in Lee and Mobile Counties of Alabama exhibited a 100% match with those of recognized T. orientalis Ikeda strains, and showed similarities ranging from 76% to 88% with ten other T. orientalis genotypes. A high copy number of T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in the blood of infected cattle (ALP-1: 1.7 &#215; 10[5] and 1.3 &#215; 10[6]/mL whole blood, six months apart; ALP-2: 7.1 &#215; 10[6]/mL whole blood). Although the confirmed competent vector for T. orientalis Ikeda, Haemaphysalis longicornis tick, has not yet been identified in Alabama, the persistent nature of T. orientalis Ikeda infection and the detection of a high pathogen burden in seemingly healthy cattle in this study suggest that other tick species, as well as shared needles and dehorning procedures, could facilitate pathogen transmission within the herd. Continued investigations are necessary for the surveillance of T. orientalis Ikeda and Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks in Alabama and other U.S. states, along with assessing the pathogenicity of T. orientalis Ikeda infections in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Monitoring of 10 healthy pregnant bitches (2-8 years old, 8.8-40.3 kg bw) was conducted from -10 to 0 dbp using ultrasound. A single renal sonogram was obtained by scanning in a longitudinal section the three most caudal fetuses. The mean gray level (MGL) and SD of a manually drawn region of interest (ROI) in the renal cortex and medulla were measured using the Fiji Image J software (Image J 1.51h, Java 1.6 0_24 64 bit). A linear mixed model taking into account the maternal size as a fixed effect, dbp and litter size as covariates and the bitch as a random and repeated effect was used. The regression coefficients (b) were estimated. Cortical SD (C-SD) and cortico-medullary SD (C/M-SD) were influenced by dbp, with a significant decrease at the approaching day of parturition (b = 0.23 &#177; 0.06, p &lt; 0.001 and b = 0.5 &#177; 0.02, p = 0.038, respectively). Maternal size had a significant impact on C/M-MGL with differences observed in large-sized (1.95 &#177; 0.13) compared to small- (1.41 &#177; 0.10, p = 0.027) and medium-sized bitches (1.51 &#177; 0.09, p = 0.016). The C/M-MGL was influenced by litter size, showing a decrease as the number of pups increased (b = -0.08 &#177; 0.03, p = 0.018). C-SD and C/M-SD were exclusively affected by dbp, and not by maternal and litter size. This suggests their potential as valuable parameters, warranting further investigations in future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The occurrence of these apicomplexan agents in Sardinia has been poorly explored so far. In this study, the occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. has been investigated in domestic dogs from nine cities of Sardinia, Italy. Blood samples from each dog were collected and tested molecularly for the presence of Hepatozoon and Babesia/Theileria DNAs. Out of fifty-one dogs, nine were positive for Hepatozoon species based on the molecular detection of the parasite in blood samples. The phylogenetic relationships of strains detected here were also established. The PCR for amplification of the 18S rRNA fragment gene of Babesia/Theileria spp. did not give amplicons in any of the analyzed samples. Our results report the first molecular confirmation of Hepatozoon canis in Sardinian pet dogs and contribute to better understand the presence of these protozoans on the island. This study highlights the importance of recognizing and predicting the risk levels for the canine population, thus increasing the development of specific control measures. Also, since the distribution of hepatozoonosis is closely related to that of the definitive tick host, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, more accurate studies on Rhipicephalus ticks will be needed due to increasing the epidemiological knowledge of Hepatozoon species on the island.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three groups of male Alentejano pigs (n = 10 each) were raised between ~40 and 160 kg LW. Group C included pigs that were surgically castrated, while the I group included intact ones; both were fed with commercial diets. The third group, IExp, included intact pigs that were fed commercial diets until ~130 kg, then replaced by an experimental diet based on legumes and agro-industrial by-products between ~130 and 160 kg. Fecal samples were collected two weeks before slaughter. The total DNA was extracted and used for 16S metabarcoding on a MiSeq[&#174;] System. The dietary transition from a commercial diet to the experimental diet substantially increased and shifted the diversity observed. Complex carbohydrate fermenting bacteria, such as Ruminococcus spp. and Sphaerochaeta spp., were significantly more abundant in IExp (q &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, castrated pigs presented a significantly lower abundance of the potential probiotic, Roseburia spp. and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (q &lt; 0.01), bacteria commonly associated with better gut health and lower body fat composition. Understanding the role of gut microbiota is paramount to ensure a low skatole deposition and consumers' acceptance of pork products from non-castrated male pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>37999466</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Unveiling Oxidative Stress-Induced Genotoxicity and Its Alleviation through Selenium and Vitamin E Therapy in Naturally Infected Cattle with Lumpy Skin Disease.</Title>	<Abstract>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a contagious infection of cattle caused by a virus of the Poxviridae family, genus Capripoxvirus. In Pakistan, recent outbreaks have resulted in significant nationwide mortality and economic losses. A 20-day prospective cohort study was performed on sixty infected cattle with the aim to evaluate LSD-induced oxidative stress's genotoxic role and to determine the ameliorative effect of antioxidant therapy using principal component analysis (PCA) and a multivariable ordinal logistic regression model. LSDV was identified from scab samples and nodular lesions using RPO30-specific gene primers. The infected cattle were divided into control and treated groups. The animals were observed initially and finally on day 20 to evaluate the homeostatic, oxidative, and genotoxic changes. The animals in the treated group were administered a combination of selenium (Se) and vitamin E at the standard dose rate for five consecutive days. A substantial (p &lt; 0.05) improvement in the hematological indices was observed in the treated group. The treated group also showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in levels of serum nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) post-therapy. The PCA at the final sampling data of the treated group showed that Principal Component (PC1 eigenvalue 1.429) was influenced by superoxide dismutase (SOD; 0.3632), catalase (CAT; 0.2906), and glutathione (GSH; 0.0816) and PC2 (eigenvalue 1.200) was influenced by CAT (0.4362), MDA (0.2056), and NO (0.0693). A significant correlation between serum NO (76%) and MDA levels (80%) was observed with genetic damage index (GDI) scores. The ordinal logistic regression model regarding the use of antioxidant therapy revealed 73.95-times (95%CI; 17.36-314.96) improvement in the GDI in treated animals. The multivariable ordinal logistic regression showed that each unit increase in NO and MDA resulted in a 13% increase in genotoxicity in infected individuals. In conclusion, our study revealed that LSD-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation product causes genotoxicity in affected animals. Furthermore, the combined Se and vitamin E therapy significantly alleviated oxidative stress and genotoxicity in LSD-affected cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999467</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effect of Sampling Method on Detection of the Equine Uterine Microbiome during Estrus.</Title>	<Abstract>Bacterial endometritis is among the most common causes of subfertility in mares. It has a major economic impact on the equine breeding industry. The sensitivity of detecting uterine microbes using culture-based methods, irrespective of the sample collection method, double-guarded endometrial swab, endometrial biopsy, or uterine low-volume lavage (LVL), is low. Therefore, equine bacterial endometritis often goes undiagnosed. Sixteen individual mares were enrolled, and an endometrial sample was obtained using each method from all mares. After trimming, quality control and decontamination, 3824 amplicon sequence variants were detected in the dataset. We found using 16S rRNA sequencing that the equine uterus harbors a distinct resident microbiome during estrus. All three sampling methods used yielded similar results in composition as well as relative abundance at phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota) and genus (Klebsiella, Mycoplasma, and Aeromonas) levels. A significant difference was found in alpha diversity (Chao1) between LVL and endometrial biopsy, suggesting that LVL is superior at detecting the low-abundant (rare) taxa. These new data could pave the way for innovative treatment methods for endometrial disease and subfertility in mares. This, in turn, could lead to more judicious antimicrobial use in the equine breeding industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999468</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Economic Aspects of Bovine Ephemeral Fever (BEF) Outbreaks in Dairy Cattle Herds.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by blood-feeding insects (mosquitoes and Culicoides biting midges). While the dispersal of arboviral diseases such as bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) into naive areas is often the result of globalization and animal movement, the endemization and local outbreaks of these diseases are mainly influenced by environmental changes. Climate change affects the activity, distribution, dynamics, and life cycles of these vectors (arthropods), the replication of viruses within their vectors, and weakens animal's immune systems. Although BEF does not currently occur in the Americas and Europe (other than in the western regions of Turkey), the risk of BEFV emergence, spread, and endemization in Europe is real. Over the past two decades, arboviruses such as the bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) have emerged in Europe without warning and caused significant losses to the dairy and meat industries. Since the European cattle population has never been exposed to BEFV, the economic losses to dairy and beef production in this continent due to the reduction in milk production, loss of valuable cows, and abortion, should BEF emerge, would probably be considerable. Moreover, arboviruses can also cause substantial financial damage due to restrictions on animal trade and transportation, like the current EHDV-8 outbreak in the Mediterranean basin. In this study, we used national data stored in the Israeli herd book to examine the economic aspects of BEF outbreaks in affected dairy cattle farms countrywide. Our results demonstrate that BEF outbreaks can have immediate and delayed effects, causing severe economic losses due to culling (loss of valuable cows) and a reduction in milk production that affects dairy farm income for months after clinical diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive study on the impact of a BEF outbreak at a population level, enabling to conduct accurate risk assessments in future cases of BEFV emergence and re-emergence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ejaculates were collected once by digital manipulation from 39 male dogs aged between 2 and 4 years and older. The first and third fractions of the ejaculate were centrifuged at 5000&#215; g for 30 min, and supernatants were stored at -80 &#176;C for further analysis of OPN using a double-antibody sandwich method (SEA899CA, Cloude-Clone Corp, Houston, TX, USA). Meanwhile, the second fractions were evaluated for sperm motility, concentration, viability, and rate of abnormal spermatozoa (head, acrosome, midpiece and tail abnormalities). The average concentration of OPN was 8.7 &#177; 5.2 ng/mL, and it differed significantly between the 1st 10.4 &#177; 5.3 ng/mL and 3rd 7.4 &#177; 5 ng/mL fractions. According to ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis, the OPN concentration had a better diagnostic ability for sperm motility (p &lt; 0.001) than for the rate of abnormal spermatozoa (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the OPN concentration was negatively correlated with poor sperm morphology and motility. In conclusion, the OPN concentration in prostate-derived secretions may be a possible marker of sperm quality in dogs. Further research could explore the involvement of OPN in sperm motility during cryopreservation and in vivo fertility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective of this study was to describe the rotation alar fold flap technique and to report clinical outcomes in a short case series. The feasibility of the technique was first assessed in a canine cadaveric model. The rotation alar fold flap was obtained by a single sharp horizontal incision of the dorsolateral nasal cartilage, preserving the caudal mucosal attachment to the ventral nasal concha. The flap was then rotated ventro-medially for the reconstruction of the ventral aspect of the nasal planum unilaterally or bilaterally. The rotation alar fold flap technique was used following a subtotal or partial planectomy for excision of a squamous cell carcinoma or mast cell tumors in three dogs. No intraoperative complications were recorded. Superficial surgical site infection was reported in two cases and minor dehiscence was reported in one case. However, survival of the flap was not affected. The cosmetic and functional outcomes were considered very satisfactory in all cases. The rotation alar fold flap technique offers a safe, valuable, feasible, functional and aesthetically satisfactory alternative surgical option for selected cases of localized tumor involving the central and ventral planum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, it was purposed to synthesize new benzimidazole-triazole derivatives and evaluate their antileishmanial activities. The targeted compounds (5a-5h) were obtained after five chemical reaction steps. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by spectral data. The possible in vitro antileishmanial activities of the synthesized compounds were evaluated against the Leishmania tropica strain. Further, molecular docking and dynamics were performed to identify the probable mechanism of activity of the test compounds. The findings revealed that compounds 5a, 5d, 5e, 5f, and 5h inhibited the growth of Leishmania tropica to various extents and had significant anti-leishmanial activities, even if some orders were higher than the reference drug Amphotericin B. On the other hand, compounds 5b, 5c, and 5g were found to be ineffective. Additionally, the results of in silico studies have presented the existence of some interactions between the compounds and the active site of sterol 14-alpha-demethylase, a biosynthetic enzyme that plays a critical role in the growth of the parasite. Therefore, it can be suggested that if the results obtained from this study are confirmed with in vivo findings, it may be possible to obtain some new anti-leishmanial drug candidates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999472</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Environmental Cadmium Exposure Perturbs Gut Microbial Dysbiosis in Ducks.</Title>	<Abstract>Ore extraction, chemical production, and agricultural fertilizers may release significant amounts of heavy metals, which may eventually accumulate widely in the environment and organisms over time, causing global ecological and health problems. As a recognized environmental contaminant, cadmium has been demonstrated to cause osteoporosis and renal injury, but research regarding the effects of cadmium on gut microbiota in ducks remains scarce. Herein, we aimed to characterize the adverse effects of cadmium on gut microbiota in ducks. Results indicated that cadmium exposure dramatically decreased gut microbial alpha diversity and caused significant changes in the main component of gut microbiota. Moreover, we also observed significant changes in the gut microbial composition in ducks exposed to cadmium. A microbial taxonomic investigation showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Proteobacteria were the most preponderant phyla in ducks regardless of treatment, but the compositions and abundances of dominant genera were different. Meanwhile, a Metastats analysis indicated that cadmium exposure also caused a distinct increase in the levels of 1 phylum and 22 genera, as well as a significant reduction in the levels of 1 phylum and 36 genera. In summary, this investigation demonstrated that cadmium exposure could disturb gut microbial homeostasis by decreasing microbial diversity and altering microbial composition. Additionally, under the background of the rising environmental pollution caused by heavy metals, this investigation provides a crucial message for the assessment of environmental risks associated with cadmium exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The piglets (N = 120) were blocked by weight (5.22 &#177; 0.7 kg) and sex. The pens (n = 5/treatment) within a block were randomly assigned to diets in a 2 &#215; 3 factorial design to examine the effects of Se (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg added Se) and Mn (0, 12, and 24 mg/kg added Mn) and were fed in three phases (P1 = d 1-7, P2 = d 8-21, P3 = d 22-35). The pigs and orts were weighed weekly. Fecal samples were collected d 0 and 35 for 16S rRNA bacterial gene sequencing and VFA analysis. The data were analyzed as factorial via GLM in SAS. There was a linear response (p &lt; 0.05) in overall ADG across dietary Mn. Supplementing 24 mg/kg Mn tended to decrease (p &lt; 0.10) the relative abundance of many bacteria possessing pathogenic traits relative to Mn controls. Meanwhile, increasing Mn concentration tended to foster the growth of bacteria correlated with gut health and improved growth (p &lt; 0.10). The data from this study provide preliminary evidence on the positive effects of manganese on growth and gut health of nursery pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Consequently, researchers intensified their efforts to investigate radiation's effects using animal models and to study disease models that emerged post-catastrophe. As a result, several parameters have been established as essential in these models, encompassing radiation doses, regimens involving single or multiple irradiations, the injection site for transplantation, and the quantity of cells to be injected. Nonetheless, researchers have observed numerous side effects in irradiated animals, prompting the development of scoring systems to monitor these animals' well-being. The aim of this review is to delve into the historical context of using animals in radiation research and explore the ethical considerations related to animal welfare, which has become an increasingly relevant topic in recent years. These concerns have prompted research groups to adopt measures aimed at reducing animal suffering. Consequently, for animal welfare, the implementation of a scoring system for clinical and behavioral monitoring is essential. This represents one of the primary challenges and hurdles in radiation studies. It is concluded that implementing standardized criteria across all institutions is aimed at ensuring result reproducibility and fostering collaboration within the scientific community.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to investigate people's emotional responses toward pictures of farm animals kept in intensive and extensive husbandry systems, their perception of animal welfare, and their choices as animal product consumers. A questionnaire that included demographic questions and photos of cows, pigs, chickens, and rabbits in both intensive and extensive systems was distributed electronically and physically and completed by 835 respondents. Photos of animals in intensive systems elicited more negative emotions, especially for pigs and rabbits (p &lt; 0.05), as opposed to extensive systems, which elicited more positive emotions, especially for chickens (p &lt; 0.001). Higher welfare levels were perceived for extensively farmed animals (p &lt; 0.001) and for cattle compared to all other species, regardless of the husbandry system (p &lt; 0.001). The quality of the emotional response was positively associated with welfare perception (p &lt; 0.001) and negatively associated with the importance given to welfare when purchasing animal products (p &lt; 0.001). Finally, the emotional response was found to be affected by gender, education, household composition, living area, pet ownership, and eating habits. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999476</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The Relationship between Mastitis and Antimicrobial Peptide S100A7 Expression in Dairy Goats.</Title>	<Abstract>S100A7 is an inflammation-related protein and plays an essential role in host defenses, yet there is little research about the relationship between mastitis and S100A7 expression in dairy goats. Here, according to the clinical diagnosis of udders, SCC, and bacteriological culture (BC) of milk, 84 dairy goats were grouped into healthy goats (n = 25), subclinical mastitis goats (n = 36), and clinical mastitis goats (n = 23). The S100A7 concentration in subclinical mastitis goats was significantly upregulated than in healthy dairy goats (p = 0.0056) and had a limited change with clinical mastitis dairy goats (p = 0.8222). The relationship between log10 SCC and S100A7 concentration in milk was positive and R = 0.05249; the regression equation was Y = 0.1446 &#215; X + 12.54. According to the three groups, the log10 SCC and S100A7 were analyzed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve; in subclinical mastitis goats, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of log10 SCC was 0.9222 and p &lt; 0.0001, and the AUC of S100A7 concentration was 0.7317 and p = 0.0022, respectively; in clinical mastitis goats, the AUC of log10 SCC was 0.9678 and p &lt; 0.0001, and the AUC of S100A7 concentration was 0.5487 and p = 0.5634, respectively. In healthy goats, S100A7 was expressed weakly in the alveolus of the mammary gland of healthy goats while expressed densely in the collapsed alveolus of mastitis goats. Moreover, S100A7 expression increased significantly in mastitis goats than in healthy dairy goats. In this research, results showed the effects of mastitis on the S100A7 expression in the mammary gland and S100A7 concentration in milk and the limited relationship between SCC and mastitis, which provided a new insight into S100A7's role in the host defenses of dairy goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Studies in human cancers demonstrated that Doxorubicin presents a good effect in different biological processes like apoptosis, autophagy, the cell cycle, cell invasion, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This study followed the effects of Doxorubicin on two canine mammary cancer cell lines P114 and CMT-U27. Doxorubicin treatment in both cell lines shows an inhibitory effect in cell proliferation and an alteration in expression of the EMT-related genes. The obtained results provide valuable information for revealing the link between Doxorubicin, phenotypic changes, and proliferation dynamics in canine mammary tumor models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999478</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effects of Low Protein Diet on Production Performance and Intestinal Microbial Composition in Pigs.</Title>	<Abstract>In order to study the effects of a low protein diet on the production performance and intestinal microbiota composition of Hexi pigs, twenty-seven Hexi pigs with an initial body weight of 60.50 &#177; 2.50 kg were randomly divided into three groups (control group (CG), group 1 (G1), and group 2 (G2)) and participated in a 60-day finishing trial. The CG was fed a normal protein level diet with a protein level of 16.0%, and G1 and G2 were fed a low protein level diet with protein levels of 14.0% and 12.0%, respectively. The results showed that the low protein level diet had no significant effect on the production performance of Hexi pigs, compared with the CG, the slaughter rate of G1 and G2 increased by 2.49% (p &gt; 0.05) and 6.18% (p &gt; 0.05), the shear force decreased by 2.43% (p &gt; 0.05) and 15.57% (p &gt; 0.05), the cooking loss decreased by 24.02% (p &lt; 0.05) and 21.09% (p &gt; 0.05), and the cooking percentage increased by 13.20% (p &gt; 0.05) and 11.59% (p &gt; 0.05). From 45 min to 24 h and 48 h after slaughter, each group of pH decreased by 1.02, 0.66, and 0.42. For muscle flesh color, the lightness (L) increased by 13.31% (p &gt; 0.05) and 18.01% (p &gt; 0.05) in G1 and G2 and the yellowness (b) increased by 7.72% (p &gt; 0.05) and 13.06% (p &gt; 0.05). A low protein level diet can improve the intestinal flora richness and diversity of growing and finishing pigs. In the jejunum, the ACE index (899.95), Simpson index (0.90), and Shannon (4.75) index were higher in G1 than in the other groups, but the Chao1 index (949.92) was higher in G2 than in the remaining two groups. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Verrucomicrobia were significantly higher in G1 than in the CG. The relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Terrisporobacter, and Megasphaera in G1 was significantly higher than in the CG (p &lt; 0.05). In the cecum, the ACE index (900.93), Chao1 index (879.10), Simpson index (0.94), and Shannon (5.70) index were higher in G1 than in the remaining groups. The Spirochaetes in G2 were significantly higher than in the other groups, but the Verrucomicrobia was significantly lower than in the other groups. The relative abundances of Lactobacillus were higher in G1 and G2 than in the CG (p &gt; 0.05). The relative abundances of unidentified_Clostridiales and Terrisporobacter in G2 were significantly lower than in the CG (p &lt; 0.05). The relative abundance of Turicibacter in G1 was significantly lower than in the CG (p &lt; 0.05).

A total of thirty-two canine patients with pelvic fractures of different origins were treated. To provide a better reference for the frames used, an alphanumeric classification system was developed, detailing the frame structure and the number and location of the pins used. In this study, eighty-six fractures were treated in the 32 patients of this work, with an average fixation time of 9.88 &#177; 4.15 weeks. No major complications were detected in this case cohort, and the outcomes were rated at 9.46 based on a visual assessment scale for the patient's comfort during treatment. Outcomes graded as excellent and good were 96%. The use of external fixation for stabilization of pelvic fractures should be considered as a technical option, especially for minimally invasive stabilization of complex fractures, either as a primary or secondary stabilization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37999480</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Intestine Health and Barrier Function in Fattening Rabbits Fed Bovine Colostrum.</Title>	<Abstract>The permeability of the immature intestine is higher in newborns than in adults; a damaged gut barrier in young animals increases the susceptibility to digestive and infectious diseases later in life. It is therefore of major importance to avoid impairment of the intestinal barrier, specifically in a delicate phase of development, such as weaning. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of bovine colostrum supplementation on the intestinal barrier, such as the intestinal morphology and proliferation level and tight junctions expression (zonulin) and enteric nervous system (ENS) inflammation status (through the expression of PGP9.5 and GFAP) in fattening rabbits. Rabbits of 35 days of age were randomly divided into three groups (n = 13) based on the dietary administration: commercial feed (control group, CTR) and commercial feed supplemented with 2.5% and 5% bovine colostrum (BC1 and BC2 groups, respectively). Rabbits receiving the BC1 diet showed a tendency to have better duodenum morphology and higher proliferation rates (p &lt; 0.001) than the control group. An evaluation of the zonulin expression showed that it was higher in the BC2 group, suggesting increased permeability, which was partially confirmed by the expression of GFAP. Our results suggest that adding 2.5% BC into the diet could be a good compromise between intestinal morphology and permeability, since rabbits fed the highest inclusion level of BC showed signs of higher intestinal permeability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It not only impacts their quality of life but also that of their owners. Like human atopic dermatitis (hAD), cAD has a complex pathogenesis, including genetic and environmental factors. Current treatments focus on managing clinical signs, but they can be costly and have limitations. This article emphasizes the importance of preventing cAD from developing in the first place. Understanding the role of the skin's protective barrier is crucial, as its dysfunction plays a vital role in both hAD and cAD. hAD prevention studies have shown promising results in enhancing the skin barrier, but more research is needed to support more robust conclusions. While hAD primary prevention is currently a focal point of intensive investigation in human medicine, research on cAD primary prevention remains under-researched and almost non-existent. Pioneering effective prevention strategies for cAD holds immense potential to enhance the quality of life for both dogs and their owners. Additionally, it bears the promise of a translational impact on human research. Hence, further exploration of this crucial topic is not only relevant but also timely and imperative, warranting support and encouragement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, our understanding of burns and their severity in koalas is limited; hence, this study investigated the histopathological features and depth of burns in koala skin, as well as the presence of smoke-induced respiratory tract damage. In four bushfire-affected koalas that had been euthanised on welfare grounds, skin burns in various body regions were scored based on clinical appearance as superficial, partial thickness, or full thickness. Histological sections of affected regions of skin were assessed as Grades I-IV and showed that furred regions on the ear margins and dorsum were histologically more severe, at Grade III, compared with the clinical score. There was a similar finding for footpad burns, which were the most common body region affected. In the respiratory tract, pulmonary oedema and congestion were evident in all koalas. Overall, the results highlight that cutaneous burn lesions on furred and palmar/plantar surfaces can have higher severity based on the burn depth than is clinically apparent. Therefore, there is a need to consider this when developing treatment plans and establishing prognosis for burnt koalas at triage, as well as that a high likelihood of pulmonary oedema exists.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hence, reconstruction of the cardiac tissue comes at the forefront of strategies adopted to restore heart functions following MI. In this investigation, we studied the capacity of rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (r-AdMSCs) and decellularized porcine pericardium (DPP) to restore heart functions in MI animals. MI was induced in four different groups, three of which were treated either using DPP (MI-DPP group), stem cells (MI-SC group), or both (MI-SC/DPP group). Cardiac functions of these groups and the Sham group were evaluated using echocardiography, the intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG) on weeks 2 and 4, and intraventricular hemodynamics on week 4. On day 31, the animals were euthanized for histological analysis. Echocardiographic, IVPG and hemodynamic findings indicated that the three treatment strategies shared effectively in the regeneration process. However, the MI-SC/DPP group had a unique synergistic ability to restore heart functions superior to the other treatment protocols. Histology showed that the MI-SC/DPP group presented the lowest (p &lt; 0.05) degeneration score and fibrosis % compared to the other groups. Conclusively, stem cell-seeded DPP is a promising platform for the delivery of stem cells and restoration of heart functions post-MI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its transmission cycle in nature includes wild birds as amplifying hosts and ornithophilic mosquito vectors. The aim of this study was to assess WNV circulation among wild birds from two regions of Greece, Peloponnese and Western Greece, during 2022. To this end, a total of 511 birds belonging to 37 different species were sampled and molecularly screened. WNV RNA was detected from February to November in a total of 71 wild birds of nine species originating from both investigated regions. The first eight positive samples were sequenced on a part of NS3 and, according to the phylogenetic analysis, they belonged to evolutionary lineage 2 and presented similarity to previous outbreak-causing Greek strains (Argolis 2017, Macedonia 2010 and 2012). It was more likely to identify a PCR positive bird as the population density and the distance from water sources decreased. The present report provides evidence of WNV occurrence in both Peloponnese and Western Greece during 2022 and underlines its possible overwintering, highlighting the need for avian species surveillance to be conducted annually and throughout the year. Magpies are proposed as sentinels for WNV monitoring.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we report a case of melanoma with neurological impairment without evidence of cutaneous neoplastic lesions in an adult buffalo in the state of Par&#225;, Brazil. Clinically, the buffalo exhibited apathy, decreased mandibular tone, and occasionally an open mouth with motor incoordination, and eventually succumbed to the condition. Necropsy revealed multifocal tumor masses in the brain, pituitary gland, trigeminal ganglion, and spinal cord. The neoplastic cells showed strong positive signals for vimentin, Melan-A, PNL-2, and SOX10. The diagnosis was made via necropsy, histopathology, and positive immunostaining for Melan-A and PNL-2, which are specific markers for melanocyte identification.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Studies are scarce on reservoirs (hiding places) and routes of entry of S. aureus into the food supply chain in Ethiopia. To fill these gaps, we evaluated the role of cows (milk), meat, equipment, and food handlers on the abundance and AMR of S. aureus in five geographical areas in central Oromia, Ethiopia. We isolated S. aureus from 10 different ecologies per area in 5 areas and tested their sensitivity to 14 antimicrobials of 9 different classes. We ranked the 5 areas and 10 ecologies by computing their multiple AMR index (MARI) at a cut-off value of 0.2 to determine 'high-risk' ecologies for AMR. We recorded as MDR if an isolate had resistance to &#8805;3 antimicrobial classes. We used a circos diagram to analyze if isolates with identical AMR patterns were shared between different ecologies. S. aureus is prevalent in central Oromia (16.1-18.3%), higher in dairy farms than in abattoirs, and varied among 10 ecologies (p &lt; 0.001) but not among 5 areas (p &gt; 0.05). Of the 92 isolates, 94.6% were penicillin-resistant. Their AMR prevalence was above 40% for 9 of 14 antimicrobials. All isolates (100%) had AMR in at least one antimicrobial class (range = 1-9; median = 5), indicating MDR was prevalent. The prevalence of MDR S. aureus varied (p &lt; 0.05) among areas and 10 ecologies; the highest was in slaughter lines. All isolates had a MARI of &gt;0.2, indicating drug overuse, and S. aureus's AMR burden is high in central Oromia. Dairy farms had higher MARI values (0.44) than abattoirs (0.39). Of 10 ecologies, the highest and lowest MARI values were in the beef supply chain, i.e., slaughter line (0.67) and butcher's hand (0.25). Of the 68 different AMR patterns by 92 isolates against 14 antimicrobials, 53 patterns (77.9%) were unique to individual isolates, indicating they were phenotypically dissimilar. MDR S. aureus was widespread in central Oromia in dairy and meat supply chains, contaminating milk, meat, equipment, and workers in farm and abattoir settings. In the absence of strict regulations and interventions, MDR S. aureus can be disseminated from these epicenters to the public.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Treatment-na&#239;ve, client-owned dogs with a cyto/histological diagnosis of advanced pulmonary carcinoma, selected from a laboratory database and previously subjected to imaging, were enrolled in the study. Vinorelbine (15 mg/m[2]) was administered weekly for 4 weeks and then fortnightly until progressive disease was documented. Staging work-up was repeated by means of diagnostic imaging after the fourth VRL (i.e., 28 days) and monthly thereafter; response to treatment was evaluated according to the RECIST. Toxicity was graded following the VCOGC group. Ten dogs met the inclusion criteria. Partial response was documented in eight dogs. Median time to progression was 88 days (range: 7-112) and median survival time for all dogs was 100 days (range 7-635). The most common side effect was neutropenia. The main limitations of the study were the absence of histological diagnosis in eight cases and the limited number of treated dogs. VRL is well tolerated with an adequate toxicity profile and may be useful in the management of advanced lung tumours if used as a first-line treatment strategy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is caused by Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv), one of three subspecies of Campylobacter fetus. Bulls are the reservoir but BGC may also be spread by artificial insemination (AI). BGC is characterized by severe reproductive losses such as infertility, early embryonic death and abortion with considerable economic losses. This significant economic impact has prompted several countries to adopt stringent eradication and surveillance measures to contain the disease. While there are commercial and autologous vaccines available, scientific evidence for the effectiveness of vaccination is still lacking. In Germany, BCG was already found to be endemic in the 1920s, shortly after the agent and the disease had been described for the first time. It can be assumed that BCG had already circulated uncontrolled for a long time in the predecessor states of Germany, influenced only by the political situation and trading networks of the time. After WW II, BCG was eradicated in the German Democratic Republic due to industrialized cattle production based on AI but it was still endemic at low levels in the Federal Republic of Germany with its diverse cattle production. There has been a steady decline in BGC incidence in re-unified Germany over the past 28 years. A single genetic Cfv lineage was identified which probably emerged in the 19th century and diversified over time. Interestingly, no recurrent cross-border introduction became evident. This review gives insight into the history of bovine genital campylobacteriosis considering the structural change in cattle farming in Germany and reflecting on the political background of the time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cell therapy, which uses mesenchymal stem cells due to their tissue differentiation properties and anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects, aims to restore damaged tissue. In this manuscript, we performed a systematic review using the Parsifal tool, searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases for articles on regenerative medicine for equine musculoskeletal injuries. Our review covers 17 experimental clinical studies categorized by the therapeutic approach used: platelet-rich plasma, conditioned autologous serum, mesenchymal stem cells, and secretome. These therapies reduce healing time, promote regeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissue, improve cellular organization, and improve joint functionality and sustainability. In conclusion, regenerative therapies using platelet-rich plasma, conditioned autologous serum, equine mesenchymal stem cells, and the emerging field of the secretome represent a promising and highly effective approach for the treatment of joint pathologies in horses, implying a valuable advance in equine healthcare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) have shown potential beneficial effects as GI protectants. This study aimed to evaluate the gastroprotective effects of oral GAGs in rats with indomethacin-induced GI lesions. Forty-five Sprague-Dawley rats (8-9 weeks-old, 228 &#177; 7 g) were included in the study, divided into five study groups, and given, administered orally, either sucralfate (positive control group; PC), NAG (G group), sodium alginate plus HA and CS (AHC group), sodium alginate plus HA, CS, and NAG (AHCG group), or no treatment (negative control group; NC). Animals were administered 12.5 mg/kg indomethacin orally 15 min after receiving the assigned treatment. After 4 h, stomach samples were obtained and used to perform a macroscopic evaluation of gastric lesions and to allow histological assessment of the gastric wall (via H/E staining) and mucous (via PAS staining). The AHCG group showed significant gastroprotective improvements compared to the NC group, and a similar efficacy to the PC group. This combination of sodium alginate with GAGs might, therefore, become a safe and effective alternative to prescription drugs for gastric lesions, such as sucralfate, and have potential usefulness in companion animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The patients were divided in two groups based on the heart remodeling after closure: Group A included dogs that had a reduction in the end-systolic volume index (ESVI) after closure compared to the ESVI measured before; Group B included dogs without a reduction in ESVI after closure. Body weight, minimal ductal diameter (MDD) of PDA, end-diastolic volume index and presence of arrhythmias at presentation were significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A. The shortening fraction and ejection fraction after closure were reduced in both groups, but in Group B there was a major reduction, and the mean values indicated a possible systolic dysfunction. Complications during the procedure and death due to cardiac reasons were greater in Group B compared to Group A. In conclusion, a higher body weight, a larger MDD, a more severe heart enlargement or arrhythmias at presentation increased the risk of developing a worsening structural and functional condition after ductal closure, and this can be associated with perioperative complications and cardiac death.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, the cat possessed IgG anti-core, a common indicator of chronic HBV infection in human patients and did not show seroconversion to the anti-DCH surface antigen, considered protective during HBV infection and associated with long-term protective immunity. On genome sequencing, the DCH strain showed 98.3% nucleotide identity to strains previously identified in Italy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study examined plasma PCT and PCC levels in healthy cows (H) and cows with subclinical mastitis (SCM). A total of 130 cows (65 H and 65 SCM) were included in this study. Blood samples were collected, and plasma was frozen at -80 &#176;C. PCT levels were determined using a bovine procalcitonin ELISA kit, while PCC was measured following the methodology of Levine et al. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in PCT levels between H (75.4 pg/mL) and SCM (107.3 pg/mL) cows (p &lt; 0.001) and significantly lower concentrations of PCC in the SCM group (H: 0.102 nmol/mL/mg, SCM: 0.046 nmol/mL/mg; p &lt; 0.001). The PCT cut-off value for distinguishing healthy and subclinical mastitis animals was &gt;89.8 pg/mL (AUC 0.695), with a sensitivity of 66.2% and specificity of 69.2%. PCT showed potential value as a diagnostic tool to help in decision making for subclinical mastitis cases, while PCC requires further studies to investigate the trend of this biomarker during localized pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three-week-old commercial broiler chickens (in total 62) were included and randomly allocated into three infected test groups and one control group. Each test group was inoculated intranasally/intratracheally with one of the three H9N2 isolates at a dose of 10[8] EID50 virus. The control group received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via the same route of application. The pathogenicity was evaluated based on clinical signs and gross pathological and histopathological lesions, the viral antigen load was assessed through immunohistochemistry staining (IHC), and a semi-quantitative detection of the genetic material was conducted via a real-time PCR. Our findings confirmed the obvious respiratory tract tropism of the virus strains with variable renal tropism. In contrast to the highly pathogenic AIVs, the tested H9N2 strains did not show replication in the central nervous system. The virus presence and lesions, mainly in the respiratory tract, were predominant on dpi 5 and significantly reduced or disappeared by dpi 11. A clear difference was demonstrated among the three isolates: the A/chicken/Morocco/2021/2016 strain proved to be significantly more virulent than the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian ones, which showed no remarkable difference.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this purpose, 63 Nellore bulls, born from cows submitted to three nutritional plans, were used: not programmed (NP), which did not receive protein supplementation; partially programmed (PP), which had protein-energy supplementation (0.3% of mean body weight of each batch) only in the final third of pregnancy; and full programming (FP), which received supplementation (0.3% of mean body weight of each batch) throughout pregnancy. The averages of parameters were submitted to the ANOVA, and the supplementation periods, which were different when p value &lt; 0.05, were compared. Carcass weights and rib eye area (REA) did not differ between treatments (p &gt; 0.05), but subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) showed a tendency (p = 0.08) between groups. For lipids and marbling, no differences were found (p &gt; 0.05). In the analyses of maturation time and shelf life, no difference was observed between treatments. However, there was a tendency between treatments at 14 days of maturation time for cooking loss (CL) (p = 0.08). Treatments did not affect shear force in the progenies (p &gt; 0.05). Fetal programming had no effect on the meat quality of Nellore bulls.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133224</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Influence of the Anatomical Site on Adipose Tissue-Derived Stromal Cells' Biological Profile and Osteogenic Potential in Companion Animals.</Title>	<Abstract>Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) have generated considerable interest in the field of veterinary medicine, particularly for their potential in therapeutic strategies focused on bone regeneration. These cells possess unique biological characteristics, including their regenerative capacity and their ability to produce bioactive molecules. However, it is crucial to recognize that the characteristics of ADSCs can vary depending on the animal species and the site from which they are derived, such as the subcutaneous and visceral regions (SCAT and VAT, respectively). Thus, the present work aimed to comprehensively review the different traits of ADSCs isolated from diverse anatomical sites in companion animals, i.e., dogs, cats, and horses, in terms of immunophenotype, morphology, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation potential. The findings indicate that the immunophenotype, proliferation, and osteogenic potential of ADSCs differ according to tissue origin and species. Generally, the proliferation rate is higher in VAT-derived ADSCs in dogs and horses, whereas in cats, the proliferation rate appears to be similar in both cells isolated from SCAT and VAT regions. In terms of osteogenic differentiation potential, VAT-derived ADSCs demonstrate the highest capability in cats, whereas SCAT-derived ADSCs exhibit superior potential in horses. Interestingly, in dogs, VAT-derived cells appear to have greater potential than those isolated from SCAT. Within the VAT, ADSCs derived from the falciform ligament and omentum show increased osteogenic potential, compared to cells isolated from other anatomical locations. Consequently, considering these disparities, optimizing isolation protocols becomes pivotal, tailoring them to the specific target species and therapeutic aims, and judiciously selecting the anatomical site for ADSC isolation. This approach holds promise to enhance the efficacy of ADSCs-based bone regenerative therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133225</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Website Investigation of Pet Weight Management-Related Information and Services Offered by Ontario Veterinary Practices.</Title>	<Abstract>Pet owners rely on information and advice from their veterinary practice to effectively manage their pet's weight. This study investigated weight management information and services displayed on practice websites in Ontario, Canada. Information collected from the websites of 50 randomly selected small and mixed-animal practices included practice and staff demographics and the type of weight management services, products, and information advertised or displayed. The most frequently advertised weight management service and product were nutritional counselling (34%) and therapeutic diets (25%), respectively. Current bodyweight measurement was advertised on just over half of the websites (54%), while physical therapy counselling was the least-advertised service (16%). Further statistical analyses were performed in an exploratory fashion to determine areas for future research. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the association between practice demographics and the type of weight management information advertised online. A maximum of two predictor variables were included in each regression model. Exploratory analyses indicated that when controlling for the number of veterinarians in each practice, having a higher number of veterinary technicians was associated with increased odds of a practice website advertising current bodyweight measurement by 80.1% (odds ratio (OR) = 1.80, p = 0.05). Additionally, when controlling the number of veterinary technicians, having a higher number of veterinarians was associated with increased odds of a practice website advertising sales of therapeutic diets by 119.0% (OR = 2.19, p = 0.04). When using corporate practices as reference, independently owned practices had decreased odds of advertising sales of treats and weight management accessories on their practice websites by 78.7% (OR = 0.21, p = 0.03). These preliminary results suggest that advertising weight management information is not prioritized on veterinary practice websites in Ontario, especially those with lower staff numbers. The findings of this study raise awareness on the current state of weight management promotion for pets on veterinary practice websites and highlight ways to improve upon a practice's online presence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Commercially available ELISAs were used to detect specific antibodies to the food-borne zoonotic parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spp., as well as to Neospora caninum, in serum samples of pigs slaughtered at Egypt's only licensed pig abattoir, the El-Bassatin abattoir in Cairo. Among the tested sera (n = 332), seroreactivity for T. gondii was 45.8% (95% confidence interval: 40.4-51.3), N. caninum was 28.0% (95% CI: 23.3-33.2), and Trichinella spp. was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.4-3.3). Mixed infection was only detected for T. gondii and N. caninum (18.7%; 95% CI: 14.7-23.4). The seroprevalence of T. gondii was significantly higher (p = 0.0003) in animals collected from southern Cairo (15 May city slum) than in eastern Cairo (Ezbet El Nakhl slum). Seroprevalence for N. caninum was higher in western (Manshiyat Naser slum; p = 0.0003) and southern Cairo (15 May city slum; p = 0.0003) than in that of eastern Cairo (Ezbet El Nakhl slum; p = 0.0003). Moreover, female pigs exhibited a higher rate of N. caninum antibodies than male ones (p &lt; 0.0001). This study provides the first seroprevalence data for N. caninum in pigs in Egypt, and updates the prevalence of the zoonotic parasites Trichinella spp. and T. gondii.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Western countries, most infections are asymptomatic. However, acute self-limiting hepatitis and chronic cases in immunocompromised individuals can occur. Studying HEV is challenging due to its difficulty to grow in cell culture. Consequently, the detection of the virus mainly relies on RT-qPCR, which cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious particles. To overcome this problem, methods assessing viral integrity offer a possible solution to differentiate between intact and damaged viruses. This study aims at optimizing existing HEV cell culture models and RT-qPCR-based assays for selectively detecting intact virions to establish a reliable model for assessing HEV infectivity. In conclusion, these newly developed methods hold promise for enhancing food safety by identifying approaches for inactivating HEV in food processing, thereby increasing food safety measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Some phytogenic blends (PB) positively affect the production performance, inhibit pathogens within the gut microbiota, and improve the overall health of farm animals. In this study, a swine large intestine in vitro model was used to evaluate the effect of two PBs, alone or in combination with casein, on swine gut microbiota. As a result, the combination of casein with PB1 had the most beneficial effects on swine gut microbiota, as it increased the relative abundance of some commensal bacteria and two genera (Lactobacillus and Oscillospiraceae UCG-002), which are associated with greater production performance in pigs. At the same time, supplementation with PBs did not lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens, indicating their safety for pigs. Both PBs showed fewer changes in swine gut microbiota compared to interventions with added casein. In contrast, casein supplementation significantly increased beta diversity and the relative abundance of commensal as well as potentially beneficial bacteria. In conclusion, the combination of casein with PBs, in particular PB1, had the most beneficial effects among the studied supplements in vitro, with respect to microbiota modulation and metabolite production, although this data should be proven in further in vivo studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this purpose, 600 Ross-308 broiler chicks were allocated at 22 days of age into five groups (G1-G5), each comprising six groups of 20 birds each. Chickens kept in G1 (negative control) were fed a basal diet and raised at 26 &#177; 1 &#176;C. Chickens kept in G2 to G5 were exposed to periodic heat stress (35 &#177; 1 &#176;C for 9 h/day) from 22 to 35 days old. Chickens in G2 (positive control) were provided a basal diet, while G3, G4, and G5 were fed a basal diet enriched with SP (1 g/kg diet), GP (200 mg/kg diet), or SP/GP (1 g SP/kg + 200 mg GP/kg diet), respectively. The assessment parameters included the chickens' performance, malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity, blood biochemistry, intestinal morphology, and modulation of lactobacilli and total coliforms in the intestinal microbiota. Our findings demonstrated that supplementing heat-stressed chickens with SP and/or GP significantly mitigated the negative effects on the European production efficiency index (EPEF), survival rate, cholesterol profile, and oxidative stress markers. Chickens supplemented with GP and/or SP exhibited significantly better EPEF and survivability rates. Heat stress had a significant impact on both the gut structure and gut microbiota. However, SP and/or GP supplementation improved the gut morphology, significantly increased the intestinal lactobacilli, and reduced the coliform contents. It was also found that the simultaneous feeding of SP and GP led to even higher recovery levels with improved lipid metabolites, immunity, and oxidative status. Overall, supplementing chickens with SP and/or GP can alleviate the negative effects of heat stress.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133230</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Estimating Microbial Protein Synthesis in the Rumen-Can 'Omics' Methods Provide New Insights into a Long-Standing Question?</Title>	<Abstract>Rumen microbial protein synthesis (MPS) provides at least half of the amino acids for the synthesis of milk and meat protein in ruminants. As such, it is fundamental to global food protein security. Estimating microbial protein is central to diet formulation, maximising nitrogen (N)-use efficiency and reducing N losses to the environment. Whilst factors influencing MPS are well established in vitro, techniques for in vivo estimates, including older techniques with cannulated animals and the more recent technique based on urinary purine derivative (UPD) excretion, are subject to large experimental errors. Consequently, models of MPS used in protein rationing are imprecise, resulting in wasted feed protein and unnecessary N losses to the environment. Newer 'omics' techniques are used to characterise microbial communities, their genes and resultant proteins and metabolites. An analysis of microbial communities and genes has recently been used successfully to model complex rumen-related traits, including feed conversion efficiency and methane emissions. Since microbial proteins are more directly related to microbial genes, we expect a strong relationship between rumen metataxonomics/metagenomics and MPS. The main aims of this review are to gauge the understanding of factors affecting MPS, including the use of the UPD technique, and explore whether omics-focused studies could improve the predictability of MPS, with a focus on beef cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133231</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Antibiotic Resistance Genes Carried by Commensal Escherichia coli from Shelter Cats in Italy.</Title>	<Abstract>Antimicrobial resistance is a widespread global health problem. The presence of resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes has been demonstrated not only in humans but also in animals, including pets. Stray cats share the urban environment with people and pets. This may facilitate transmission of resistant bacteria and resistance genes between stray animals, people and domestic animals. Several studies have investigated the role of stray cats as a fecal carrier of ESBL-producing bacteria. However, there are many genes and resistance mechanisms that can be detected in commensal E. coli, which, because of its genetic plasticity, is considered an indicator for monitoring antibiotic resistance. In this study, rectal swabs were collected from stray cats from colonies and shelters in the city of Monza (Monza Brianza, Italy) to isolate commensal E. coli. Phenotypic tests, such as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the double disc test (DDST), and molecular analyses to detect antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were used to study the resistance of these isolates. The results obtained confirm that stray cats can carry ESBL-producing E. coli (6.7%) and genes conferring resistance to other important antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines and sulfonamides.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this study, we report the identification of prototheca in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a cat with neurological symptoms. Fourteen CSF samples were gathered from cats presented with neurological disease between 2012 and 2014. The inclusion criteria for the samples were an increase in CSF protein and cell number (pleocytosis), suggestive of an infectious inflammatory status of the central nervous system (CNS). Nine samples fulfilled the inclusion criteria (inflammatory samples), while five samples, used as control, did not (non-inflammatory samples). All the samples were screened molecularly for different pathogens associated with CNS disease in cats, including prototheca. Out of 14 CSF samples, only one inflammatory sample tested positive for prototheca. Upon sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the amplicon, the strain was characterized as P. bovis. This report is the first documented evidence of prototheca in the cerebrospinal fluid of a cat with neurological signs. Prototheca should be considered in the diagnostics procedures on the CNS of cats presented with infectious diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sturgeon is a suitable species for surgical experiments due to its industrial significance. Maintaining homeostasis is crucial during surgical procedures, and the liver plays a major role in immune regulation. High temperature is suggested to improve physiological activity and wound healing. This study investigated differences in hepatectomy sturgeons' tolerance and histopathological responses of internal organs. Moreover, this study investigated the effects of high temperatures on wound healing and hematopoietic recovery in fish undergoing surgical procedures. The liver condition was found to play a pivotal role in the analysis, and cortisol levels were affected by anesthesia. The results showed that high temperature facilitated hematopoietic recovery and wound healing, but excessive induction of physiological activity caused damage. Managing high temperatures and liver conditions induced a remarkable improvement in wound healing. However, anesthesia itself can be a significant stressor for fish, and wound healing requires a greater amount of energy. Further research is needed to understand the stress factors caused by surgical procedures and anesthesia and to promote animal welfare in fishery products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hyalomma spp., found across Africa, Asia, and Europe, are especially problematic. This study explored biocontrol of Hyalomma spp. using spore-free fungal culture filtrates collected from dairy farm soil in Kohat, Pakistan. Three fungal species of the genera Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Penicillium were isolated, and their filtrates were tested against tick adults and larvae. Filtrate concentrations were prepared at different strengths. Data were taken after the exposure of adults and larvae ticks to various concentrations of the fungal filtrates. Results indicated that at 100% concentration, all fungal filtrates induced 100% mortality in adults and larvae. Decreasing filtrate concentration lowered tick mortality. The lowest concentration caused the least mortality. The effect was time- and dose-dependent. In conclusion, spore-free fungal culture filtrates can provide biocontrol of Hyalomma spp. in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Further research should explore the active compounds causing mortality and optimal application methods. The process outlined here provides a natural biocontrol alternative to chemical pesticides to reduce tick infestations and associated cattle diseases in Pakistan.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This review aims to provide an overview of various technologies based on ultrasound, from the basic B-Mode ultrasonography to the more recent advancements, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and ultrasound elastography (UEl), all of which are utilized in the evaluation of canine testicles. The review outlines the principles behind each of these technologies and discusses their application in assessing normal and abnormal testicular conditions. B-mode canine testicular ultrasonography primarily focuses on detecting focal lesions but has limitations in terms of objectivity. Other technologies, including Doppler ultrasonography, B-Flow, and CEUS, allow for the characterization of vascular patterns, which could be further measured using specific applications like spectral Doppler or quantitative CEUS. Additionally, ultrasound elastography enables the assessment of parenchyma stiffness both qualitatively and quantitatively. These ultrasound-based technologies play a crucial role in andrology by providing valuable information for evaluating testicular function and integrity, aiding in the identification of pathological conditions that may impact the health and quality of life of male dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mmm causes contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), which is a severe respiratory disease widespread in sub-Saharan Africa but eradicated in several countries, including China. M. bovis is an important cause of the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD), characterized worldwide by pneumonia, arthritis, and mastitis. Secreted proteins of bacteria are generally considered virulence factors because they can act as toxins, adhesins, and virulent enzymes in infection. Therefore, this study performed a comparative proteomic analysis of the secreted proteins of M. bovis and Mmm in order to find some virulence-related factors as well as discover differential diagnostic biomarkers for these bovine mycoplasmas. The secretome was extracted from both species, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used, which revealed 55 unique secreted proteins of M. bovis, 44 unique secreted proteins of Mmm, and 4 homologous proteins. In the M. bovis secretome, 19 proteins were predicted to be virulence factors, while 4 putative virulence factors were identified in the Mmm secretome. In addition, five unique secreted proteins of Mmm were expressed and purified, and their antigenicity was confirmed by Western blotting assay and indirect ELISA. Among them, Ts1133 and Ts0085 were verified as potential candidates for distinguishing Mmm infection from M. bovis infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The PCs consist mainly of supraphysiological concentrations of platelets and, therefore, growth factors (GFs) which are stored within platelet &#945;-granules. Among PCs, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is characterised by low-density fibrin. Research on the effect of PCs in cattle has surged in recent years; in particular, evidence has shown the positive use of PRP for treating reproductive problems, in vitro production of bovine embryos, sole ulcers and udder diseases. The aim of this report is to critically review, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, the available literature reporting clinical application in the bovine practice of PRP. Three bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were used for a broad search of "platelet concentrates" OR "PRP" OR "platelet-rich plasma" OR "PRF" OR "platelet-rich fibrin" AND "cows" OR "cattle". From 1196 papers, only six met the inclusion criteria. Two papers described the use of PRP in mastitis, two papers in uterine dysfunction and two papers in ovarian dysfunction. PRP offered a low-cost, easily obtained therapeutic option and showed positive results for these patients. However, given the different pathologies and definitions involved, further studies are necessary to assess its full clinical potential.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Bladder rupture due to urethral obstruction with calculi was the principal finding during the necropsy of the pigs. An in-depth diagnostic examination was performed to elucidate possible pathophysiological mechanisms, namely Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR) analysis of the uroliths, blood analysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 10 samples) for assessing concentrations of minerals, the bone resorption marker cross-linked C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D components, biochemical urinalysis (farm A: 5 samples, farm B: 7 samples), microscopic examination of urinary sediment (Farms A and B: 7 samples each), mineral composition of the feed, and analysis of the drinking water. Calcium carbonate was the main component found in stones from both farms, and calcium carbonate and struvite were the main components found in crystals from farms A and B, respectively. On farm A, urinary calcium excretion and urinary pH were high; on farm B, urinary phosphorus was high and urinary calcium was low with a normal urinary pH. The mineral compositions of the feed and drinking water were similar on both farms and could therefore not explain the difference between the two farms. Disturbances in calcium and phosphorus absorption and homeostasis might have been involved in these problems. Further research should focus on the calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the feed and take into account other factors, such as the absorption and excretion of minerals due to gut and urinary microbiota.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of PCV3 in a boar stud. The objectives were to detect PCV3 in semen, as well as matched serum, oral fluid, and preputial fluid samples from adult boars using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), analyze PCV3-IgG antibody data, and genetically characterize a positive sample. A total of 112 samples from 28 boars were collected from a large-scale pig farm in Guangxi, China. The qPCR results showed that the PCV3 DNA was not detected in semen, with a positive rate of 0% (0/28), while it was detected in serum (3.57%-1/28), oral fluid (64.28%-18/28), and preputial fluid (46.4%-13/28). The seropositivity rate of PCV3-IgG in serum was 82.14% (23/28) according to the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) results. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the PCV3 isolates belonged to the PCV3c clades. This is the first report of PCV3 detection in preputial fluid from boars. The results suggest that PCV3 is transmitted among boars on pig farms and exhibits epidemic characteristics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Implemented in the form of multiplexed total DNA metagenomics or as total RNA sequencing, the approach produces comprehensive and actionable reports that allow semi-quantitative identification of most of the agents present in respiratory, cloacal, and tissue samples. The diagnostic benefits of the use of direct tNGS and ntNGS are high specificity, compatibility with different types of clinical samples (fresh, frozen, FTA cards, and paraffin-embedded), production of nearly complete infection profiles (viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites), production of "semi-quantitative" information, direct agent genotyping, and infectious agent mutational information. The achievements of NGS in terms of diagnosing poultry problems are described here, along with future applications. Multiplexing, development of standard operating procedures, robotics, sequencing kits, automated bioinformatics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are disciplines converging toward the use of this technology for active surveillance in poultry farms. Other advances in human and veterinary NGS sequencing are likely to be adaptable to avian species in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133242</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Obesity during Pregnancy in the Horse: Effect on Term Placental Structure and Gene Expression, as Well as Colostrum and Milk Fatty Acid Concentration.</Title>	<Abstract>In horses, the prevalence of obesity is high and associated with serious metabolic pathologies. Being a broodmare has been identified as a risk factor for obesity. In other species, maternal obesity is known to affect the development of the offspring. This article is a follow-up study of previous work showing that Obese mares (O, n = 10, body condition score &gt; 4.25 at insemination) were more insulin resistant and presented increased systemic inflammation during pregnancy compared to Normal mares (N, n = 14, body condition score &lt; 4 at insemination). Foals born to O mares were more insulin-resistant, presented increased systemic inflammation, and were more affected by osteoarticular lesions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of maternal obesity on placental structure and function, as well as the fatty acid profile in the plasma of mares and foals, colostrum, and milk until 90 days of lactation, which, to our knowledge, has been poorly studied in the horse. Mares from both groups were fed the same diet during pregnancy and lactation. During lactation, mares were housed in pasture. A strong heat wave, followed by a drought, occurred during their 2nd and 3rd months of lactation (summer of 2016 in the Limousin region, France). In the present article, term placental morphometry, structure (stereology), and gene expression (RT-qPCR, genes involved in nutrient transport, growth, and development, as well as vascularization) were studied. Plasma of mares and their foals, as well as colostrum and milk, were sampled at birth, 30 days, and 90 days of lactation. The fatty acid composition of these samples was measured using gas chromatography. No differences between the N and O groups were observed for term placental morphometry, structure, or gene expression. No difference in plasma fatty acid composition was observed between groups in mares. The plasma fatty acid profile of O foals was more pro-inflammatory and indicated an altered placental lipid metabolism between birth and 90 days of age. These results are in line with the increased systemic inflammation and altered glucose metabolism observed until 18 months of age in this group. The colostrum fatty acid profile of O mares was more pro-inflammatory and indicated an increased transfer and/or desaturation of long-chain fatty acids. Moreover, O foals received a colostrum poorer in medium-chain saturated fatty acid, a source of immediate energy for the newborn that can also play a role in immunity and gut microbiota development. Differences in milk fatty acid composition indicated a decreased ability to adapt to heat stress in O mares, which could have further affected the metabolic development of their foals. In conclusion, maternal obesity affected the fatty acid composition of milk, thus also influencing the foal's plasma fatty acid composition and likely participating in the developmental programming observed in growing foals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133243</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Bidirectional Patellar Luxation in Small- or Miniature-Breed Dogs in Japan; Patient Characteristics and Radiographic Measures Compared with Medial Patellar Luxation.</Title>	<Abstract>Bidirectional patellar luxation (BPL) is a relatively rare form of patellar luxation, with limited information reported regarding breed predisposition and etiology. The purpose of this study was to describe the patient characteristics and radiographic measures of proximodistal patellar position associated with BPL in dogs in Japan, compared with dogs with medial patellar luxation (MPL). A retrospective medical record search of surgically corrected MPL and BPL dogs was performed, and breed, age, sex, body weight, and presence of the patella alta in the extended-stifle position were recorded. The ratio of the patellar ligament length to patella length (PLL/PL) and the ratio of the distance between the proximal pole of the patella and the femoral condyle to patella length (A/PL) were measured on stifle radiographs. A total of 35 dogs with BPL and 95 dogs with MPL were included. The BPL was most commonly present in Toy Poodles (odds ratio compared to MPL dogs: 7.05) in the present study. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or body weight between the BPL and MPL groups. Patella alta in the extended-stifle position was more common in the BPL group (23.4%) than in the MPL group (0.8%). However, there were no significant differences in PLL/PL or A/PL between the BPL and MPL groups. The study highlights BPL in different dog breeds in Japan, and suggests that the occurrence of BPL may be related to stifle extension. However, more research is needed to fully understand the etiology of BPL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133244</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Snapshot of the Phylogenetic Relationships among Avian Poxviruses Circulating in Portugal between 2017 and 2023.</Title>	<Abstract>Avipoxvirus (APV), a linear dsDNA virus belonging to the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of the family Poxviridae, infects more than 278 species of domestic and wild birds. It is responsible for causing avian pox disease, characterized by its cutaneous and diphtheric forms. With a high transmission capacity, it can cause high economic losses and damage to the ecosystem. Several diagnostic methods are available, and bird vaccination can be an effective preventive measure. Ten APV-positive samples were analyzed to update the molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of viruses isolated in Portugal between 2017 and 2023. A P4b gene fragment was amplified using a PCR, and the nucleotide sequence of the amplicons was determined using Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained were aligned using ClustalW, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed. With this study, it was possible to verify that the analyzed sequences are distributed in subclades A1, A2, B1, and B3. Since some of them are quite similar to others from different countries and obtained in different years, it is possible to conclude that there have been several viral introductions in Portugal. Finally, it was possible to successfully update the data on Avipoxviruses in Portugal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the presence of Giardia duodenalis and different Giardia assemblages detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and the occurrence of certain clinical signs. All the dogs included (n = 82) were clinically examined, and fecal samples were examined for other parasites and Clostridium spp. Also, G. duodenalis assemblages were detected and the occurrence of certain clinical signs was assessed. A total of 42/82 (51.2%) dogs were symptomatic and had one or more gastrointestinal signs, and 40/82 (48.8%) dogs were asymptomatic. G. duodenalis was found in 25/82 (30.5%) dogs: assemblage C in 10/25 (40%) and assemblage D in 15/25 (60%). Only Cryptosporidium spp. showed a higher coinfection rate with G. duodenalis but that did not have an influence on clinical sign appearance. There was no correlation between the presence of different assemblages of G. duodenalis and the sex of the host or the duration and appearance of certain clinical signs, except the presence of mucus in feces, which was more frequent in dogs invaded with G. duodenalis assemblage C. Further research of other assemblages is needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different EOGO inclusion levels were evaluated to assess the dose response and potential effects of the mixture. Three EOGO inclusion levels (0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL/kg of incubated dry matter) were evaluated in vitro, while four treatments (0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL/day of EOGO and a control group) were tested in vivo on 12 West African sheep. A randomized controlled trial was conducted using a 4 &#215; 4 design. Blood parameters (glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and &#946;-hydroxybutyrate) were measured to observe the effect of EOGO on the metabolism. The results showed that the inclusion of EOGO significantly enhanced IVDMD at low levels (p &lt; 0.052) compared with the highest levels in treatments containing 0.5 and 0.75 mL/kg of EOGO dry matter. A higher intake of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (p &lt; 0.05) was observed in the in vivo diets with the inclusion of EOGO. In terms of in vivo apparent digestibility, significant differences were found among treatments in the digestibility coefficients of DM, CP, and NDF. EOGO inclusion increased the digestibility of DM. CP digestibility displayed a cubic effect (p &lt; 0.038), with the lowest values of digestibility observed at 1 mL EOGO inclusion. Additionally, NDF digestibility showed a cubic effect (p &lt; 0.012), with the highest value obtained at 0.75 mL of EOGO inclusion. The inclusion levels above 0.75 mL EOGO showed a cubic effect, which indicates that higher concentrations of EOGO may not be beneficial for the digestibility of CP and NDF. Although no significant difference was observed in total digestible nutrients, a linear trend was observed (p &lt; 0.059). EOGO improved the intake of DM, CP, and NDF. EOGO supplementation improved the digestibility of DM and NDF, with optimal levels observed at 0.5 mL/day. No significant effects were observed in the blood parameters. These results suggest that EOGO has the potential as an additive in ruminal nutrition to improve food digestibility and serve as an alternative to antibiotic additives. The use of EOGO potentially improves fiber digestion and may reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock production. Garlic (A. sativum) and oregano (O. vulgare) essential oils effectively modulated fiber digestibility at 0.75 mL/day. Garlic (A. sativum) and oregano (O. vulgare) essential oils have the potential to improve digestibility at low inclusion levels and serve as an alternative to antibiotic additives. The effectiveness of essential oils is greater in a mixture and at lower doses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The dogs walked on the pressure-sensitive walkway before (T0) and 30 (T1), 90 (T2), and 120 (T3) days after surgery. Pressure measurements (gait lameness score and total pressure index %) were collected for S (treated with porous TTA) and C (healthy contralateral limb) at T0, T1, T2, and T3 and statistically evaluated. An ANOVA test was performed to compare the data, and a value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Twenty dogs (n = 20) of various common breeds and ages with CrCLR were enrolled in the study. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the GAIT4Dog[&#174;] lameness score (GLS) and TPI% between S and C for each timepoint. Statistically significant differences in the GLS and TPI% between S at T0 and S at T2 and between S at T0 and S at T3 (p &lt; 0.001) were found. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the GAIT4Dog[&#174;] lameness score (GLS) and TPI% between S and C for each timepoint. Statistically significant differences in the GLS and TPI% between S at T0 and S at T2 and between S at T0 and S at T3 were found. The GLS and TPI% increased statistically significantly from 90 days after surgery compared to the preoperative measurements. Moreover, comparing the GLS and TPI% between the treated limb and the control limb showed that a statistically significant difference remained at each timepoint.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The results suggested that canine leptospirosis is now endemic in the study area. A longer distance to the nearest veterinary hospital (RR 0.118, 95% CI -4.205--0.065, p &lt; 0.05) and a mildly compromised Index of Economic Resources (IER) (RR 0.202, 95% CI -3.124--0.079, p &lt; 0.05) were significant protective factors against leptospirosis. In areas proximal to the clinical cases and seropositive samples, the presence of tree cover was a strong risk factor for higher odds of canine leptospirosis (OR 5.80, 95% CI 1.12-30.11, p &lt; 0.05). As the first study exploring risk factors associated with canine leptospirosis in urban Sydney, our findings indicate a potential transmission from urban green spaces and the possibility of higher exposure to Leptospira-or increased case detection and reporting-in areas adjacent to veterinary hospitals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After gamete fusion, PLCZ1 triggers calcium oscillations in the oocyte, resulting in oocyte activation. In assisted fertilization, oocyte activation failure is a major cause of low fertility. Most cases of oocyte activation failures in humans related to male infertility are associated with gene mutations and/or altered PLCZ1. Consequently, PLCZ1 evaluation could be an effective diagnostic marker and predictor of sperm fertilizing potential for in vivo and in vitro embryo production. The characterization of PLCZ1 has been principally investigated in men and mice, with less known about the PLCZ1 impact on assisted reproduction in other species, such as cattle and horses. In horses, sperm PLCZ1 varies among stallions, and sperm populations with high PLCZ1 are associated with cleavage after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In contrast, bull sperm is less able to initiate calcium oscillations and undergo nuclear remodeling, resulting in poor cleavage after ICSI. Advantageously, injections of PLCZ1 are able to rescue oocyte failure in mouse oocytes after ICSI, promoting full development and birth. However, further research is needed to optimize PLCZ1 diagnostic tests for consistent association with fertility and to determine whether PLCZ1 as an oocyte-activating treatment is a physiological, efficient, and safe method for improving assisted fertilization in cattle and horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133250</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Microbiota Characterization of the Cow Mammary Gland Microenvironment and Its Association with Somatic Cell Count.</Title>	<Abstract>Subclinical mastitis is a common disease that threatens the welfare and health of dairy cows and causes huge economic losses. Somatic cell count (SCC) is the most suitable indirect index used to evaluate the degree of mastitis. To explore the relationship between SCC, diversity in the microbiome, and subclinical mastitis, we performed next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of cow's milk with different SCC ranges. The data obtained showed that the microbiota was rich and coordinated with SCC below 2 &#215; 10[5]. SCC above 2 &#215; 10[5] showed a decrease in the diversity of microbial genera. When SCC was below 2 &#215; 10[5], the phylum Actinobacteriota accounted for the most. When SCC was between 2 &#215; 10[5] and 5 &#215; 10[5], Firmicutes accounted for the most, and when SCC exceeded 5 &#215; 10[5], Firmicutes and Proteobacteria accounted for the most. Pathogenic genera such as Streptococcus spp. were absent, while SCC above 2 &#215; 10[5] showed a decrease in the diversity of microbial genera. SCC was positively correlated with the percentage of Romboutsia, Turicibacter, and Paeniclostridium and negatively correlated with the percentage of Staphylococcus, Psychrobacter, Aerococcus, and Streptococcus. Romboutsia decreased 6.19 times after the SCC exceeded 2 &#215; 10[5]; the SCC increased exponentially from 2 &#215; 10[5] to 5 &#215; 10[5] and above 1 &#215; 10[6] in Psychrobacter. Analysis of the microbiota of the different SCC ranges suggests that the development of mastitis may not only be a primary infection but may also be the result of dysbiosis in the mammary gland.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133251</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Hematologic Abnormalities and Diseases Associated with Moderate-to-Marked Basophilia in a Large Cohort of Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Basophilia is a rare hematologic finding in dogs. This research aimed to describe the hematologic and clinical characteristics of dogs with moderate-to-marked basophilia. CBC reports with blood smear examinations from dogs presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital were retrospectively reviewed for basophilia (&gt;193 cells/&#181;L). We classified basophilia as moderate when counts were &#8805;500 cells/&#181;L and marked when they reached &#8805;1000 cells/&#181;L. We compared the hematologic and clinical profiles of dogs with moderate-to-marked basophilia (the basophilia group) to those without basophilia, serving as our control group. In addition, we investigated differences between dogs with marked basophilia versus those with moderate basophilia, as well as between dogs in the basophilia group with and without concurrent eosinophilia. Diseases associated with moderate-to-marked basophilia included eosinophilic lung disease (p &lt; 0.0001), leukemia/myeloproliferative neoplasms (p = 0.004), parasitic infection (p = 0.004), mast cell tumor (p = 0.005), and inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.02). Overall, dogs with marked basophilia had a lower frequency of inflammatory diseases (51% vs. 70%, p = 0.009) and a higher frequency of neoplastic diseases (48% vs. 26%, p = 0.003) compared to those with moderate basophilia. In the basophilia group, concurrent eosinophilia was only seen in 36% of dogs. Dogs with concurrent eosinophilia were more often diagnosed with inflammatory diseases (77% vs. 58%, p = 0.006), with fewer diagnoses of neoplasia (19% vs. 40%, p = 0.001), compared to dogs without concurrent eosinophilia. The findings of this study offer veterinary clinicians valuable guidance in determining diagnostic priorities for dogs with moderate-to-marked basophilia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

H. illucens and T. molitor larvae meal are considered high-protein sources for poultry, also presenting considerable amounts of fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. However, other potential components in insect meal and insect oil have been more extensively studied in recent years. Chitin, lauric acid, and antimicrobial peptides can present antimicrobial and prebiotic functions, indicating that low levels of their inclusion in insect meal can beneficially affect broilers' health and immune responses. This systematic review was developed to study the impact of insect products on the health parameters of broilers, and a metanalysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on performance. A database was obtained based on a selection of manuscripts from January 2016 to January 2023, following the mentioned parameters. Both H. illucens and T. molitor meal or oil products had positive effects on poultry health status, especially on the ileal and cecal microbiota population, immune responses, and antimicrobial properties. The average daily gain was greater in broilers fed T. molitor meal compared to H. illucens meal (p = 0.002). The results suggest that low levels of insect meal are suitable for broilers, without resulting in negative effects on body weight gain and the feed conversion ratio, while the insect oil can totally replace soybean oil without negative impacts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133253</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Chemical Profile of Essential Oils of Selected Lamiaceae Plants and In Vitro Activity for Varroosis Control in Honeybees (Apis mellifera).</Title>	<Abstract>The most significant ectoparasitic mite of honeybees, Varroa destructor, has a detrimental effect on bee health and honey output. The principal strategy used by the control programs is the application of synthetic acaricides. All of this has resulted in drug resistance, which is now a major worry for beekeeping. As a result, research on alternate products and techniques for mite management is now required. The aim of this study was to determine whether essential oils (EOs) extracted from botanical species of Lamiacae, typical of the Calabria region of Southern Italy, could reduce the population of the mite V. destructor. Among the best-known genera of the Lamiaceae family are oregano, rosemary and thyme, whose EOs were employed in this study. By steam distillation, the EOs were extracted from Origanum vulgare subsp. viridulum (Martrin-Donos) Nyman, Thymus capitatus Hoffmanns. and Link, Thymus longicaulis C.Presl and Salvia rosmarinus Schleid. plant species harvested directly on the Calabrian territory in their balsamic time. Each EO went to the test in vitro (contact toxicity) against V. destructor. Fifty adult female mites, five for each EO and the positive and negative control, were used in each experimental replicate. The positive controls comprised five individuals treated to Amitraz dilute in acetone, and the negative controls included five individuals exposed to acetone alone. To create the working solution to be tested (50 &#956;L/tube), the EOs were diluted (0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL) in HPLC-grade acetone. After 1 h of exposure, mite mortality was manually assessed. Origanum vulgare subsp. viridulum, Thymus capitatus and Thymus longicaulis were the EOs with the highest levels of efficiency at 2 mg/mL, neutralizing (dead + inactivated), 94%, 92% and 94% of parasites, respectively. Salvia rosmarinus EO gave a lower efficacy, resulting in a percentage of 38%. Interestingly, no adverse effects were highlighted in toxicity tests on honeybees. These results show that these OEs of the Lamiaceae family have antiparasitic action on V. destructor. Therefore, they could be used, individually or combined, to exploit the synergistic effect for a more sustainable control of this parasite mite in honeybee farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to identify risk loci predisposing this breed to the disease. The average age of lymphoma diagnosis in 55 cases was less than 6 years, similar to the median age of 64 cases from our clinical and pathology databases. When fine-scale population structure was explored using NETVIEW, cases were distributed throughout an extended pedigree. When genotyped cases (n = 49) and dogs from the control group (n = 281) were compared in a genome-wide association analysis of lymphoma risk, the most prominent associated regions were detected on CFA13 and CFA33. The top SNPs in a 5.4 Mb region on CFA13 were significant at a chromosome-wide level, and the region was fine-mapped to ~1.2 Mb (CFA13: 25.2-26.4 Mb; CanFam3.1) with four potential functional candidates, including the MYC proto-oncogene bHLH transcription factor (MYC) and a region syntenic with the human and mouse lncRNA Pvt1 oncogene (PVT1). A 380 Kb associated region at CFA33: 7.7-8.1 Mb contained the coding sequence for SUMO specific peptidase7 (SENP7) and NFK inhibitor zeta (NFKBIZ) genes. These genes have annotations related to cancer, amongst others, and both have functional links to MYC regulation. Genomic signatures identified in lymphoma cases suggest that increased risk contributed by the regions identified by GWAS may complement a complex predisposing genetic background.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Volume-rendering computed tomography angiography images were acquired from the ventral aspect using RadiAnt, Amira and OsiriX MD Dicom three-dimensional formats, and three-dimensional printing was obtained and compared with the corresponding computed tomography angiography images. Non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography was made using the time-of-flight imaging in ventral, oblique and lateral views. In addition, three cadavers with colored latex injection were dissected to facilitate the identification of the vascular structures. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography showed the main vascular structures, whereas with the time-of-flight blood appeared with a high signal intensity compared with associated abdominal and pelvic tissues. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography images and time-of-flight sequences provided adequate anatomical details of the main arteries and veins that could be used for future feline anatomical and clinical vascular studies of the abdomen and pelvis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38133256</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Computed Tomographic Findings Secondary to Dental Pathologies: Comparison between Rabbits and Guinea Pigs.</Title>	<Abstract>(1) Background: dental pathologies are the most frequent reason for requesting a CT scan of the head in rabbits and guinea pigs. The study aimed to review head CT exams of both species to identify and characterize lesions secondary to dental disease. (2) Methods: head CT studies of 48 rabbits and 52 guinea pigs with dental pathologies were reviewed. (3) Results: dental abnormalities of mandibular teeth were the most represented, both in rabbits (81.2%) and guinea pigs (98%). The aggressive bone lesion associated with teeth was the more frequently observed bone lesion in rabbits' mandible and maxilla; in guinea pigs, the more frequent bone lesions were bulging around the roots of the teeth with focal lysis in the maxilla, and without focal lysis in the mandible. In the maxilla, the increased attenuation of nasal cavities (rhinitis) was the most frequently observed abnormality both in rabbits (60%) and guinea pigs (83.3%); the exophthalmos was more represented in rabbits (53.3%). In the mandible, the cavernous space-occupying lesion was more represented both in rabbits (92.3%) and guinea pigs (73.3%). (4) Conclusions: lesions secondary to dental pathologies were often observed both in rabbits and guinea pigs; CT examination has proven to be valuable in detecting secondary alterations in both species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In our study, we investigated the efficacy of three feed supplements containing different additives, namely, probiotics (Lactobacillus spp., "Test substance A"), turmeric (Curcuma longa L., "Test substance B"), and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum, "Test substance C"). In the experiment, we tested 180 birds of the B&#225;bolna Tetra-SL laying hybrid breed that were infected with Salmonella enteritidis strains. The birds were randomly divided into six groups: three groups treated with the different additives, a negative control group, a positive control group, and an antibiotic-treated group using enrofloxacin. We examined the maturation and the time course of shedding of Salmonella; at the end of rearing, pathological and histopathological examinations were performed. When Salmonella was isolated from the cloacal swab samples, the enrofloxacin-treated group had a high number of animals shedding Salmonella by day 9, which was like the group treated with test material C. The greatest reduction in Salmonella shedding was observed in the groups treated with test materials A and B. In terms of pathological parameters, villus length and crypt depth were significantly better in the group treated with test material C compared to the positive and negative controls, and when comparing the body weight of the tested animals, the group treated with test material B had a significantly larger absorption surface area compared to the positive control group. Overall, the supplement with test material C proved to be the most effective. In the future, it is worthwhile to investigate the combination of the tested active substances for their possible synergistic effects and to perform a dose-response study to select the optimal dosage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In vitro studies have consistently identified ACS as a promising therapy for OA joints, contributing to its growing popularity in OA treatment. Despite this, there is a noticeable absence of systematic reviews focused solely on the clinical data of OA patients treated with ACS, excluding the in vitro perspective. This study aims to address this gap by systematically reviewing the latest literature, concentrating solely on clinical data in in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy of ACS in OA lesions. All clinical studies involving ACS treatments for horses with OA were included in the assessment. Surprisingly, only six trials met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The results indicate that the majority of the considered articles support the use of ACS as a treatment for horses, albeit with a control group provided in only one study. However, the absence of a control group and the exclusion of histological evaluation diminish the validity of the majority of clinical research. While several studies suggest a beneficial effect of ACS on OA horses without significant adverse effects, this systematic review affirms that there is no definitive evidence for its effectiveness. Therefore, further investigation of the efficacy of ACS products as a treatment for OA is warranted, emphasizing the need for more controlled trials. Poorly designed and biased studies, lacking blinding or control and adopting inadequate outcome measures, may favor positive results and, thus, necessitate a more rigorous approach to validate the efficacy of ACS in OA treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
