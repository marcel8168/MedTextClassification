This study started on September 1(st) and planned to study the effects of different lighting regimes and melatonin treatment on the receptivity and performance of 78 (60-does and 18-bucks) New Zealand White rabbits, which were reared in a private Rabbitary in Menuofia Governorate, Egypt. These rabbits were randomly assigned to six treatment groups of 10 does and three bucks for each (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hours light (HL) and melatonin- treated). Ejaculate traits, sexual activity of bucks, sexual receptivity and reproductive performance of does were recorded. Results revealed that exposure of rabbits to long photoperiods (14 and 16HL) or treatment with melatonin improved the quantity and quality of ejaculate traits and buck sexual activity. Moreover, does sexual receptivity, feed intake, litter size and weight at birth and weaning were increased by long photoperiods (14 and 16HL) or treatment with melatonin. On the other hand, gestation period and pre-weaning mortality rate were decreased. It can be concluded that application of long photoperiods is beneficial to rabbit producers and 14HL:10 hours dark is optimal for satisfying the biological requirements of the rabbits. Finally, the light schedules can be used for biostimulation instead of melatonin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The data pertain to 339 indigenous cattle of different categories. The physical characteristics included colour pattern of body coat, muzzle, tail switch, hoof and horn. Body length, height at wither, heart girth, pouch girth, length of tail, switch, neck, ear and head were taken up for morphometric characterization. The main body coat colour of indigenous cattle was brown (31.18%) followed by white (28.53%), fawn (15.29%), grey (13.53%), black (4.41%) and mixed (7.06%). The prominent colour of tail switch was black (74.53%). Most of animals had black muzzle (86.47%), black hooves (84.71%) and black horn (100%). Morphometric characteristics data obtained were classified according to location, age group and sex of the animal. The means for body length, height at wither, heart girth, pouch girth, length of tail, switch, neck, ear and head were 83.668&#177;0.590, 91.942&#177;0.55, 113.146&#177;0.738, 121.181&#177;0.761, 54.196&#177;0.527, 26.098&#177;0.186, 32.705&#177;0.166, 18.131&#177;0.111 and 35.035&#177;0.195 cm, respectively. Age and sex had significant effect on all the morphometric characters however, location effect was non-significant. The indigenous cattle of Assam are comparatively smaller in size than most of the recognized breeds of cattle however coat colour showed sizeable variation. The data generated for indigenous cattle of Assam would be useful to characterize them.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Oral administration of 0.8 mg/kg body weight (bw) (1/50 LD50) chlorpyrifos (Radar(&#174;)), produced mild diarrhea and gross lesions comprised of paleness, flaccid consistency and slightly enlargement of liver. Histopathologically, chlorpyrifos produced degenerative changes in various organs. Oral administration of 100 mg/kg bw vitamin C partially ameliorated the degenerative changes in kidney and heart. There was insignificant alteration in biochemical and haematological profiles. It is concluded that supplementation of vitamin C reduced the severity of lesions induced by chronic chlorpyrifos toxicity in broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For example, they are significantly present in higher concentration in she-camel's milk than in cattle or buffalo and they are more heat-resistant than their counterparts in cattle and buffalo. Spoilage bacteria are known to communicate with each other by release of signaling molecules, a phenomenon described as quorum sensing (QS). Some food matrices inhibit these signaling compounds. In this study we screened QS inhibitory activities in raw milk of cattle and camel. Ten samples each of fresh raw cow's milk and she-camel's milk from apparently healthy animals were screened using the bacterial model Cromobacterium violaceum. The tested cow's raw milk samples were able to inhibit the production of QS signalling molecules acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by C. violaceum. However, she-camel's milk samples were less effective in inhibiting such AHLs. Thus, one of the factors which influence the inhibitory activity could be derived from variation in milk chemical composition, especially in the percentage of fat which is significantly higher in tested cow's milk samples (2.22&#177;0.12) than in tested she-camel's milk samples (1.44&#177;0.35). Natural inhibition of QS signaling by cow's milk may offer a unique means to control foodborne pathogens and reduce microbial spoilage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 17 bacterial species with 77 strains were successfully isolated and assigned to 21 antibiotics and 4 types of heavy metal (Hg(2+), Cr(6+), Cd(2+), Cu(2+)). Results revealed that bacteria were resistant against lincomycin (92%), oleandomycin (72.7%) and furazolidone (71.4%) while being susceptible to chloramphenicol and florfenicol at 97.4%. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index for C. freundii, E. coli and M. morganii was high with the value up to 0.71. Bacterial strains were found to exhibit 100 % resistance to chromium and mercury. High correlation of resistance against both antibiotics and heavy metals was found (71.4 to 100%) between bullfrog bacteria isolates, except bacteria that were resistant to kanamycin showed only 25% resistance against Cu(2+). Based on the results in this study, bacterial pathogens of bullfrog culture in Johore, Malaysia, were highly resistant to both antibiotics and heavy metals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Rotavirus has segmented genome composed of 11 segments of double stranded RNA. The virus has a triple layered protein shell consisting of a core, an inner capsid and an outer capsid. The inner capsid protein is responsible for group specificity and based on it rotaviruses are classified into seven groups. Ovine rotavirus strains have only been identified into two serogroups (A and B). The two outer capsid proteins (VP7 and VP4) are responsible for G and P typing of rotavirus, respectively. Although rotavirus has been frequently reported in many animal species, data regarding ovine rotavirus strains is very scanty and limited. Only a few ovine rotaviruses have been isolated and characterized so far. Recently, the G and P types circulating in ovines have been identified. The ovine rotavirus strain NT isolated from a diarrheic lamb in China is being considered as a promising vaccine candidate for human infants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 100 cows were randomly divided into three groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were artificially inseminated at 48-50 h (n=30), 53-55 h (n=30) and 58-60 h (n=40) after CIDR removal, respectively. Estrus synchronization was carried out using a CIDR containing 1.38 mg progesterone. All cows were given 2 mg estradiol benzoate, intramuscularly on the day of CIDR insertion (D 0). The CIDR was removed after 8 days and 125 &#956;g of prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF2&#945;) was injected intramuscularly. One day after CIDR removal all cows were given 1 mg of estradiol benzoate intramuscularly (D 9). Cows were observed visually for estrus after removal of CIDR. Between 30 and 32 days after timed AI, pregnancy was determined using transrectal ultrasonography. The first estrus observation which is approximately 32 h after CIDR removal showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) among the three groups. The onset response of estrus after 32 h removal of CIDR was less than 10% in all three groups 6.6% (G1), 6.8% (G2) and 7.3% (G3). Furthermore, percentages of estrus response (D 10) following CIDR removal were 76.6%, 75.0% and 77.5%. The difference between on D 9 and D 10 estrus response were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05).

A total of 208 free range male rhesus macaques captured from different locations in Shivalik Hills in a population control programme of the rhesus macaques in India. General anaesthesia was achieved by using a combination of ketamine hydrochloride at 8 mg/kg body weight and xylazine hydrochloride at 2mg/kg body weight intramuscularly in squeeze cage. Surgical procedure of vasectomy was carried out by single-hole no-scalpel technique using a single pre-scrotal skin incision above the median raphae. Spermatic cord was grasped with ringed forceps and was pulled out through the single-hole incision. Vas deferens was separated from the artery-vein complexus and about 3-4 cm portion of vas deferens was resected. Cauterization of both ends of the vas deferens was achieved with electrocautery. The induction time for anaesthesia was 1.40&#177;0.18 min while surgical time for vasectomy was found to be 5.09&#177;0.22 min. Recovery from general anaesthesia was without side-effects after a mean duration of 36.07&#177;1.22 min, whereas the duration of anaesthesia was observed to be 82.27&#177;4.96 min. There were no major complications following the surgery and recovery of animals was smooth. Animals were kept in postoperative care for five days and released at the same capturing site.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It was determined that ocular dermoids in cross-bred calves are genetically-transmitted defects. Calves typically were affected unilaterally or bilaterally with multiple, connected ocular growths that clinically and histologically mimicked normal haired skin. Sites most commonly involved included ventro-lateral limbus, third eyelid, medial canthus, eyelid and conjunctiva. Centro-corneal and anterior segmental dermoids were also observed. It is postulated from this study that bilateral ocular dermoids are genetically-transmitted defects in Hereford cattle. Characteristics of both autosomal recessive and polygenic inheritance were observed. However, mode of inheritance and role of environment in the pathogenesis of these peculiar and important developmental defects remain undefined. Extensive breeding trials utilizing superovulation, embryo transfer, and pre-terminal caesarean section as well as further field studies might be mandatory to confirm sex incidence, significance of associated somatic defects, role of environment in phenotypic expression, and mode of transmission of ocular dermoids in cross-bred calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several tests, including blood and image analysis, microbiological culture and cytology of lytic areas of affected bone were made in order to establish a diagnosis. Serum biochemical profile revealed increased levels of liver enzymes, plasma globulin, creatine kinase (CK) and calcium. Hemogram revealed anemia and leukocytosis; left humerus image analysis revealed an osteolytic lesion and cytology revealed a suppurative periostitis. Differential diagnosis was a nonspecific infectious inflammatory process or osteosarcoma. Since it was not possible to achieve a definitive diagnosis and there was a highly suspicious for an infectious agent, an agarose cell block of the bone marrow fine-needle aspiration was made. The cytological examination of cell block presented similar findings as described previously. However, additional stains including periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) were positive for fungal hyphae, which rendered a diagnosis of fungal osteomyelitis due to Aspergillus spp. This case report illustrates an uncommon cause of osteomyelitis for breed that was diagnosed by an underused method in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Seven-month-old she-camel calf, with a history of excessive salivation and inability to chew and swallow hay, was referred to Al Qattara veterinary hospital. Solid food was regurgitated, whereas milk and water could be swallowed. On examination; the animal could not protrude its tongue which was attached by a thin tissue band between the ventral surface of the tongue and the floor of the oral cavity. The tissue band was corrected by frenuloplasty and the incisions were sutured. The animal recovered well as the salivation and regurgitation stopped and the animal became able to chew and swallow solid food including hay. It was concluded that ankyloglossia can occur in one-humped camel in which a horizontal to vertical frenuloplasty may improve full function of tongue movement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recent findings on BoHV-5 association with genital disease.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5) belongs to the family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Varicellovirus. This virus is a major causative agent of non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in young cattle. It was first isolated in 1962 from a neurological disease outbreak in Australia. BoHV-5 is genetically and antigenically related to bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), a highly prevalent virus responsible for respiratory and genital disease in cattle. Initially, BoHV-5 was considered a subtype of BoHV-1 (BoHV-1.3). However, the exclusive presentation of outbreaks of neurological disease suggested that the virus was a new agent with characteristics of neuropathogenicity. Even though both are neurotropic viruses, only BoHV-5 is capable of replicating extensively in the central nervous system and inducing neurological disease. Occasionally, encephalitis caused by BoHV-1 has been reported. Like other alpha-herpesviruses, BoHV-5 can establish latency in nervous ganglia and, by stress factors or glucocorticoid treatment, latent virus can be reactivated. During episodes of reactivation, the virus is excreted in nasal, ocular and genital secretions and transmitted to other susceptible hosts. Recently, BoHV-5 has been associated with infection of the reproductive tract. The virus has been isolated and the presence of viral DNA has been demonstrated in semen samples from Brazil and Australia and natural transmission of the virus through contaminated semen has also been described. Embryos and oocytes are permissive for BoHV-5 infection and BoHV-5 DNA has been detected in the central nervous system of aborted fetuses. The objective of this review is to compile the limited information on the recent association between BoHV-5 and reproductive disorders in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Straw is constant component of ruminant diets on small holder farms; however, there is little information about its nutritive value. Accordingly experiment was conducted to determine the chemical composition and ruminal organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) degradability of chickpea straw using nylon bags (in situ) technique. Replicated samples were incubated at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours in three rumen canulated Ghezel rams with 50&#177;3 kg body weight. Dry matter (DM), CP, ether extract (EE), OM, crude fiber (CF) and nitrogen free extract (NFE) content of chickpea straws were 92.2, 6.1, 5.5, 92.0, 34.3 and 46.2%, respectively. The soluble fraction (a) of the OM and CP of chickpea straw was 17.5 and 40.8% and potential degradability (a+b) of OM and CP was 56.7 and 72.0%, respectively. Effective degradability at different passage rates (2, 5 and 8% per hours) for OM was 51.0 44.9 and 40.7% and for CP were 68.4, 64.3 and 61.3%, respectively.

<Rec><Common><PMID>26623293</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Cytokine expression in malaria-infected non-human primate placentas.</Title>	<Abstract>Malaria parasites are known to mediate the induction of inflammatory immune responses at the maternal-foetal interface during placental malaria (PM) leading to adverse consequences like pre-term deliveries and abortions. Immunological events that take place within the malaria-infected placental micro-environment leading to retarded foetal growth and disruption of pregnancies are among the critical parameters that are still in need of further elucidation. The establishment of more animal models for studying placental malaria can provide novel ways of circumventing problems experienced during placental malaria research in humans such as inaccurate estimation of gestational ages. Using the newly established olive baboon (Papio anubis)-Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi) H strain model of placental malaria, experiments were carried out to determine placental cytokine profiles underlying the immunopathogenesis of placental malaria. Four pregnant olive baboons were infected with blood stage P. knowlesi H strain parasites on the one fiftieth day of gestation while four other uninfected pregnant olive baboons were maintained as uninfected controls. After nine days of infection, placentas were extracted from all the eight baboons through cesarean surgery and used for the processing of placental plasma and sera samples for cytokine sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results indicated that the occurrence of placental malaria was associated with elevated concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin 12 (IL-12). Increased levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 and interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) levels were detected in uninfected placentas. These findings match previous reports regarding immunity during PM thereby demonstrating the reliability of the olive baboon-P. knowlesi model for use in further studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood samples were collected from 4 dairy cattle at 3 weeks before the expected parturition (wk -3), parturition (wk 0) and 3 weeks after parturition (wk +3). The DNA damage of PBMC and PMN was evaluated based on the comet assay using visual scoring (arbitrary units). Undamaged DNA remained within the core (score 0) and the broken DNA migrated from the core towards the anode forming the tail of a comet (scores 1-4). Significantly higher scores in PBMC at wk 0 and wk +3 were observed compared with those in PMN although there were no significant changes of scores in either cell type during the experimental period. It is suggested that the apoptotic rate of PBMC is accelerated compared with that of PMC during the transition period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On examination it was found that the calf had no tail, the posterior sacral margin was blunt and the anal opening was absent. The case was diagnosed as congenital anury with atresia ani. The animal was sedated with 0.1 mg/kg of xylazine administered intramuscularly and under local infiltration with 2% lidocaine a circular incision was made at the anal area to create an anal opening. The animal passed plenty of meconium. The cut edges were sutured with horizontal mattress sutures. The animal was administered penicillin and streptomycin for 5 days and had an uneventful recovery. It is reported that congenital anury rarely occurs in one humped camel and accompanied atresia ani can be surgically treated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Single dose of each plant extract (1 ml / 30 ml buffered rumen fluid) and two sorghum fodder containing diets (high and low fiber diets) were used for evaluating the effect on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation pattern, while sequential incubations (0, 1, 2, 3, 6 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 96 h) were carried out for gas production kinetics. Results showed that methane production was reduced, ammonia nitrogen was increased significantly, while no significant effect was found on pH and protozoal population following addition of different plant extracts in both diets except mehandi. Green chili significantly reduced digestibility of dry matter, total fatty acid and acetate concentration at incubation with sorghum based high and low fiber diets. Among all treatments, green chili increased potential gas production, while jaiphal decreased the gas production rate constant significantly. The present results demonstrate that methanolic extracts of different plants are promising rumen modifying agents. They have the potential to modulate the methane production, potential gas production, gas production rate constant, dry matter digestibility and microbial biomass synthesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Body temperature was recorded in degrees Celsius, animal weight in kilograms, serum proteins in g/dl using a refractometer, haematocrit percentage by capillary centrifugation and the anti-T. evansi IgG titer by indirect ELISA immunoassay, from both infected animals and controls for 95 days. Infected animals showed a higher body temperature, total serum protein and anti- T. evansi antibody titer, and a lower haematocrit and weight gain than controls. These differences were related to the presence of the parasites in the blood as detected micro-haematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and direct microscopic examination (DME). This study confirms the usefulness of rabbits as a model for the study of trypanosomosis; the clinical features of the disease can be observed and the three characteristic stages, prepatent period, acute and chronic phase clearly defined over the course of the infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Crude protein (CP) concentration varied from 6.76% for almond tree to 2.76% for cherry tree, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), from 29.2, 20.8% for apricot tree to 20.8 and 15.8% for almond tree leaves respectively. Polyphenol and tannin composition measured from 3.49, 1.2% for almond tree to 1.51 and 0.61% for apricot tree, respectively. In situ rumen degradability was carried out in three fistulaed Taleshi native male cattle which were incubated at times of 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96-hour. Almond leaves had higher potential degradation (a+b) for dry matter (92.37%) and cherry leaves showed lower potential degradation (84.12%), respectively. Effective rumen degradable dry matter at rate of 0.05/h varied from 69.86% for almond tree to 52.20% for cherry leaves. Results showed that the almond leaves were higher in nutritive value than cherry and apricot leaves. Therefore, almond tree leaves could be used with forage in ruminant diets to reduce cost of animals feed requirements. Overall, it seemed that the tree leaves used in this study, had a higher nutritive value in ruminant's nutrition, however more experiments are needed for an accurate determination of nutritional values of these resources.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26623299</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Nutritional value of raw soybeans, extruded soybeans, roasted soybeans and tallow as fat sources in early lactating dairy cows.</Title>	<Abstract>Thirty multiparous Holstein cows (29.8 &#177; 4.01days in milk; 671.6 &#177; 31.47 kg of body weight) were used in a completely randomized design to compare nutritional value of four fat sources including tallow, raw soybeans, extruded soybeans and roasted soybeans for 8 weeks. Experimental diets were a control containing 27.4 % alfalfa silage, 22.5% corn silage, and 50.1% concentrate, and four diets with either tallow, raw soybean, extruded soybean, or roasted soybean added to provide 1.93% supplemental fat. Dry matter and NEL intakes were similar among treatments, while cows fed fat diets had significantly (P&lt;0.05) high NEL intakes when compared to control with no fat. Supplemental fat, whether tallow or full fat soybeans increased milk production (1.89-2.45 kg/d; P&lt;0.01) and FCM production (1.05-2.79; P&lt;0.01). Milk fat yield and percentage of cows fed fat-supplemented diets were significantly (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05 respectively) higher than control. Between fat-supplemented diets, roasted soybean caused highest milk fat yield and extruded soybean caused lowest milk fat yield. There was no significant effect of supplemental fat on the milk protein and lactose content and yield. Feed efficiency of fat-supplemented diets was significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher than control. Body weight, body weight change and BCS (body condition score) of cows, as well as energy balance and energy efficiency were similar between treatments. In conclusion, while there was no significant effect of fat sources on production response of cows, fat originating from heat-treated soybean help to minimize imported RUP (rumen undegradable protein) sources level as fish meal in comparison with tallow and raw soybean oil. In the Current study, there was no statistical significance among nutritional values of oil from extruded soybeans and roasted soybeans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A number of trypanosome species are implicated in these diseases, but it is the Trypanosoma brucei group that is responsible for the chronic form of sleeping sickness. During the course of this chronic infection the parasite shows a clear tropism for organs and tissues and only sporadically appears in the blood stream. Notwithstanding this feature, tsetse flies normally get infected from chronically infected apparasitemic hosts. For some pathogens like the microfilaria, it has already shown that the saliva of the vector, black fly saliva contribute to orient the pathogen to the site of the vector bite. Chemotaxis of tsetse saliva may perhaps stimulate movement of Trypanosoma brucei parasites from tissues to the bloodstream and via the vascular to the tsetse feeding site, and could explain the relatively high infection rate of tsetse flies feeding on chronically infected animals. This review paper looks into the possible role of trypanosome-vector saliva in ensuring parasite acquisition and its application in the tsetse - trypanosome interaction at the host skin interphase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The incision was closed with one interrupted, horizontal mattress suture using USP-2 chromic catgut. In 14/165 animals (8.5%) postoperative infection (sepsis) developed, which healed in two to three weeks after open wound management. The remaining 151 animals had an uneventful recovery, but a slight edematous swelling of the scrotum was observed in 8 of the 151 animals (5.3%), which was self-limiting and of no significance. No primary or secondary postoperative bleeding was noticed in any of the animals. It was concluded that this technique was less time consuming with negligible postoperative care and complications when performed under standard surgical principles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Malayan gaur is mainly distributed in the tropical woodlands of Peninsular Malaysia and Southern Thailand. The aim of this study was to collect, analyze and cryopreserve the semen of wild Malayan gaur. Transrectal massage (TM) and electroejaculation (EEJ) technique was applied in semen collection of the Malayan gaur. The semen was then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using slow freezing technique. Makler counting chamber was used to evaluate sperm concentration and motility, while the sperm viability and morphology of fresh and post-thaw sperm was determined using eosin-nigrosin staining protocol. As a result, we have successfully collected the Malayan gaur semen using EEJ technique. Sperm motility, viability and morphological changes of the post-thaw semen of Malayan gaur were found undesirable due to the complication of the cryopreservation process. On the basis of current study it can be concluded that Malayan gaur bulls semen can be obtain by EEJ with no evidence of rectal trauma. Optimization of the process of cryopreservation for Malayan gaur sperm is needed to maintain the cryoviability of the good sperm quality. The data generated in this study would be useful in conservation of genetic diversity program for Malayan gaur.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten clinically healthy sheep were used in this study. A total number of 30 blood samples, were divided into three different groups, and were stored in a refrigerator adjusted to +4 &#186;C (Group I, n = 10), at RT of about 22-25 &#186;C (Group II, n = 10) and in an incubator adjusted to 37 &#186;C (Group III, n = 10) for up to 48 h. Blood samples were analysed for blood gas and acid-base indices at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of storage. In comparison to the baseline value (0), there were significant decreases of blood pH of samples stored at RT and in the incubator after 1 h (p&lt;0.05), the pH value of refrigerated blood samples exhibited insignificant changes during the study (p&lt;0.05). Mean values of pCO2 showed a significant increase in Group I and Group III after 1 h then a progressive decrease after 12 h in all Groups. Mean pO2 values were significantly higher for Group I after 2 h and for Groups II and III after 1 h (p&lt;0.05). In general, base excess decreased significantly for all the groups during the study especially in Groups II and III. In comparison with baseline values, in all groups, bicarbonate (HCO3) increased between 1 h and 6 h (p&lt;0.05), and later decreased at the end of the study (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, status of acid-base indices of the samples stored at refrigerator and RT were found within normal reference range and it may be of clinical diagnostic use for up to 6 h.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty animals (32 goats and 18 sheep) with different ocular problems were examined. Ultrasonographic examination was performed using a B-mode ocular ultrasound unit, and the structure of the globe was evaluated at a depth of 4-6 cm. Early cases (n=35, 70%) showed varying ocular conditions; hypopyon, (n=8, 16%), stromal abscesses, (n=4, 8%), and anterior uveitis (n=23, 46%). Hypopyon appeared clinically as a white or yellowish material in the anterior chamber, and ultrasonographically as a hyperechoic mass in the anterior chamber. Severe iridocyclitis was noticed in acute cases of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) accompanied by blepharospasm, photophobia, excessive tearing and eyelid margin crust formation. Ultrasonographically, the pupil appeared constricted with increased hyperechoic thickening of the ciliary body. In chronic cases of IKC, corneal pigmentation (n=5, 10%) and cataract (n=10, 20%) were seen. Ultrasonographically the type and degree of cataract were diagnosed. The present study provides an inside view of the inner ocular structures during the course of certain eye diseases where ophthalmoscopic examination is not possible. Our findings, although preliminary, are relevant for the more complete diagnosis of certain external ocular conditions in sheep and goat herds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fresh ejaculates from three healthy, sexually mature boars were diluted with equal volumes of six short-term or three long-term commercial extenders and stored at 19&#176;C for 6 days (short-term) or 12 days (long-term). The integrity of spermatozoa membranes was analyzed by FMS using propidium iodide, 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3' tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA). The results obtained from this staining were compared with spermatozoa motility assessed by CASA. Our study showed that the number of viable spermatozoa with non-reacted acrosomes and intact mitochondria was positively correlated with the rate of motile spermatozoa (r(2)&gt;0.9) irrespective of the extender used. In all extenders the number of motile spermatozoa significantly decreased as preservation period increased (P&lt;0.05). FMS test is a potent indicator of sperm motility because it analyses mitochondrial integrity independently from observable alterations in motility. The best performing extenders were BTS for short-term storage and TRI-x-Cell for long-term storage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26623309</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Histopathological changes induced by paraquat on some tissues of gourami fish (Trichogaster trichopterus).</Title>	<Abstract>Paraquat is a contact and non-selective herbicide which is used for controlling a wide range of terrestrial weeds and aquatic plants. A long-term contact with this xenobiotic can potentially lead to injuries in fishes as live non-target organisms. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of sub-lethal toxicity of paraquat on the pathology of gill, liver, and spleen tissues in gourami fish (Trichogaster trichopterus). In this study, sub-lethal concentration is determined based on lethal concentration (LC50 : 7.16&#177;0.69, 4.46&#177;0.43, 2.19&#177;0.27 and 1.41&#177;0.17 mg/l of paraquat within 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, respectively). The experiment was done with four varied concentrations of paraquat (0.0, 0.07, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/l equal 0.0%, 5%, 10% and 20% of nominal value of 96 h LC50) during 3 weeks. The exposed fish displayed erratic swimming and became lethargic. The changes in gills were characterized by hypertrophy, epithelial, epithelium increase of gill filament, edema and secondary gill lamella. The liver showed hypotrophy of liver cells, cloudy swelling and formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in the liver tissue of fish treated with 0.15 and 0.3 mg/l concentrations of paraquat. Disorder in the ellipsoid cell and hemosiderin accumulation in melano-macrophage centers was observed in the spleen tissue of fish exposed to 0.15 and 0.3 mg/l of paraquat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26623310</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Efficacy of a combined protocol for re-insemination of open cows after early pregnancy diagnosis using ultrasonography and its effect on fertility.</Title>	<Abstract>The objective of the present field study was to establish the beneficial effects of re-insemination of non-pregnant cows using ultrasonography 20 to 23 days after the artificial insemination. A total of 245 Japanese Black cows were artificially inseminated and early pregnancy diagnosis (EPD) was performed on 92 cows 20 days after insemination, using ultrasonography. The remaining 153 cows were considered as negative controls in which routine rectal palpation was performed for pregnancy diagnosis 45-50 days post-insemination. EPD revealed that eleven of the 92 cows (12%) were infertile due to ovarian abnormalities and were thus excluded from the rest of the study. Forty-eight (59%) of the remaining 81 cows were diagnosed as pregnant, while the other 33 (41%) were diagnosed as non-pregnant. Of these non-pregnant cows, 17 of them received a dose of an analogue of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH analogue) and were then timed-inseminated, while the other 16 were observed for estrus signs, and 13 of them (81%) were artificially inseminated. Rates of conception were 35% and 38% in the GnRH and the artificially inseminated groups, respectively (P&gt;0.05). Total pregnancy rate for the EPD group increased significantly (74%) (P&lt;0.01) when compared to the control cows (54%) within the same period. In conclusion, our field study demonstrated that re-insemination of non-pregnant cows following EPD is highly efficacious not only in improving the rate of fertility via reducing inter-insemination and inter-calving intervals, but also aids in the early detection of ovarian disorders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For this purpose, oil containing different levels of omega-3, 6, 9 fatty acids were added to semen extender. To emulsify the oil in semen extender, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added as a suitable solvent and the solution was finally sonicated. Five proven Holstein bulls were randomly selected and their ejaculates were collected using an artificial vagina. Groups were designed as control, treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4. The control group contained only the basic extender (Tris-citrate buffer, egg yolk and glycerol) without any additives. In treatment 1, only 5% PEG was added to the diluent; while in treatments 2, 3 and 4 different concentrations of omega-3, 6, 9 fatty acids (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0%) in combination with PEG were added to the basic extender. After dilution, the semen samples were packaged into 0.5 ml straws, a process that was followed by cooling the semen straws. Motility, viability and morphology of semen samples were evaluated after 24 and 48 h of storage in refrigerator (5 &#176;C) or after one month of storage in the liquid nitrogen. Immotility was increased and all the other parameters including motility, viability and morphology were significantly decreased in all the groups compared with fresh samples during cold storage and freezing-thawing. Our results demonstrated the following: 1) PEG has significant detrimental effects, especially on the sperm motility; 2) addition of omega-3, 6, 9 fatty acids could not improve the sperm motility in chilled storage condition and after freezing-thawing; and 3) omega-3, 6, 9 fatty acidscould not also attenuate the other deleterious effects of PEG. In conclusion, our findings reveal that addition of these fatty acids to the semen extender does not enhance the resistance of the bovine sperm membrane to cooling and freezing-thawing and that further studies are required to find suitable candidate compounds that can boost the quality of semen that is chilled and freeze-thawed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The response to three different treatments against APAP poisoning was evaluated. Free glutathione (GSH) (200mg/kg), niosomal GSH (14 mg/kg) and free amino acids (180 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine and 280 mg/kg of methionine) were administered to cats that were intoxicated with APAP (a single dose of 150 mg/kg, p.o.). Serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) along with serum, liver and erythrocyte concentration of GSH and methemoglobin percentage were measured before and 4, 24 and 72 hours after APAP administration. Free GSH (200 mg/kg) and niosomal GSH (14 mg/kg) were effective in reducing hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity in cats intoxicated with a dose of 150 mg/kg APAP. We conclude that both types of treatments can protect the liver and haemoglobin against oxidative stress in APAP intoxicated cats. Furthermore, our results showed that treatment with niosomal GSH represents an effective therapeutic approach for APAP poisoning.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Histopathological examination of the tissue samples removed from 50 tumor-like growths (2 males and 48 females) revealed three types of tumors; squamous cell carcinoma (70%), spiny keratoderma (22%) and fibroma (8%). An increased incidence of tumors was recorded in the medial when compared to the lateral toenails in both sexes. In females, the incidence in the medial toenails was 90/259 (34.75%) and 71/259 (27.41%) in the right and left forelimbs respectively when compared to the lateral toenails which was 25/259 (9.65%) and 5/259 (1.93%) for the respective right and left forelimbs. In the hind limbs, this ratio was 29/259 (11.20%) and 20/259 (7.72%) for right and left medial toenails respectively, whereas it was 17/259 (6.56%) and 2/259 (0.77%) for the right and left lateral toenails respectively. Similar to the observations in female camels, male camels also showed a higher incidence of these tumors in the medial when compared to the lateral toenails in both fore and hind limbs. Based on these findings, we conclude that in the dromedary camels, the medial toenails of the fore limbs are most commonly affected with tumors; with the most common tumor being the squamous cell carcinoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that non-pathogenic protozoa (including Tetrahymena) engulf Salmonella and then exacerbate its virulence in cattle, but the mechanistic details of the phenomenon are not fully understood. GPCRs were investigated since these receptors facilitate phagocytosis of particulates by Tetrahymena, and a GPCR apparently modulates bacterial engulfment for the pathogenic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. A database search identified three putative Tetrahymena GPCRs, based on sequence homologies and predicted transmembrane domains, that were the focus of this study. Salmonella engulfment by Tetrahymena was assessed in the presence of suramin, a non-specific GPCR inhibitor. Salmonella engulfment was also assessed in Tetrahymena in which expression of putative GPCRs was knocked-down using RNAi. A candidate GPCR was then expressed in a heterologous yeast expression system for further characterization. Our results revealed that Tetrahymena were less efficient at engulfing Salmonella in the presence of suramin. Engulfment was reduced concordantly with a reduction in the density of protozoa. RNAi-based studies revealed that knock-down of one the Tetrahymena GPCRs caused diminished engulfment of Salmonella. Tetrahymena lysates activated this receptor in the heterologous expression system. These data demonstrate that the Tetrahymena receptor is a putative GPCR that facilitates bacterial engulfment by Tetrahymena. Activation of the putative GPCR seemed to be related to protozoan cell density, suggesting that its cognate ligand is an intercellular signaling molecule.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Majority (3/7) of the camels was primiparous and all parturitions had a history of calving assistance. Six (6/7) camels recovered by first intention of healing. Dehiscence of perineal structure occurred in only one camel due to infection and healed by second intention. Subsequent matings resulted in pregnancy in four camels and one camel died due to unrelated causes. We conclude that perineal lacerations can occur in primiparous camels with difficult assisted deliveries and that one stage repair of perineal lacerations in camels improves the perineal conformation and such camels may easily regain normal fertility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Acoustic myography, assessing both the amplitude and frequency of active muscles, was employed to locate the specific area of muscle injury, the right hip, which exhibited minimal fibre recruitment giving rise to considerable weakness. This specific region was assessed by accelerometry which revealed a normal step interval for the injured leg when compared with the contralateral, but a weaker acceleration and strike force. Finally, an assessment of muscle resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) using bioimpedance confirmed a regional loss of muscle mass and a loss of cellular integrity compared with the contralateral limb.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Muscle samples of these animals were examined by trichinoscopy. Trichinella larvae were detected only in 4 (5.7%) of the hedgehogs (Erinaceus algirus) and 2 (10.5%) of the red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Larvae were found in the muscles of the diaphragm, abdomen, tongue, forelimb, hindlimb and intercostal muscles. Examination of tissue sections revealed the presence of numerous cysts within the muscle fibers containing one or more coiled or elongated larvae. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed around the cysts especially at their poles. Results indicated the importance of wild animals as reservoirs of Trichinella larvae and their role in the transmission of the disease to other wild and domestic animals as well as humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During the investigation haemoflagellates from the genus Babesiosoma and Trypanosoma were recorded in the blood smears. Trypanosomes were present in all the species except C. carpio, whereas Babesiosoma were only found in T. marmorata. Haematological analysis revealed a significant (p&lt;0.01) reduction in red blood cell count in the fishes infected with Babesiosoma and Trypanosoma. A significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) was recorded in haemoglobin value and packed cell volume in the infected fishes in comparison to the non-infected fishes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty adult male albino mice were used for the study. The mice were divided into six groups of five mice each. Group 1 served as uninfected control, Groups 2 and 3 were infected with H. bakeri and T. brucei respectively, Group 4 received both T. brucei and H. bakeri on the same day, Group 5 was experimentally infected with H. bakeri three days after T. brucei infection, while Group 6 was infected with T. brucei three days after H. bakeri infection. Blood and faecal samples were collected and analyzed weekly to determine the faecal egg counts (FEC), packed cell volume (PCV) and level of parasitaemia (LP). Weekly body weights (BW) were also recorded. FEC and parasitaemia increased in all the infected groups during the study, but these were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in the multiple-infection (groups 4, 5 and 6) than those with the single infection (groups 2 and 3). The same trend was also observed in the BW and PCV (p&lt;0.05). The level of infection produced by single infection with T. brucei and H. bakeri respectively were similar (p&lt;0.05). All treatment groups were significantly (p&lt;0.05) different from the control group. From the results, it was concluded that concurrent helminth and protozoan parasite infections produced more deleterious effect on the host when compared with single infection with either parasite. However, the pathology produced by concurrent infection was more severe when the host was exposed to the protozoan parasite before the helminth parasite.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

All calves were crossbred and intact males. The most noticeable clinical presentations were perineal (n= 10) or prescrotal (n= 2) swellings and micturition problems. The main ultrasonographic findings were oval shaped dilatation of the urethra in all animals with dimensions of 40-75 X 30-62 mm. The calves with perineal urethral dilatation were treated by perineal urethrostomy (n= 4) and partial penile transection including the dilated urethra and urethral fistulation (n= 6). Prescrotal urethral dilatations were treated by penile transection proximal to the dilatation site (n= 2). Cystitis and stricture of the urethra were recorded postoperatively for two of the calves that underwent perineal urethrostomy. Nine animals were slaughtered at normal body weight approximately 6-8 months after the surgical treatment. Three animals were slaughtered after approximately three to four months, two of them having gained insufficient body weight. Our study shows that ultrasonography is a useful tool for the diagnosis of urethral dilatation in bovine calves. Our study also shows that the partial penile transection may be a suitable and satisfactory choice of surgical treatment for correcting the urethral dilatation in bovine calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Nineteen dogs undergoing elbow arthroscopy were included in the study and were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group RT received irrigation fluid at room temperature (RT) while dogs in group W received warmed (W) irrigation fluid (36&#176;C). A standardised patient management and anaesthetic protocol was used and body temperature was measured at four time points; (T1) pre-anaesthetic examination, (T2) arrival into theatre, (T3) end of surgery and (T4) arrival into recovery. There was no significant difference in body temperature at any time point between the groups. The mean overall decrease in body temperature between pre-anaesthetic examination (T1) and return to the recovery suite (T4) was significant in both groups, with a fall of 1.06&#177;0.58&#176;C (p&lt;0.001) in group RT and 1.53&#177;0.76&#176;C (p&lt;0.001) group W. There was no significant difference between the groups. At the end of surgery (T3) 4/19 (21.1%) of dogs were hypothermic (&lt;37&#176;C). The addition of warmed irrigation fluids to a temperature management protocol in dogs undergoing elbow arthroscopy during general anaesthesia did not lead to decreased temperature losses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The animal was living in an open yard of 25 square meters along with three other females. They were given concentrate-rich ration with free access to green leaves and water. Autopsy revealed cardiac enlargement due to left ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular dilatation. The left aterioventricular valves were irregularly thickened and contracted. The lungs were engorged with blood and the liver had nutmeg appearance. The small intestine showed segmental sub-serosal petechial hemorrhages. Histological examination revealed myxomatous degeneration of the left aterioventricular valves, pulmonary congestion and edema, congestion of periacinar hepatic zone and fatty degeneration of outer zones, renal glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. The affected parts of the small intestine showed villous atrophy with lacteal distention. The venules in the affected intestinal segment were severely dilated while the arterioles had narrow lumen and irregular wall thickening with hyaline deposition.

The highest infection rates have been detected in parrots (Psittacidae) and pigeons (Columbiformes), the latter most frequently carry the genotypes B and E. These genotypes have been shown to also infect humans. Because pigeons (Columba livia) cohabit with humans in urban areas, C. psittaci present in the dust from dry feces of infected pigeons may be transmitted by inhalation and represent a significant public health problem. Between 2012 and 2013 a total of 120 fecal samples were collected from pigeons at four public places (Plaza de la Cultura, Parque Moraz&#225;n, Parque Central de Guadalupe, Plaza de las Garant&#237;as Sociales) in San Jos&#233;, Costa Rica. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a region of the outer membrane protein A gene of C. psittaci. Only one sample was positive in PCR and the positive sample was further subjected to sequencing and genotyping. Sequencing identified this sample as C. psittaci genotype B. This study is the first report to show the presence of this organism in pigeons of Costa Rica, and shows that the infected pigeons may represent a significant risk for humans who visit public places that are inhabited by pigeons.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Semen was collected from six healthy and mature rams with an average body weight of 60.0 &#177; 5.0 Kg using an electro ejaculator. High quality samples were mixed and diluted in Tris extender supplemented with different concentrations of vitamin B12 (0, 1, 2 and 3 mg/ml). The semen aliquots were cooled and preserved at 5&#176;C and their qualities were evaluated during pre-freezing and then the cooled semen samples were packaged into 0.25 ml straws. Straws were frozen in the vapor of liquid nitrogen, and were then stored at -196&#186;C. Straws were thawed seven days later and the characteristics of spermatozoa were examined. Results of this study showed that the effect of vitamin B12 on characteristics such as viability, motility, progressive motility and normality of spermatozoa were significant in pre and post freezing conditions (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, for long term storage of semen of Dallagh rams, we recommend using 2 mg/ml of vitamin B12 in semen extender.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Juveniles were exposed to 0.1 mg/L CdCl2 for 31 days. Blood samples were examined using hematological tests and head kidney histology was determined by light microscopy. The concentration of Cd in the head and trunk kidneys was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Cd produced histopathological changes in the head kidney, the most evident of these being: the thickening of the vein wall, an increase in the number of basophils/mast cells close to blood vessels and a severe depletion of hematopoietic precursors especially the granulopoietic series. In the blood, a decrease in the total leucocytes and hemoglobin concentration was observed. Cd-exposed fish showed higher Cd concentrations in the trunk kidney than the head kidney. In conclusion, exposure to Cd affected precursor hematopoietic cells in C. macropomum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood samples were collected from 21 camels (12 males and 9 females). The camels were further divided into two groups: 12 young camels at the age of 3 months to 2 years and 9 adult camels at the age of 3-15 years. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of serum proteins identified five protein fractions in adult camels as young camels, these five protein fractions include albumin, &#945;1 and &#945;2, &#946; and &#947;-globulins. In adult camels, serum levels (g/l) of total protein, albumin, &#945;1-globulins, &#945;2-globulins, &#946;-globulins and &#947;-globulins were 80.9&#177;3.10, 42.9&#177;3.10, 1.3&#177;0.22, 2.2&#177;0.30, 11.8&#177;0.30 and 22.6&#177;0.20, respectively. However, in young camels, these levels (g/l) were 66.8&#177;2.90, 40.2&#177;2.40, 1.0&#177;0.14, 2.6&#177;0.30, 10.6&#177;0.80 and 12.3&#177;1.20, respectively. The albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio was 2.08&#177;0.28 in adult camels and 3.77&#177;0.53 in young ones. The mean serum concentrations of total protein and &#947;-globulins were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher and the A/G ratio was significantly lower in adult camels compared to young camels. The mean concentrations of &#947;-globulins were significantly higher and the A/G ratio was significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower in females compared to male camels. The results of the present study indicate a significant effect of age and sex on the concentrations of some of the serum protein fractions in dromedary camels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These neoplasms are slow growing, locally invasive, and have the potential to compress and invade the brain. A 10-year-old mixed breed dog was presented with a history of approximately 4 months of progressive growth of a left zygomatic mass. Radiographic investigation revealed a finely granular or stippled non homogeneous radiopaque mass involving the zygomatic arch. After surgery, grossly the neoplasm consisted of multiple, variably sized, grayish-white to yellow nodules separated by collagenous septa of different thickness. Histologically, the tumor was characterized by the presence of multiple lobules containing osteoid and cartilage, separated by a net of fibrous septae. This neoplastic pattern was consistent with a typical multilobular tumor of bone and based on clinical, radiographical, gross and light microscopic findings the definitive diagnosis was made. While reviewing veterinary literature only few cases of MTB were found in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Analyses of sperm cell motility using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) indicated that the whey protein Porex has a similar protective effect as bovine serum albumin (BSA) in maintaining viability of stored boar sperm. Boar sperm diluted in TRIXcell+ maintains commercially acceptable motility (&gt;60%) for 10 days, while swine sperm diluted in the semen preservation medium Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) maintains commercially acceptable motility (&gt;60%) for 3-5 days for most boars. To test the on-farm fertility performance of TRIXcell+ compared to BTS, inseminations were started on 35 commercial pig production farms in the summer of 2006. During the period of July 2006 until July 2012 for each farm and each calendar year the mean farrowing rate and litter size for semen diluted in TRIXcell+ and stored for 3-5 days was found higher than that of semen stored for 1-2 days in BTS. Based on data gained from a total of 583.749 sows inseminated through the years 2006-2012, the mean farrowing rate for semen diluted in TRIXcell+ and BTS was 90.4 &#177; 4.0 and 87.9 &#177; 3.6, respectively, which is not significantly different. Based on the same data, the mean total number of piglets born alive for semen diluted in TRIXcell+ and BTS was 14.2 &#177; 0.7 and 13.6 &#177; 0.6, respectively, which is significantly different. We conclude that whey protein can effectively be used in the long-term preservation medium TRIXcell resulting in a higher litter size.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26623336</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Fosfomycin: Uses and potentialities in veterinary medicine.</Title>	<Abstract>Fosfomycin (FOS) is a natural bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic which acts on proliferating bacteria by inhibiting cell wall and early murein/peptidoglycan synthesis. Bactericidal activity is evident against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and can also act synergistically with other antibiotics. Bacterial resistance to FOS may be natural or acquired. Other properties of this drug include inhibition of bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells, exopolysaccharide biofilm penetration, immunomodulatory effect, phagocytosis promotion and protection against the nephrotoxicity caused by other drugs. FOS has chemical characteristics not typically observed in organic phosphoric compounds and its molecular weight is almost the lowest of all the antimicrobials. It tends to form salts easily due to its acidic nature (disodium salt, for intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration; calcium and trometamol salt: for oral (PO) administration). FOS has a very low protein binding (&lt;0.5%) which, along with its low molecular weight and water solubility, contributes to its good diffusion into fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous and vitreous humor, interstitial fluid) and tissues (placenta, bone, muscle, liver, kidney and skin/fat). In all species, important differences in the bioavailability have been found after administration in relation to the various derivatives of FOS salts. Pharmacokinetic profiles have been described in humans, chickens, rabbits, cows, dogs, horses and weaning piglets. The low toxicity and potential efficacy of FOS are the main factors that contribute to its use in humans and animals. Thus, it has been used to treat a broad variety of bacterial infections in humans, such as localized peritonitis, brain abscesses, severe soft tissue infections, cystitis and other conditions. In veterinary medicine, FOS is used to treat infectious diseases of broiler chickens and pigs. In broilers, it is administered for the treatment of E. coli and Salmonella spp. infections. In piglets, the drug is prescribed to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. FOS penetration is demonstrated in phagocytic, respiratory (HEP-2) and intestinal (IPEC-J2) cells. Although not widely used in animals, the drug has shown good results in human medicine. The potentialities of FOS suggest that this drug is a promising candidate for the treatment of infections in veterinary medicine. For these reasons, the aim of this work is to provide animal health practitioners with information on a drug that is not extensively recognized.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture on ulna fracture healing in dogs. In this study, 12 healthy dogs were randomly divided in to four equal groups, where group 1 was kept as control group and evaluated for 45 days, group 2: treatment group and evaluated for 45 days, group3: control group of 90 days and group 4: treatment group of 90 days. After induction of anesthesia, the ulna was cut with Gigli wire saw in each groups, 10 days after operation, the treatment (acupuncture) group was treated with 10 minutes electroacupuncture stimulations on the acupoints Kid1, Kid3, Kid6 and Kid7, for 10 days. Histopathologic samples of all dogs were harvested from bone osteotomized site in 45 and 90 days after surgery. Indices like, count of inflammatory cells, cartilaginous tissue, fibrotic tissue and deposition of collagen were evaluated on samples and classified with 0, 1, 2, and 3 degrees. Also, radiographic evaluation of the patients was applied using radiographic scoring system on days: 7, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 after surgery. This study revealed that, acupuncture had no effect on bone healing (p&gt;0.05). Cause of non-significant difference changes between the control and treatment groups, and lack of complete healing in both groups may be due to lack of ulna bone fixation. Alternatively, selection of other acupoints in acupuncture could have a better healing role.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Retrobulbar neoplasms are rare and in their early stage represent a diagnostic challenge. Chondrosarcoma of the skull is a slow-progressing malignant disease which occurs locally, aggressive with invasion into the surrounding tissues. Dogs with chondrosarcoma of the skull have life expectancy between 210 and 580 days - in our case it was 180 days - after the first alterations on the eye of the dog occurred.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The treatment aims at glycemic control through changes in the patient's diet with or without exercise, but some patients need insulin therapy. An alternative would be to use oral hypoglycemic agents such as glibenclamide (GLIB). The present study aims to analyze the toxic effects of GLIB in fetuses of pregnant rats which received 5 or 20mg/kg doses of GLIB. Glycemic dosage reveals no significant difference between control (deionized water) and treated groups, showing that these concentrations of GLIB were not effective to cause hypoglycemia in rats. The vitality of the fetuses in all groups was 100%. GLIB administration promoted increase in weight and significant changes in measures of external morphological parameters of treated fetuses. Histological analysis revealed that liver lobes, lobules and central lobular veins were well defined for all treatments. However, GLIB animals presented a light brownish precipitate into the center-lobular veins and in the liver parenchyma among the hepatocytes. These results indicated a possible passage of the drug through the blood-placental membrane, without serious changes that impair the development of neither bone tissue, nor the liver of these animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study was carried out on 39 buffaloes suffering from different affections of the salivary ducts. The recorded affections of the salivary ducts in buffaloes include; ectasia of the parotid duct (21 cases), parotid duct fistula (15 cases) and sialocele (3 cases). Each case was subjected to full study including case history, clinical examination, diagnosis, and treatment whenever possible. Exploratory puncture and radiography were used for confirmation of diagnosis. Intraoral marsupialization was performed for treatment of parotid duct ectasia. Salivary fistula was corrected by one of two successful techniques; the first by reconstruction of the parotid duct and the second by ligation of the parotid duct just caudal to the fistula opening. Sialoceles were corrected by removal of the mandibular salivary gland of the affected side.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 320, one-d-old Ross (male) broiler chickens were used to investigate the effects of 0.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g/kg HEM in the diet, on aforementioned factors. The HEM supplementation did not influence the composition of raw thigh meat except for the total phenols and crude ash (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, pH, water-holding capacity (WHC) and acceptability of thigh meat were affecting by administration of HEM in diets (P&lt;0.05). Meat flavor increased in the supplemented groups (P&lt;0.05). According to our data, HEM supplementation decreased the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in various times of storage and improved the liver lipid peroxides and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities at week 6 (P&lt;0.05), but did not influence the catalase activity. Our results reveal that the addition of 7.5 g/kg or higher HEM in diet could be sufficient to increase the antioxidative activity and 2.5 g/kg for meat taste of broilers in maximum levels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Recently, quantitative and objective radiographic measurements have been reported that give new insight into the form and function of the equine digit. We investigated a radio-dense curvilinear profile along the distal phalanx on lateral radiographs we term the Palmar Curve (PC) that we believe provides a measurement of the concavity of the distal phalanx of the horse. A second quantitative measurement, the Palmar Metric (PM) was defined as the percent area under the PC. We correlated the PM and age from 544 radiographs of the distal phalanx from the left and right front feet of various breed horses of known age, and 278 radiographs of the front feet of Quarter Horses. The PM was negatively correlated with age and decreased at a rate of 0.28 % per year for horses of various breeds and 0.33 % per year for Quarter Horses. Therefore, veterinarians should be aware of age related change in the concave, parietal solar aspect of the distal phalanx in the horse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight clinically healthy, adult male dogs, weighing 20 kg were used. All dogs were initially sedated by acepromazine. Thirty minutes later, ketamine plus xylazine was used to induce anesthesia. Surgical incision of laparotomy was done. After a 5 min manipulation of the abdominal organs, the incision was sutured. Vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at the times of -30: premedication, 0: induction and Surgical incision, 30: End of surgery, 60, 90 and 120 min. Blood was sampled at the above mentioned times and analyzed using a commercial ELISA kit for cortisol. A significant decreasing trend in RT was observed during the studied times. No significant changes were observed in heart rate and respiratory rate (p&gt;0.05), except at the time of 60 respiratory rate significantly decreased when compared to the time of 90 (p=0.026) and 120 (p=0.041).

In order for impact to be positive, however, it is critical that users be able to access reliable, trustworthy information. Although more pet owners are using the Internet to research animal health information than ever before, there remains limited research surrounding their online activities or the ability to influence owners' online search behaviors. The current study was designed to assess the online behaviors and perceptions of pet owners after receiving either general or topic-specific information prescriptions as part of their veterinary appointment. Results indicate that nearly 60% of clients accessed the suggested websites and nearly all of these clients reported positive feelings about this addition to their veterinary services. These results suggest that offering information prescriptions to clients can facilitate better online searches by clients and positively impact both animal health and client satisfaction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty eight camels were divided into four groups according to their age and vaccination route. Groups A (n=3) and B (n=3) consisted of non-pregnant lactating female camels, vaccinated through subcutaneous and conjunctival routes, respectively. Groups C (n=10) consisted of 8-11 months old calves vaccinated through conjunctival route. The rest of the herd (n=12) composed of female and young camels were not vaccinated and were considered as the control group. Each animal from groups A, B and C was given the recommended dose of 2 &#215; 10(9) colony forming units of Rev.1 vaccine irrespective of age or route of vaccination. Blood samples were collected from all the animals at the time of vaccination and at weekly, bi-weekly and monthly interval until 32 weeks post vaccination and from controls at weeks 8 and 24. The serological tests used were modified Rose Bengal Test, sero-agglutination test, and an indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Milk samples were collected from all vaccinated female camels and tested for the presence of Rev.1 vaccine strain. Most vaccinated animals started to show an antibody response at week 2 and remained positive until week 16. By week 20 post-vaccination all animals in the three groups were tested negative for Brucella antibodies. Bacteriological analysis of milk samples did not allow any isolation of Brucella melitensis. All samples were found Brucella negative in PCR analysis. The results of this study indicate that the Rev.1 vaccine induces seroconversion in camels. Rev.1 vaccine strain is not excreted in the milk of camels. These findings are promising as to the safe use of the Rev.1 vaccine in camels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Female genitalia of Gaddi sheep (n=190) were collected from unorganized abattoirs around Palampur over a period of one and half years. Out of total genitalia examined, 80.53% were grossly normal and 19.47% had one or more genital abnormalities. Genital abnormalities were categorized as ovarian (5.26%), uterine (10.53%) and miscellaneous (3.68%). Amongst ovarian abnormalities are follicular cysts (3.16%) and ovaro-bursal adhesions (2.10%), which were recorded in Gaddi ewes. Uterine abnormalities include hydrometra (4.74%), pyometra (2.63%), mucometra (2.10%), endometritis (0.53%) and mummification (0.53%). Miscellaneous abnormalities include parovarian cysts (2.10%), parasitic cysts (1.05%) and nodules on both uterine horns (0.53%). Among the genital abnormalities in sheep, highest incidence (24.32%) was observed with hydrometra and lowest (2.7%) with each of endometritis, mummification and nodular growth on both uterine horns. Thus the uterus (54.07%) was most commonly affected, followed by the ovary (27.02%) and miscellaneous (18.91%) in ewes. In present study, 8.95% pregnant sheep were also slaughtered, with fetal age in majority of cases two months or less on the basis of CRL measurement which represents a huge economic loss.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The presence of antibodies against Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), Equine Herpes Virus 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4), West Nile Virus (WNV), Influenza A Virus (IAV), Equine Viral Arteritis Virus (EVAV), Babesia caballi, Theileria equi, Neospora caninum and Chlamydia abortus was determined using commercial assays, and risk factors associated with seropositivity to the different infectious agents was established. The most seroprevalent agent detected was EHV-4 (96.7%), followed by WNV (44.2%), and IAV (41.8%). Horses &gt;3 years, used for work or sports, and with access to pastures, had significantly increased probability to be seropositive to WNV, whereas horses used for breeding and recreational purposes, being stabled, and without access to pastures, had significantly greater probability to be seropositive to IAV. Seroprevalence to B. caballi (19.9%) was lower than to T. equi (38.1%). For B. caballi, access to pastures was determined as a risk factor, whereas being older than 3 years was established as a risk factor for T. equi. Low seroprevalences were determined for EHV-1 (5.0%), EVAV (5.0%), C. abortus (4.8%), and N. caninum (4.4%). Mares having history of abortion were more likely to be seropositive to EHV-1, whereas horses &gt;3 years, used for work and sports, and mares having multiple parturitions, were more likely to be seropositive to N. caninum. None of the horses were seropositive to EIAV. Earlier, only diseases caused by EIAV, WNV and piroplasmosis were reported in Costa Rica. The present study however, determined the presence of carriers for EHV-1, EHV-4, and EIAV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Slaughtered camels (822) were examined for pathological changes of liver abscesses and identification of the involved aerobic bacteria. Grossly, a total of 111 (13.5%) liver abscesses were recorded in different camel ages; 90 (81.1%) were less than seven years old and 21 (18.9%) were more than seven years old. Histopathology of sectioned tissues revealed necrotic abscesses with infiltration of inflammatory cells, hydropic degeneration with swelling of hepatocytes comprising the sinusoid and different size of vacuoles in the hepatic cells. Proliferation of bile ducts with fibrous tissue and infiltration of inflammatory cells was also recorded. Investigation of bacteria revealed 90 aerobic isolates; they were identified to 52 (57.8%) gram positive cocci, 20 (22.2%) gram positive rods and 18 (20.0%) gram negative rods. Staphylococcus spp. (41.1%), Corynebacterium spp. (17.9%) and Streptococcus spp. (13.3%) were the most frequently identified bacteria involved in liver abscesses of camels in the region. Further studies are required to assess the pathogenicity of bacterial isolates from camel livers. This is particularly important from a public health perspective, since some people of Sudan are known to consume raw camel liver.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The ovaries were excised, submerged in normal saline solution (0.9%) and transported to the laboratory for a detailed evaluation. Follicles on each ovary were counted, their diameters (&#934;) measured and were grouped into 3 categories: small (&#934; &lt; 3 mm), medium (3 &#8805; &#934; &#8804; 8 mm) and large (&#934; &gt; 8 mm). Each ovary was then sliced into a petri dish; the oocytes were recovered in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, examined under a stereoscope (x10) and graded into four groups based on the morphology of cumulus oophorus cells and cytoplasmic changes of the oocytes. Grade I (GI): oocytes with more than 4 layers of bunch of compact cumulus cells mass with evenly granulated cytoplasm; grade II (GII): oocyte with at least 2-4 layers of compact cumulus cell mass with evenly granulated cytoplasm; grade III (GIII): oocyte with at least one layer of compact cumulus cell mass with evenly granulated cytoplasm; grade IV (GIV): denuded oocyte with no cumulus cells or incomplete layer of cumulus cell or expanded cells and having dark or unevenly granulated cytoplasm. The effects of both ovarian (ovarian localization, corpus luteum, size and weight of ovary) and non-ovarian factors (breed, age, body condition score (BCS) and pregnancy status of cow) on the follicular population and oocyte recovery rate were determined. There were an average of 16.75&#177;0.83 follicles per ovary. The small, medium and large follicles were 8.39&#177;0.60, 8.14&#177;0.43 and 0.21&#177;0.02 respectively. Oocyte recovery was 10.97&#177;0.43 per ovary (65%). Oocytes graded I, II, III and IV were 3.53&#177;0.19 (32.21%), 2.72&#177;0.15 (24.82%), 2.24&#177;0.15 (20.43%) and 2.47&#177;0.20 (22.54%) respectively. The oocyte quality index was 2.26. Younger non pregnant cows having BCS of 3 and large ovaries presented higher number of follicles and oocyte quality (P &lt; 0.05) compared with other animals. Oocytes with quality (grade I and II) acceptable for IVEP constituted 57.15% of the harvest. This study indicated that factors such as age, pregnancy status, BCS and ovarian size must be taken into account to increase the potential of the ovary for IVEP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The fishes were exposed to a sublethal concentration of 0.2 mg/L of sodium cyanide for duration of 10 and 20 days and were further allowed to undergo recovery for 14 days in a toxicant free medium. From the present investigation findings like occurrence of haemosiderin pigment, melanomacrophage centers, vacuolation and necrotic eosinophils were evident in all the fishes exposed to sodium cyanide. However, changes were more pronounced in fish subjected to 10 days of exposure, which was followed by 20 days of exposure and 14 days of recovery. The study revealed that there seemed to be the presence of homeostatic mechanism in fish that allows them to stabilize and overcome stress, which in present case is caused by sublethal concentration of sodium cyanide. Since the recovery phenomenon may be adaptive and even strategic, the present investigation also throws a light on adaptive behaviour of fish under stressful environments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26623355</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Review on mechanisms of dairy summer infertility and implications for hormonal intervention.</Title>	<Abstract>In dairy cows and buffaloes, summer heat stress (HS) reduces milk yield and delays return to pregnancy leading to financial loss. Clues for effective interventions against summer infertility (SI) lie in understanding the underlying mechanisms. This article reviews current knowledge on the mechanisms of bovine SI and their implication for hormonal management. Under HS dairy animals encounter anestrous, silent cycles and repeat breeding which extend their open period. These effects are attributed mainly to HS induced disturbances in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, follicular dominance and estrogen secretion, ovulation and oocyte competence, luteal development and progesterone secretion, utero-placental function and embryo-fetal development. Hormonal timed artificial insemination protocols and LH support around estrous improved summer pregnancy rates by avoiding need for estrus detection, assisting follicular development and ovulation, enhancing quality oocytes and stimulating luteal function. Progesterone supplementation to enhance embryonic development did not produce significant improvement in summer pregnancy rates. There is need for evaluating integrated approaches combining hormones, metabolic modifier and cyto-protective agents.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Components of variance for the random effects (mixed model) were estimated by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) methodology. Sires were evaluated for the TMY by three methods, Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) using Harvey program, Transmitting Ability (TA) according to the Least Square Means of sire progeny (TALSM) and according to Means (TAM). Results showed that TMY and DP were affected significantly (P &lt; 0.01) by all factors except season of calving and age at first calving, while LL was affected significantly (P&lt; 0.01) only by year of calving and parity. The averages of the TMY, LL, and DP were 3919.66 kg, 298.28 days, and 114.13 days respectively. The corresponding estimates of heritability (h(2)) were 0.35, 0.06, and 0.14 respectively. The highest and lowest BLUP values of sires for the TMY were - 542.44 kg and 402.14 kg, while the corresponding estimates for TALSM and TAM were - 470.38, 380.88 kg and - 370.12, 388.50 kg respectively. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients among BLUP, TALSM and TAM ranged from 0.81 to 0.67. These results provide evidence that the selection of sires will improve the TMY in this herd because of the wide differences in genetic poetical among sires, and a moderate estimation of heritability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Weekly progesterone levels were measured starting one week postpartum until two weeks after the 1(st) postpartum estrus in Barbary ewes lambed during winter in AL-Bayda city, north of Libya. A total of 15 Barbary ewes were used in the present study distributed in three groups according to the month of lambing as group 1 (lambed in January), group 2 (lambed in February) and group 3 (lambed in March). Ewes were examined weekly by trans-rectal ultrasound to check involution of the uterus starting one week after lambing until complete uterine involution. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein, and serum was separated and stored at -20 &#176;C until measuring progesterone using ELISA. Results showed that uterine involution completed at day 35 postpartum in groups 1 and 2, while it occurred at day 28 in group 3. The mean progesterone level was basal (less than 1 ng/ml) for a long period and started to increase at days 119, 99 and 77 postpartum in group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. One ewe did not show estrus at all during the period of study in group 2 and there were no growing follicles on their ovaries. The obtained results indicate that, uterine involution as determined by ultrasound completed earlier in ewes lambed in March than those lambed in February or January. Also, progesterone level and ultrasound examination showed that there was no ovarian activity for a longtime after parturition indicating that reproduction in Barbary ewes tends to be seasonal in AL-Bayda city, north Libya.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is responsible for 80-85% of the primary bone tumors affecting dogs and it is characterized by aggressive and invasive behavior, with a high metastatic potential. Several studies on cancer and related tumorigenesis, show an involvement of the mechanisms of programmed cell death and cell survival. Many signals seem to be involved in the related mechanism of autophagy and in particular, our interest is focused on the expression of a family of Bcl-2 that seems to be involved either in the control of biomolecular mechanisms like autophagy and apoptosis. In this study we investigated the expression of Bcl-2 in different cases of spontaneous canine osteosarcoma and the related preliminary results are described. We found Bcl-2 activity was increased in OS tissue compared to normal bone tissue. These results suggested that Bcl-2 activity may play an important role in the formation of OS and as a diagnostic for neoplastic activity. However, further research is needed to confirm the role of Bcl-2 activity in OS in canines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The results obtained after conservation with 96% ethanol, 1% sodium benzoate and glycerol showed no statistically significant differences in both the shape and the diameter in coiled Trichinella spiralis larvae's over the tested period. Additional advantage of glycerol as conservation liquid toward formalin is a lack of toxicity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Further enlargement of the sublumbar lymph nodes was linked to recurrent hypercalcaemia 3 months after surgical treatment. Medical treatment with Toceranib and Clodronate showed modest results in the treatment of the tumour and the hypercalcaemia. Radiotherapy of the sublumbar lymph nodes and later concurrent carboplatin chemotherapy resulted in partial tumour remission with marked reduction in size of the lymph nodes and normalization of the calcaemia. Unfortunately, concurrently with subsequent relapse of the hypercalaemia, the dog developed hypertrophic osteopathy (HO) and lumbar spinal metastasis and the dog was euthanized. To the authors' knowledge, this is the second case of metastatic apocrine gland carcinoma of the anal sac associated with HO and the first case that describe the development of HO late in the stage of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Gross necropsy revealed liver and lung tumours, which proved to be haemangiosarcomas by histopathology. Some of the liver tumours were ruptured, leading to massive intra-abdominal haemorrhage and death. Haemangiosarcomas are rare in domestic and exotic felids, occurring in skin, thoracic-abdominal cavity and bones. Although these tumours mainly appear to be occurring in older cats, they are sometimes observed in younger animals, as in the present case. This is the first description of haemangiosarcoma in a young Asiatic lion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It was the objective of the present study to visualize microscopically the location of the formazan in boar sperm cells. The MTT staining process of boar sperm cells can be divided into a series of morphological events. Incubation of the sperm cells in the presence of MTT resulted after a few min in a diffuse staining of the midpiece of the sperm cells. Upon further incubation the staining of the midpiece became more intense, and gradually the formation of packed formazan granules became more visible. At the same time, a small formazan stained granule appeared medially on the sperm head, which increased in size during further incubation. After incubation for about 1 h the midpiece granules were intensely stained and more clearly distinct as granules, while aggregation of sperm cells occurred. Around 90% of the sperm cells showed these staining events. At the end of the staining the formazan granules have disappeared from both the sperm cells and medium, whereas formazan crystals appeared as thin crystal threads, that became heavily aggregated in the incubation medium. It was concluded that formazan is taken up by lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. Further, the use of the MTT assay to test for sperm viability should be regarded as a qualitative assay, whereas its practical use at artificial insemination (AI) Stations is limited.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The reproductive performance of gilts and multiparous sows (38 per group) from 8 selected farms were monitored and controlled. Thereafter, piglets were controlled from birth to weaning age. The age at first service (AFS), fertility index (FI), fecundity, age at first farrowing (AFF), weight at first farrowing (WtFF) and litter size (LS) of gilts were 179.97 &#177; 25.40 days; 1.76 &#177; 0.77; 100 &#177; 0.00; 350.47 &#177; 40.58 days; 107.26 &#177; 31.85 kg and 7.18 &#177; 1.93 piglets, respectively. In sows, the FI, fecundity, LS and farrowing interval (FarI) were 1.13 &#177; 0.34; 100 &#177; 0.00; 9.03 &#177; 2.14 piglets and 179.63 &#177; 25.14 days, respectively. FI and LS were better in sows compared to gilts (P = 0.000). The sex ratio was 0.63. Local breed animals reared in semi-modern farms and fed mixed feed showed the lowest WtFF. In piglets, the average birth weight (kg), the average weaning weight (kg), age at weaning (days) and survival rate (%) until weaning were 1.32 &#177; 0.20, 10.60 &#177; 1.41, 56.86 &#177; 8.24 and 48.43, respectively. These results indicated that reproductive performance is strongly influenced by breed, feed and farm type.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although numerous studies have explored grade point average (GPA) as a predictive value of later academic success, there has been little attention paid to how and where an applicant acquires his/her undergraduate coursework. Quality of academic program is an important component of applicant files, and it is suggested that the source of a candidate's coursework might influence admissions committee decisions, perhaps even outside of the committee's immediate awareness. Options for undergraduate education include taking classes at a traditional four-year institution, a community college, or online. This study provides an overview of the current state of online courses and community colleges in the US as a foundation to explore the views of veterinary admissions committee members pertaining to coursework completed at traditional residential 4-year schools or at community colleges and whether they are delivered on campus or online (at either type of institution). Survey participants reported a pattern of preference for traditional four-year residential coursework compared to online or community college courses. These results are interesting given the exponential growth of students taking online courses and data showing community colleges are providing a successful gateway to obtaining a four-year degree. This also points to the need for admission committees to discuss potential biases since the information about type of school and/or course may not be consistently available for all applicants. Finally, at a time when admitting a diverse class of students is a goal of many programs, it is of special concern that there are potential biases against courses taken online or from community colleges - venues that tend to draw a more diverse population than traditional 4-year universities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The results indicate that contrary to the accepted view, the 'Solid' gene was introduced into the British population of Newfoundland dogs in the 1840s. Prior to that time, the dogs were white and black (Landseer) or white and brown, and thus spotted/spotted homozygotes. Due to 'Solid' being dominant over 'spotted', and selective breeding, today the majority of Newfoundland dogs are solid black. Whereas small white marks on the chest and/or paw appears to be a random event, the historical data supports the existence of an 'Irish spotted' fur colour pattern, with white head blaze, breast, paws and tail tip, in spotted/spotted homozygotes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objective was to study three different FOB tests in order to have a new indicator of H. contortus infection in sheep that could be included in the genetic evaluation system as an alternative selection criterion to faecal worm egg count (FEC). A total of 29 Corriedale lambs were experimentally infected with 10.000 larvae of H. contortus. Stool samples were recorded for FEC and FOB tests (Hexagon, Hematest(&#174;) and Multistix(&#174;)), blood for packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin, white and red blood cell count (RBC), and FAMACHA(&#169;) for scoring anaemia. At the end of the experiment lambs were slaughtered to worm burden count. Field infection was achieved in 309 Merino lambs under natural parasite challenge. FEC data were normalized through logarithmic transformation (LnFEC). Pearson correlation was estimated to examine the relationship between all traits. The three tests were able to detect the presence of FOB at day 11. FEC, PCV and RBC decreased to sub-normal values from day 18. FAMACHA(&#169;) score 3 was considered to be indicative of anaemia. Most of the correlations were of high magnitude, with the exception of Multistix(&#174;) test that was moderately correlated with haematological parameters, LnFEC and FEC. In field infection, most samples were negative to FOB tests and the correlations were lower than those calculated under experimental infection. In conclusion, FOB tests were able to detect haemonchosis earlier than FEC under high experimental parasite challenge. However, they were not able to detect FOB under natural mixed parasite challenge. FAMACHA(&#169;) and PCV demonstrated to be good indicators of Haemonchosis, having moderate to high correlations with FEC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 30 African Black unsexed ostrich chicks were used in the present study in simple randomized design. The results of the present work indicated that initial and final live body weight, body weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion of ostrich chicks were insignificantly affected by dietary protein level used. Protein efficiency ratio was high in the group of chicks fed diet contained 18% CP. Results obtained indicated that tibiotarsus girth was decreased (P&#8804;0.01) with the increasing dietary protein level, where the highest value of tibiotarsus girth (18.38 cm) was observed in chicks fed 18% dietary protein level. Body height and tibiotarsus length were not significantly different. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that ostrich chicks (during 2-9 weeks of age) could grow on diets contain lower levels of CP (18%).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cause of intoxication is the application of canine permethrin spot-on product (Advantix&#174;, Bayer) by the owners. Principal clinical guidelines recommends the use of anticonvulsant drugs to treat seizures or neurological symptoms after initial stabilization and dermal decontamination. The use of lipid emulsion had an increasing interest in the last decade for treatment of toxicosis caused by lipophylic drugs as reported in human and in veterinary medical practices. All cats presented in this study, were treated with intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) at variable dosages, and dexmedetomidine was also administered by intravenous way. No adverse reaction such as thrombophlebitis, overload circulation or others was noticed during and after administration of ILE. Dexmedetomidine was proved to be helpful in tranquillizing the cats. All cats were discharged in good condition faster than other cases treated without their use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Antibodies were detected in 19 (5.29%) sheep from 12 (80%) flocks. Seropositive animals were found in all analyzed regions (Central, Chorotega, Atlantic Huetar, North Huetar and Central Pacific) determining prevalence between 0.28% and 4.4%, and intra-flock positivity between 3.7% and 25.0%. The survey revealed two risk factors associated with seropositivity; introducing animals (males and females), embryos, or semen from other farms or from abroad without any sanitary certification, and flocks not having quarantine areas or separated boxes for diseased animals. No clinical signs of disease were observed in positive seroreactors. C. abortus seems to be present in Costa Rica in a very low prevalence in sheep flocks. Further studies, to isolate the bacteria are required. Finally, implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of C. abortus is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Hg, Pb and Cd contaminants were monitored in a total of 60 specimens of fresh little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus) and popular brands of skipjack and yellowfin (Katsuwonus pelamis and Thunnus albacares) canned tuna commercially available in Tripoli, Libya. Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80) was implemented for determination of total Hg level and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) was employed for determination of Cd and Pb concentrations. The results indicated that Hg had the highest concentration level and Cd had the lowest concentration level either in tested canned tuna or fresh little tunny samples. The average concentration of Hg in fresh little tunny samples was 1.185 &#177; 0.968 mg kg(-1) wet weight (ww) and often exceeded the standard permissible limit. In addition, canned yellowfin tuna had the lowest levels of Cd (0.027 &#177; 0.026 mg kg(-1) ww), Pb (0.075 &#177; 0.071) and Hg (0.163 &#177; 0.122 mg kg(-1) ww). Results of the current surveillance indicated that canned skipjack and yellowfin tuna sold in Tripoli markets show contaminant levels well under the European thresholds adopted for Cd, Pb and Hg. However, consumption of large quantities of Mediterranean little tunny products significantly increases human exposure to the risk of Hg toxicity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As the strategy of DIVA requires at least two proteins, we obtained a variant of the nucleoprotein (NP49-375) in E. coli. After its purification by IMAC, the competence of the proteins NP49-375 and HACD as coating antigens in indirect ELISA assays were tested by using the sera of chickens immunized with the proteins HA and HACD and the reference sera from several avian influenza subtypes. Together with these sera, the sera from different species of birds and the sera of chickens infected with other avian viral diseases were analyzed by competition ELISA assays coated with the proteins NP49-375 and HACD. The results showed that the segment CD154 in the chimeric protein HACD did not interfere with the recognition of the molecule HA by its specific antibodies. Also, we observed variable detection levels when the reference sera were analyzed in the ELISA plates coated with the protein NP49-375. Moreover, only the antibodies of the reference serum subtype H5 were detected in the ELISA plates coated with the protein HACD. The competition ELISA assays showed percentages of inhibition of 88-91% for the positives sera and less than 20% for the negative sera. We fixed the cut-off value of these assays at 25%. No antibody detection was observed in the sera from different species of birds or the sera of chickens infected with other avian viral diseases. This study supported the fact that the ELISA assays using the proteins NP49-375 and HACD could be valuable tools for avian influenza surveillance and as a strategy of DIVA for counteracting the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 outbreaks.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The clonal spread of S. aureus among animals and personnel in a Zoological Park was investigated. Samples were collected from colonized and infected sites among 32 mammals, 11 birds and eight humans. The genes mecA, mecC, lukF/lukS-PV (encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin, PVL) and tst (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) were investigated by PCR. Clones were defined by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), spa type and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Seven S. aureus isolates were recovered from four animals and one from an employee. All were mecA, mecC and tst-negative, whereas, one carried the PVL genes and was isolated from an infected Squirrel monkey. Clonal analysis revealed the occurrence of seven STs, eight PFGE and five spa types including ones of human origin. Even though a variety of genotypes were identified among S. aureus strains colonizing zoo park residents, our results indicate that colonization with human lineages has indeed occurred.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Animals were divided into two groups: Young (3-8 years) and aged (11-18 years). They were clinically healthy, and not obese. Plasma adiponectin (ADN) concentrations in aged horses were significantly lower than those in young horses (mean&#177;SE, 6.5&#177;1.3 &#181;g mL(-1) vs, 10.9&#177;1.7 &#181;g mL(-1), Mann-Whitney U test, respectively; P=0.0233). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels and Insulin and malondialdehyde concentrations in aged group tended to increase compared to those in young group although there were not significant differences statistically. In aged group, malate dehydrogenase/lactate dehydrogenase (M/L) ratio, which is considered an energy metabolic indicator, did not change significantly compared to that in young group. Present data suggest that aging may negatively affect nutrition metabolism, but not induce remarkable changes in M/L ratio in riding horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Despite research demonstrating that SGA does not accurately detect subtle lameness, it remains the most commonly performed diagnostic test for detecting lameness in dogs. This is largely because the financial, temporal and spatial requirements for existing objective gait analysis equipment makes this technology impractical for use in general practice. The utility of slow motion video as a potential tool to augment SGA is currently untested. To evaluate a more accessible way to overcome the limitations of SGA, a slow motion video study was undertaken. Three experienced veterinarians reviewed video footage of 30 dogs, 15 with a diagnosis of primary limb lameness based on history and physical examination, and 15 with no indication of limb lameness based on history and physical examination. Four different videos were made for each dog, demonstrating each dog walking and trotting in real time, and then again walking and trotting in 50% slow motion. For each video, the veterinary raters assessed both the degree of lameness, and which limb(s) they felt represented the source of the lameness. Spearman's rho, Cramer's V, and t-tests were performed to determine if slow motion video increased either the accuracy or consistency of raters' SGA relative to real time video. Raters demonstrated no significant increase in consistency or accuracy in their SGA of slow motion video relative to real time video. Based on these findings, slow motion video does not increase the consistency or accuracy of SGA values. Further research is required to determine if slow motion video will benefit SGA in other ways.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The cadmium (Cd) effect on the mitochondrial viability (MV) and acid soluble thiols levels (AST) in A. brevifilis tissues (liver, kidney, heart, and gill) was evaluated. Forty-two fish with similar sizes and weights were randomly selected, of which 7 fish (with their respective replicate) were exposed for 7 and 30 days to a Cd sublethal concentration (0.1 mg.l(-1)). We determined the MV through a Janus Green B colorimetric assay and we obtained the concentration of AST by Ellman's method. Mitochondrial viability decreased in fish exposed to Cd for 30 days with the liver being the most affected tissue. We also detected a significant decrease in AST levels was in fishes exposed to Cd for 7 days in liver and kidney tissues; these results suggests that AST levels are elevated in some tissues may act as cytoprotective and adaptive alternative mechanism related to the ROS detoxification, maintenance redox status and mitochondrial viability. Organ-specifics variations were observed in both assays. We conclude that the Cd exposure effect on AST levels and MV, vary across fish tissues and is related to the exposure duration, the molecule dynamics in different tissues, the organism and environmental conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Such sequences constitute a rich source of data on character evolution, and may even provide phylogenetic information. A pre-hatch developmental study on ossification sequences of axial and appendicular skeletal system in Kuttanad duck embryos was undertaken using 78 viable embryos. From day 3 to day 7 of incubation no ossification densities were seen both by alizarin red staining and computerized radiography. The first indication of ossification as small ossification centers in skull bones, clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius and ulna in forelimb and ilium, pubis femur and fibula in hind limb were observed on the 9(th) day of incubation. The ossification of the body of the ribs started at the 11(th) day of incubation towards the proximal extremity. On day 13(th) the ossification process of vertebrae was started from cervical end. The variation in appearance of the ossification centers in different bones at different stages of incubation period suggests relative importance of phylogeny to the sequences.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The remaining dogs were randomly placed into either group B (GB; n=12) and received doxorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) every three weeks, for six complete cycles or group C (GC; n=15) and treated with RA9-cis at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The time of the recurrence was significantly shorter in the GA and GB compared to GC (P=0.0007; P=0.0015 respectively), while we did not detect differences between GA and GB. The hazard ratio of recurrence between GA and GB compared to GC were 7.25 and 5.60 times shorter, respectively. We did not detect any differences between the other groups. The risk ratio of recurrence was 2.0 times higher in GA compared to GC and 2.1 times higher in GB compared to GC. The type of carcinoma had an effect on time of survival with follicular carcinomas having an increased mean survival time than follicular-compact carcinomas (P&lt;0.0001) and follicular-compact carcinomas had a longer mean survival time than compact carcinomas. The interaction among treatment and type was significant, but survival time in follicular carcinomas did not differ between treatments. In follicular-compact carcinomas the survival time of GC was greater than GB (P&lt;0.05), but we did not detect a difference between GA and GB. In conclusion, this study shows that the use of surgery in combination with RA9-cis treatment significantly increases survival rate and decreases the time to tumor recurrence when compared to doxorubicin treated or untreated dogs. The histological type of carcinoma interacted with treatment for time to recurrence and survival time, with more undifferentiated carcinomas having a worse prognosis than differentiated carcinomas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26862516</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>The pulsed light inactivation of veterinary relevant microbial biofilms and the use of a RTPCR assay to detect parasite species within biofilm structures.</Title>	<Abstract>The presence of pathogenic organisms namely parasite species and bacteria in biofilms in veterinary settings, is a public health concern in relation to human and animal exposure. Veterinary clinics represent a significant risk factor for the transfer of pathogens from housed animals to humans, especially in cases of wound infection and the shedding of faecal matter. This study aims to provide a means of detecting veterinary relevant parasite species in bacterial biofilms, and to provide a means of disinfecting these biofilms. A real time PCR assay was utilized to detect parasite DNA in Bacillus cereus biofilms on stainless steel and PVC surfaces. Results show that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia attach to biofilms in large numbers (100-1000 oo/cysts) in as little as 72 hours. Pulsed light successfully inactivated all test species (Listeria, Salmonella, Bacillus, Escherichia) in planktonic and biofilm form with an increase in inactivation for every increase in UV dose.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, its use should still be cautious. Medicinal plants have potential toxic effects not yet discovered, and may have unproven interactions with other medications. The use of drugs during pregnancy is still very dangerous and vigorously studied; however, there are few studies of herbal medicines in pregnant women. Existing studies prioritize on teratogenic or abortifacient effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the toxic effects of Mikania glomerata Sprengel administration, popularly known as "guaco" during the gestational period of hypertensive rats. For this experimental groups consisting of pregnant Wistar rats received treatments with guaco extract (1 to 2 mL). In order to analyze the possible toxic effects of guaco during pregnancy, weight gain of rats was assessed during pregnancy; reproductive performance of rats, morphological parameters, and fetal placental histology were compared. Although some parameters presented significant differences, we can conclude that changes prioritized by literature, such as toxicity, vasodilation and hypotension, have not been caused by guaco. The only fetal changes observed were due to the maternal hypertension. Some studies have reported vasodilator and hypotensive effects of guaco. However, only a few studies exist, and its actual effects remain unknown. Specific studies should be developed with higher doses of guaco for a definitive conclusion of its toxic and non-toxic effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dianthrone, the main toxic component of S. occidentalis, is known to impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to myofiber degeneration. In this study, fifteen ewes were fed 0%, 2% or 4% of seeds of S. occidentalis for 63 days. Non-specific markers of myocyte injury and electrocardiograms were undertaken at baseline, and at 14, 35, and 63 days after the animals were first fed the diets, while histopathology of heart samples was performed at the very end of the study. Our results showed an increase in serum AST and LDH over time, while CK-MB did not change significantly. Changes that could be ascribed to myocardial damage were not documented in the electrocardiograms. Cardiac histopathology demonstrated only mild-to-moderate vacuolar degeneration, myofiber edema and disarray, structural disorganization, and cellular necrosis. In conclusion, S. occidentalis caused myocardial fiber degeneration in a dose-dependent fashion, but the electrocardiogram was not able to identify these lesions non-invasively. Because the markers of myofiber injury used in this study lack specificity, they may not be used to support cardiac impairment objectively, despite some of them did change over time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several Vibrio spp. are commonly associated with food-borne transmission including Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Microbiological analysis for enumeration and isolation of Vibrio spp. were carried out for a total of 93 samples of seafood, meat and meat products from different geographic localities in Libya (Tripoli, Regdalin, Janzour and Tobruk). Vibrio spp. were detected by conventional cultural and molecular method using PCR and sequencing of 16S rDNA. Out of the 93 cultured samples only 48 (51.6%) yielded colonies on Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salt agar (TCBS) with culture characteristics of Vibrio spp. More than half (n=27) of processed seafood samples (n=46) yielded colonies on TCBS, while only 44.6 % of samples of meat and meat products showed colonies on TCBS. Among cultured seafood samples, the highest bacterial count was recorded in clam with a count of 3.8 &#215;10(4) CFU\g. Chicken burger samples showed the highest bacterial count with 6.5 &#215;10(4) CFU\g. Molecular analysis of the isolates obtained in this study, showed that 11 samples out of 48 (22.9%) were Vibrio spp. Vibrio parahemolyticus was isolated from camel meat for the first time. This study is an initial step to provide a baseline for future molecular research targeting Vibrio spp. foodborne illnesses. This data will be used to provide information on the magnitude of such pathogens in Libyan seafood, meat and meat products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Veterinarians frequently encounter questions about complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) in practice, and the general public has demonstrated increased interest in these areas for both human and animal health. Consequently, veterinary students should receive adequate exposure to the principles, theories, and current knowledge supporting or refuting such techniques. A proposed curriculum guideline would broadly introduce students to the objective evaluation of new veterinary treatments while increasing their preparation for responding to questions about IVM in clinical practice. Such a course should be evidence-based, unbiased, and unaffiliated with any particular CAVM advocacy or training group. All IVM courses require routine updating as new information becomes available. Controversies regarding IVM and CAVM must be addressed within the course and throughout the entire curriculum. Instructional honesty regarding the uncertainties in this emerging field is critical. Increased training of future veterinary professionals in IVM may produce an openness to new ideas that characterizes the scientific method and a willingness to pursue and incorporate evidence-based medicine in clinical practice with all therapies, including those presently regarded as integrative, complementary, or alternative.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

At presentation, the patient was listlessness, dyspnoeic, and hyper-responsive. The clinical examination evidenced dyspnea with cyanosis, altered cardiac rhythm, and hepatomegaly. Electrocardiography showed an advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The liver aspirate was diagnostic for lymphoma. The patient did not respond to supportive therapy and rapidly died. Post-mortem exams confirmed the presence of lymphoma with hepatic involvement. Moreover, a pericardial lymphocytic infiltration and a widespread myocardial nodular localization of lymphoma were evidenced as well. This condition was probably the cause of the cardiac arrhythmia.

Sixty percent of epizootic outbreaks of brucellosis identified in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) originated from Kazakhstan in recent years. Definitive diagnosis of brucellosis remains a difficult task. Precisely for this reason, we evaluated a purified recombinant out membrane protein 28 (rOMP28) of Brucella species (Brucella spp.) produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a diagnostic antigen in an Indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for bovine brucellosis. The gene encoding OMP28 was synthesized using a two-round PCR procedure. In order to produce the rOMP28, the de novo synthesized DNA was cloned into the expression vector pET-22b(+). Then, the rOMP28 was expressed in E. coli system and characterized in the present study. We further estimated the diagnostic potential of purified rOMP28 of Brucella spp. for screening bovine sera. To determine if rOMP28 has a valuable benefit for use in the serodiagnosis of bovine brucellosis, rOMP28-based I-ELISA was performed. Brucella spp. positive (n=62) and Brucella spp. negative (n=28) samples from tube agglutination test (TAT) were positive (n=59) and negative (n=27) by I-ELISA, respectively. These findings show that the rOMP28 of Brucella spp. could be a good candidate for improving serological diagnostic methods for bovine brucellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On post-mortem inspection, a spherical tumor mass attaching to a juvenile ovary was found in the abdominal cavity. Histopathologically, the tumor was comprised of immature mesenchymal stroma and a variety of mature tissue elements of mesodermal and ectodermal origin. In addition, there were multiple indistinguishable tissue elements, which showed no malignant cytological features but were unidentifiable as to corresponding embryological layer of origin. These heterogeneous teratoma tissues consisted of a variety of glandular, cystic, duct-like, and tubular structures, some of which exhibited a lining by a mixture of both keratinizing/non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelial cells and cuboidal/columnar epithelial cells. The ovarian tetatoma was considered a benign and congenital one. The highly diverse differentiation of the teratoma might have manifested a morphological aspect of intrinsic character of the pluripotential germ cells during tumorigenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>27419101</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Phylogenetic analysis of some Newcastle disease virus isolates from the Sudan.</Title>	<Abstract>A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify 1412 bp of the fusion protein gene (F gene) of four Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates; two velogenic (TY-1/90 and DIK-90) and two lentogenic isolates (Dongla 88/1 and GD.S.1). Following sequencing, nucleotide sequences were annotated and 894 bp were compared phylogenetically with those from strains previously reported in the Sudan and the virus strains published on the GenBank. It could be demonstrated that TY-1/90 and DIK-90 strains belong to the genotype VI of NDV and are in close genetic relationship to sub- genotype VIb. TY-1/90 and DIK-90 strains were observed to be genetically unrelated to the earlier Sudanese isolates of 1970/80s and the late of 2000s suggesting a different origin. The close genetic relationship to the European and African pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) suggests a common ancestor. Dongola, GD.S.1 strains were classified into genotype II that comprises non-pathogenic lentogenic NDV strains. The present genetic classification of NDV isolates of the Sudan provides valuable information on genotypes of NDV. Further molecular epidemiological investigations of the recent outbreaks of Newcastle disease in the Sudan are needed in order to improve the efficiency of control strategies and vaccine development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A prospective feasibility study.</Title>	<Abstract>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of imaging-guided core needle biopsy for canine orbital mass diagnosis. A second excisional biopsy obtained during surgery or necropsy was used as the reference standard. A prospective feasibility study was conducted in 23 canine orbital masses at a single centre. A complete ophthalmic examination was always followed by orbital ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) examination of the head. All masses were sampled with the patient still on the CT table using ultrasound (US) guided automatic tru-cut device. The most suitable sampling approach to the orbit was chosen each time based on the CT image analysis. One of the following different approaches was used: trans-orbital, trans-conjunctival or trans-masseteric. In all cases, the imaging-guided biopsy provided a sufficient amount of tissue for the histopathological diagnosis, which concurred with the biopsies obtained using the excisional technique. CT examination was essential for morphological diagnosis and provided detailed topographic information that allowed us to choose the safest orbital approach for the biopsy. US guided automatic tru-cut biopsy based on CT images, performed with patient still on the CT table, resulted in a minimally invasive, relatively easy, and accurate diagnostic procedure in dogs with orbital masses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Whether different ACE-inhibitors have distinct kidney protective effects is unknown; it is therefore hypothesized that renal diets and enalapril or benazepril have different beneficial effects in proteinuric CKD dogs. Forty-four dogs with proteinuric CKD (IRIS stages 1-4) were enrolled in the study and were fed renal diet for 30 days. Thereafter, they were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. Dogs in group A (n=22) received enalapril (0.5 mg/kg, q12h) and in group B (n=22) benazepril (0.5 mg/kg, q24h); in both groups, dogs were fed the same renal diet. After randomization, dogs were monitored for 120 days. Body weight and body condition score (BCS), serum concentrations of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin and total proteins, and urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio were compared at different time-points. After 30 days of renal diet, creatinine, BUN and UPC ratio decreased significantly (p&lt;0.0001). Compared to randomization, body weight, BCS, albumin, total proteins, creatinine and BUN did not vary during follow-up in the 44 dogs and differences between group A and B were not observed. However, the UPC ratio of group A at day 60, 90 and 150 was significantly lower than in group B and compared to randomization (p&lt;0.05). In group B it did not vary overtime. It is concluded that the renal diet is beneficial to decrease creatinine, BUN and UPC ratio in proteinuric CKD dogs. Enalapril further ameliorates proteinuria if administered along with renal diet.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cumulus oocytes complexes (COCs) were aspirated from follicles of 2-8 mm diameter. In experiment I, COCs were matured in IVM medium supplemented with 0 (control), 250, 500, and 1000 &#956;M melatonin for 22-24 hours in CO2 incubator at 38.5&#176;C with 5% CO2 and at 95% relative humidity. The maturation rate did not differ in media supplemented with melatonin at 250 &#956;M, 500 &#956;M, 1000 &#956;M and control (0 &#956;M). In experiment II, the matured oocytes were fertilized in 50 &#956;l droplets of Tyrode's Albumin Lactate Pyruvate (TALP) medium having 10 ug/ml heparin for sperm (2 million/ml) capacitation. The fertilization droplets were then kept for incubation at 5% CO2, 39&#176;C and at 95% relative humidity for 18 hours. The fertilization rate was assessed by sperm penetration and pronuclear formation. Fertilization rate was improved when maturation medium was supplemented with 250 &#956;M melatonin compared to control. In conclusion, melatonin supplementation to serum free maturation media at 250 &#956;M improved the fertilization rate of buffalo oocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tamaulipas is located northeast of Mexico, an important cattle production and the principal exporter of calf and heifer to the United States. The objectives of this study were to estimate the seroprevalence of BoHV-1 and of BVDV, and to determine the effects of risk factors on these infections. Blood samples of cattle from 57 farms from rural districts of Tamaulipas were collected. The samples were tested for antibodies against BoHV-1 and BVDV using commercial ELISA kits. Data on potential risk factors were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the farmer at the time the blood samples were taken. The seroprevalences for BoHV-1 and BVDV were 64.4% and 47.8%, respectively. In the logistic regression analysis, the significant risk factors were rural district, herd size and cattle introduced to the farm. This study confirms the high seroprevalence of BoHV-1 and BVDV in unvaccinated cattle in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The results of this study could be used for the development of BoHV-1 and BVDV prevention and control program in North-Eastern, Mexico.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Trichloroethane (TCE), a ubiquitous environmental toxicant, is used in large quantities as a dissolvent, metal degreaser, chemical intermediate, and component of consumer products. This increases the likelihood of human exposure to these compounds through dermal, inhalation and oral routes. The present in vivo study was aimed to investigate the possible cellular and molecular etiology of liver abnormality induced by early exposure to TCE using a murine model. The results showed a significant increase in liver weight. Histopathological examination revealed a TCE-induced hepatotoxicity which appeared as heavily congested central vein and blood sinusoids as well as leukocytic infiltration. Mitotic figures and apoptotic changes such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragments were also identified. Cell death analysis demonstrates hepatocellular apoptosis was evident in the treated mice compared to control. TCE was also found to induce oxidative stress as indicated by an increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation, an oxidative stress marker. There was also a significant decrease in the DNA content of the hepatocytes of the treated groups compared to control. Agarose gel electrophoresis also provided further biochemical evidence of apoptosis by showing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the liver cells, indicating oxidative stress as the cause of DNA damage. These results suggest the need for a complete risk assessment of any new chemical prior to its arrival into the consumer market.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Two adrenal neoplasms were identified incidentally by ultrasonography, and tumor in the left thyroid lobe was identified by palpation. Primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed by biochemical testing. Histopathology report was consistent with diagnosis of bilateral pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for calcitonin and synaptophysin, and negative for thyroglobulin, which confirmed medullary thyroid carcinoma. This case in a dog is presenting neoplastic characteristics similar to human MEN 2A and emphasizing the importance of using immunohistochemistry for confirmation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty students who had undertaken a practical class on canine fundoscopy involving both use of artificial model eyes and live dogs were asked to complete a short questionnaire using a Likert scale to gauge their opinion on whether the use of live dogs and artificial eyes was very valuable (scoring 2), valuable (1), a neutral response (0), not particularly valuable (-1) or not at all valuable (-2) and to write a free text response on their views of the educational value and welfare implications of using artificial model eyes or live dogs in training for ophthalmic examination of the canine ocular fundus. Likert responses were 1.84&#177;0.37 for using live greyhounds and 0.58&#177;0.79 for using simulator eyes (p&lt;0.0001). Thematic analysis of the written responses showed that while the artificial eyes were considered somewhat valuable in initial training, the live dogs were significantly preferred for their realism and the opportunity to examine the eye while handling a live animal. In conclusion, while model eyes are valuable initial training in use of the ophthalmoscope for funduscopic examination, students consider that examining the eye in the live dog is significantly more valuable and that the welfare of dogs thus used is not in their view unduly compromised.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The metabolic and immune responses of the host depend on parasite species and tissues affected by the parasite. This study investigated metabolic and immuno-inflammatory responses of mice infected with tissue-dwelling larvae of Trichinella zimbabwensis and explored the relationship between infection, metabolic parameters and Th1/Th17 immune responses. Sixty (60) female BALB/c mice aged between 6 to 8 weeks old were randomly assigned into T. zimbabwensis-infected and control groups. Levels of Th1 (interferon-&#947;) and Th17 (interleukin-17) cytokines, insulin and blood glucose were determined as well as measurements of body weight, food and water intake. Results showed that during the enteric phase of infection, insulin and IFN-&#947; levels were significantly higher in the Trichinella infected group accompanied with a reduction in the trends of food intake and weight loss compared with the control group. During systemic larval migration, trends in food and water intake were significantly altered and this was attributed to compensatory feeding resulting in weight gain, reduced insulin levels and increased IL-17 levels. Larval migration also induced a Th1/Th17 derived inflammatory response. It was concluded that T. zimbabwensis alters metabolic parameters by instigating host compensatory feeding. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that non-encapsulated T. zimbabwensis parasite plays a role in immunomodulating host Th1/Th17 type responses during chronic infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Retrospective evaluation of all CT examinations of patients having portosystemic shunt (PSS) was performed in a 4-year time period. All anomalous porto-caval connections were assessed for anatomical pattern and compared with published veterinary literature. Records of 25 dogs were reviewed. 16 dogs had a single CPSS (CPSS group), and 9 dogs had multiple acquired PSS secondary to PH (APSS group). The splenophrenic shunt pattern was found in 3 dogs of the CPSS group as a single congenital anomaly without PH and in 2 dogs of the APSS group associated with MAPSS and ascites due to different hepatic diseases causing PH. These findings corroborate two hypotheses: 1) Splenophrenic PSS should be considered as a classical CPSS but if this is not sufficient to alleviate a PH developed after birth because of eventual hepatic or portal diseases, in this case ascites and acquired portal collaterals may develop. In this case, MAPSS and CPSS may coexist. 2) The pattern of splenophrenic PSS, classically described among CPSS, may develop as acquired portal collateral in dogs with PH and it should also be included in the category of APSS. These preliminary findings may be helpful in reconsidering the classical haemodynamics of porto-caval diseases, enrich the classification of APSS in dogs and refine the imaging evaluation of patients with PH.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The remedy may be analysis according to a systematic review, allowing comprehensive and accessible treatment of evidence and reasoning, clarifying the issue and specifying the uncertainties. Systematic reviews have clearly formulated questions, can identify relevant studies and appraise their quality and can summarise evidence and reasoning with an explicit methodology. The present venture lays a foundation for a possible systematic review and applies three lines of evidence and reasoning to two questions. The first question is whether scrapie transmits prenatally in sheep and goats. It leads to the second question, which concerns the sanitary safety of artificial breeding technologies, and is whether scrapie transmits in sheep and goats by means of semen and washed or unwashed in vivo derived embryos. The three lines of evidence derive from epidemiological, field and clinical studies, experimentation, and causal reasoning, where inferences are made from the body of scientific knowledge and an understanding of animal structure and function. Evidence from epidemiological studies allow a conclusion that scrapie transmits prenatally and that semen and embryos are presumptive hazards for the transmission of scrapie. Evidence from experimentation confirms that semen and washed or unwashed in vivo derived embryos are hazards for the transmission of scrapie. Evidence from causal reasoning, including experience from other prion diseases, shows that mechanisms exist for prenatal transmission and transmission by semen and embryos in both sheep and goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sixteen strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from different species of animals (dog, cat, horse, penguin and brown bear) with ocular surface diseases such as conjunctivitis, keratocojnuctivits sicca and ulcerative keratitis. These isolates were tested against 11 different antimicrobials agents using the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using E-tests for two antibiotics (tobramycin and ciprofloxacin) commonly used in veterinary ophthalmology practice. Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic, with 100% of the strains being susceptible, followed by amikacin (87.5%), gentamicin, norfloxacin, gatifloxacin and polymyxin (both with 81.5%of susceptibility). MIC90 of ciprofloxacin was 2 &#181;g/ml and the values found ranged from 0.094 &#181;g/ml to 32 &#181;g/ml. For tobramycin, MIC90 was 32 &#181;g/ml and ranged from 0.25 &#181;g/ml to 256 &#181;g/ml. The most effective in vitro antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa in this study was imipenem, followed by amikacin. The 3 mg/ml eye drops commercially available ciprofloxacin presentations were in vitro effective against all strains tested in this study if applied up to 4 hours after instillation. Whereas for tobramycin the 3 mg/ml eye drops commercial presentations were not in vitro effective against some strains isolated in this study. Thus for ocular infections with P. aeruginosa when using tobramycin the ideal recommendation would be to either use eye drops with higher concentrations or decrease the frequency intervals from four to a minimum of every two hours.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An Argentine dogo bitch showed a solid, compact thyroid tumor, which was IHC negative for the expression of calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, thyroglobulin and S100 protein, and positive for synaptophysin and cytokeratin AE1-AE3. The Ki-67 proliferation index was low. We cite this case not only because it is the first case report of calcitonin-negative primary neuroendocrine tumor of the thyroid in dogs but also because we want to highlight the diagnostic importance of IHC in this regard.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Moreover, many defects are still not reported in veterinary literature. This report documents clinical and radiographic findings in three dogs with congenital deformity involving the distal extremities. Case 1 was affected with bilateral aphalangia of the pedes, case 2 presented a combination of brachydactyly and syndactyly, whereas in case 3 a unilateral ectrodactyly was observed. To the authors' knowledge, brachydactyly, as well as aphalangia, are very uncommon anomalies and have been rarely documented. Moreover, association between syndactyly and brachydactyly has still not been reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The horse was bright, alert and responsive with a 15 x 12 cm ulcerated lesion on the ventral side of the penis. The lesion was the tumor bed of an incompletely excised fibrosarcoma. After complete staging procedures, the owner elected to treat the horse with electrochemotherapy (ECT) using cisplatin as chemotherapy agent. Two sessions of ECT were performed at two-week intervals using local cisplatin followed by trains of biphasic electric pulses applied using different electrodes until complete coverage of the area was achieved. The treatment was well tolerated, and the patient is still disease free after 12 months. ECT resulted in improved local control and should be considered among the available adjuvant treatments in equines carrying soft tissue tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The thoracic duct was successfully imaged using computed tomography after the injection of an iodine contrast agent into the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the anus. The thoracic duct was successfully ligated and pericardectomy performed via an open thoracotomy. Pleural effusion improved but relapsed a week after the surgery. A second lymphography revealed a collateral thoracic duct that was not detected during the first lymphography. The collateral duct was ligated and chylothorax was resolved after the second surgery. The lymphography applied in this study was minimally-invasive and easily provided images of the thoracic duct in a dog with chylothorax.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

IGF-1, IGF-1R and VEGF expression was higher in fibroblasts and endothelial cells of compact carcinoma than in healthy glands (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to follicular-compact carcinoma, compact carcinoma had higher IGF-1R expression in fibroblasts, and higher FGF-2 expression in endothelial cells (P &lt; 0.05). RAR&#945; expression was higher in endothelial cells of compact carcinoma than in those of other groups (P &lt; 0.05).

Normal hematology profile blood test and cerebrospinal fluid analysis excluded infectious encephalitis, and serological testing for Sarcocystis neurona was negative. The filly was euthanized. Postmortem X-ray radiography of the cervical cephalic region identified not abnormalities, discounting spinal trauma. The histopathological analysis of serial transverse cerebellar sections by electron microscopy revealed morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells with pyknotic nuclei and degenerate mitochondria, cytoplasmic condensation and areas with absence of Purkinje cells, matching with CA histopathological characteristics. The indirect DNA test for CA was positive in the filly, and DNA test confirmed the CA carrier state in the parents and the recessive inheritance of the disease. To our knowledge this is the first report of a CA case in Argentina.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Portugal has a long tradition of horse breeding and exportation and until recently was considered CEM-free. However, in 2008, T. equigenitalis was isolated at our laboratory from a recently imported stallion and 2 mares from the same stud. Following this first reported outbreak, the Portuguese Veterinary Authority (DGVA) performed mandatory testing on all remaining equines at the stud (n=30), resulting in a further 4 positive animals. All positive animals were treated and subsequently tested negative for T. equigenitalis. Since this outbreak, over 2000 genital swabs from Portuguese horses have been tested at our laboratory, with no further positive animals identified. The available data suggests that this CEM outbreak was an isolated event and we have no further evidence of CEM cases in Portugal, however, an extended and wider epidemiological study would be needed to better evaluate the incidence of the disease in Portuguese horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

During the spring of 2013, a countrywide serosurvey was undertaken to assess the level of FMD virus circulation and identify FMD virus serotypes in the country. A total of 4221 sera were collected, comprising samples from large ruminants (LR; n=1428 samples from 357 farms) and small ruminants (SR; n=2793 samples from 141 farms). FMD sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies determined by ELISA were 19.0% (271/1428) with 95% CI (16.9 - 21.0) and 13.5% (378/2793) with 95% CI (12.3 - 14.8) for LR and SR samples, respectively. The sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies in LR was 12.3% and 19.8% for age group &lt; 1 year and &#8805; 1 year, respectively (X[2]= 4.95, P= 0.026), while in SR was 3.7%, 13.6% and 21.3% for age group &lt; 1 year, 1-2 year and &gt; 2 year, respectively (X[2]= 118.1, P= 0.000). These observed NSP serologic profiles support the hypothesis of an endemic level of FMD circulation in Libya. All positive sera were tested for SP antibodies for O, A and SAT-2 FMD virus serotypes. Serotype O was the dominant circulating serotype followed by serotype A, while evidence of SAT-2 was not found. These data provide an insight into the wider epidemiology of FMD in Libya, and contribute to field and laboratory investigations that during 2013 serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage) was isolated from clinical samples collected from the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Because TGF-&#946;1induces fibrosis and is elevated in humans suffering from diabetes mellitus we measured this growth factor in serum of dogs with diabetes mellitus and compared it with healthy dogs and those with fibrotic diseases. Further we measured the expression of TGF-&#946;1receptor on lens capsule to investigate possible association between diabetes mellitus and cataract associated alterations. TGF-&#946;1 was measured in serum of 12 dogs with diabetes mellitus, 20 healthy controls and 12 dogs with fibrotic diseases. Dogs with diabetes mellitus and fibrotic diseases have significantly increased TGF-&#946;1 serum concentrations compared to healthy controls. Some dogs with diabetes mellitus showed increased expression of TGF-&#946;1 receptor in lens capsule. Based on our observations we can conclude that TGF-&#946;1 elevation in dogs with diabetes mellitus may induces complications of the disease and may participates on lens alteration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty clinically and ophthalmologically normal canine patients (between the ages of 2 and 6 years) of varying breed and sex were used in this study. Animals were randomly divided into four groups of ten and given one drop of tropicamide, atropine, phenylephrine or saline into one eye. IOP and HPD were measured in both eyes every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. Tropicamide increased IOP by 8.8&#177;4.0 mmHg 35 minutes post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (P&lt;0.01) only in treated eye. IOP in the contralateral eye did not increase. With atropine the maximum increase in IOP was 2.6&#177;2.8 mmHg at 20 minutes post treatment in the treated eye (P&lt;0.01). IOP in the contralateral eye did not increase. Phenylephrine increased IOP by 2.3&#177;2.1 mmHg (P&lt;0.05) 10 minutes after treatment. Also in the untreated eye IOP increased by 2.3&#177;2.1 mmHg, 20 minutes post-treatment. Maximum HPD in eyes treated with tropicamide occurred at 55 minutes and with atropine at 60 minutes. There were no HPD changes in the contralateral, untreated eye. Topical 10% phenylephrine showed maximal pupil dilation 60 minutes after treatment, but the HPD of the - untreated eye slightly decreased at 15 minutes, but this change only reached statistical significance at 40 min post- treatment (P&lt;0.05). Normal saline showed no influence on IOP or HPD. The drugs investigated here show a significant increase in IOP after mydriatics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The affected animals were compared with two other tiger cubs that had been nursed by their dam naturally. After the first clinical signs appeared, the tiger cubs underwent ophthalmic evaluation. Severe symmetric generalized alopecia over the trunk, sparing the head and distal portion of the front and rear limbs, bilateral cataracts and strabismus were noticed. Milk and blood from the mother, as well as blood from the healthy and affected cubs were collected in order to evaluate complete blood counts, serum chemistry values, and amino acid levels. The amino acid concentrations in the artificial formula were also evaluated for comparison to the milk from the dam. The concentration of taurine, arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and histidine were very low in the artificial formulas as compared to the dam&#180;s milk. The tiger cubs that received the artificial formula had lower levels of the amino acids listed previously as compared to those that nursed from the dam naturally. Taurine, as well as arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and histidine deficiency appeared to be possible causes of the development of skin problems, cataracts and strabismus in the tiger cubs fed with these particular artificial milk replacers. In the future, special attention should be given in order to make sure that adequate levels of these amino acids are present in artificial milk for tiger cubs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Argentina, the prevalence of CAEV infections is increasing, with goats showing symptoms associated mostly with cachexia and arthritis. Although in Argentina the virus has been detected by serology, it has never been isolated or characterized. Thus, the objectives of this work were to isolate and analyze the nucleotide sequences of the gag gene of Argentine CAEV strains and compare them with those of other SRLVs previously reported. Nucleotide sequence comparison showed homology with CAEV-Co, the CAEV prototype. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Argentine strains clustered with genotype B, subtype B1. Because the molecular characterization of the gag region is suitable for phylogenetic studies and may be applied to monitor the control of SRLV, molecularly characterizing the Argentine CAEV strains may help develop a proper plan of eradication of CAEV infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pain and decreased mobility resulting from osteoarthritis often have a negative impact on the affected canine's quality of life, level of comfort, daily functioning, activity, behaviour, and client-pet companionship. Despite limited and conflicting evidence, the natural products glucosamine hydrochloride (HCl) and chondroitin sulfate are commonly recommended by veterinarians for treating osteoarthritis in dogs. There is a paucity of well-designed clinical veterinary studies investigating the true treatment effect of glucosamine and chondroitin. The purposes of this review article are to provide a brief background on glucosamine and chondroitin use in canine osteoarthritis and to critically review the available literature on the role of these products for improving clinical outcomes. Based on critical review, recommendations for practice are suggested and a future study design is proposed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to ascertain the health status and the vector-borne pathogens infecting dogs living in public areas with high levels of human movement in the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil. Blood samples from 21 neighborhood dogs that were found in nine of 22 bus stations and two public parks were subjected to a complete blood cell (CBC) count, serum biochemical profiling, a commercial rapid ELISA test and a commercial real-time PCR panel of vector-borne diseases. The CBC count and serum biochemical profiling were within the normal range for dogs and only 1/21 (4.7%) of the dogs was seroreactive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. The commercial real-time PCR panel showed that 7/21 (33.3%) of the dogs had Mycoplasma haemocanis infection, 9/21 (42.8%) had 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum' and 4/21 (19.0%) had both. No statistical association between infected by the agents found here and abnormalities in physical examinations, laboratory tests or ectoparasite presence was found (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, neighborhood dogs showed low prevalence of vector-borne diseases and satisfactory wellbeing, and dogs can be used as sentinels for disease exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Lateral survey radiography of the neck with flexion revealed atlantoaxial subluxation with ventral subluxation of C2. Computed tomography revealed absence of dens and atlanto-occipital overlapping. Magnetic resonance imaging showed compression of the spinal cord and indentation of caudal cerebellum. The diagnosis was Chiari-like malformation, atlantoaxial subluxation with ventral displacement of C2, atlanto-occipital overlapping, and syringomyelia. The dog underwent foramen magnum decompression, dorsal laminectomy of C1, and ventral fixation of the atlantoaxial joint. Soon after the operation, voluntary movements of the legs were recovered. Finally, the dog could stand and walk without assistance. The dog had complicated malformations at the craniocervical junction but foramen magnum decompression and dorsal laminectomy for Chiari-like malformation, and ventral fixation for atlantoaxial subluxation resulted in an excellent clinical outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The mean RI and PI values across all eyes were 0.44&#177;0.10 and 0.62&#177;0.20 respectively. Low RI and PI values found in the harpy eagle&#180;s pectinis oculi artery compared with the American pekin ducks one and other tissue suggest indeed a high metabolic activity in pecten oculi and corroborates the hypothesis of a nutritional function and/or intraocular pressure regulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28540255</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison and validation of ELISA assays for plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 in the horse.</Title>	<Abstract>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays several important physiological roles, and IGF-related pathways have been implicated in developmental osteochondral disease and endocrinopathic laminitis. This factor is also a downstream marker of growth hormone activity and its peptide mimetics. Unfortunately, previously used assays for measuring equine IGF-1 (radioimmunoassays and ELISAs) are no longer commercially available, and many of the kits on the market give poor results when used on horse samples. The aim of the present study was to compare three different ELISA assays (two human and one horse-specific). Plasma samples from six Standardbreds, six ponies and six Andalusians were used. The human IGF-1 ELISA kit from Immunodiagnostic Systems (IDS) proved to be the most accurate and precise of the three kits; the other two assays gave apparently much lower concentrations, with poor recovery of spiked recombinant human IGF-1 and unacceptably poor intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV). The IDS assay gave an intra-assay CV of 3.59 % and inter-assay CV of 7.31%. Mean percentage recovery of spiked IGF-1 was 88.82%, and linearity and dilutional parallelism were satisfied. The IGF-1 plasma concentrations were 123.21 &#177;8.24 ng/mL for Standardbreds, 124.95 &#177;3.69 ng/mL for Andalusians and 174.26 &#177;1.94 ng/mL for ponies. Therefore of the three assays assessed, the IGF-1 ELISA manufactured by IDS was the most suitable for use with equine plasma samples and may have many useful applications in several different research areas. However, caution should be used when comparing equine studies where different analytical techniques and assays may have been used to measure this growth factor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A study was conducted to establish geospatial database on poultry farms in Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi region of Libya, to evaluate the biosecurity level of each farm and to determine the seroprevalence of mycoplasma and its relation to biosecurity level. A field team of 7 Veterinarians belongs to the National Center of Animal Health was assigned for data recording and collection of blood samples. Personal information of the producers, geographical locations, biosecurity measures and description of the poultry farms were recorded. The total number of poultry farms in Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi Region is 461 farms distributed in 13 cities. Out of these, 102 broiler farms and one broiler breeder farm (10 houses) which were in operation during team visit were included in this study. Following collection of blood, sera were separated and tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies against Mycoplasma (General antigen for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae). The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in the region was 28% (29 poultry farms out of 103 were infected). About 50% (23 out of 47) of poultry farms located in Garian city were infected with Mycoplasma and one significant cluster of Mycoplasma infection in the city was identified. Low level of biosecurity was found in poultry farms of the region. Out of the 103 farms included, 63% of poultry houses has a ground of soil and 44% of them has uncoated walls which may influence the proper cleaning and disinfection. Almost 100% of the farms are at risk of exposure to diseases transmitted by wild birds such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease due to absence of wild birds control program. Although, 81% of the farms have entry restrictions, only 20% have disinfectants at entry which increase the risk of exposure to pathogens. The results of this study highlight the weakness points of biosecurity measures in poultry farms of Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi region and high seroprevalence of mycoplasma. Data collected in this study will assist the Veterinary authorities to apply effective disease control strategies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A precise morphologic imaging assessment, along with clinical and histopathologic findings, is important for distinguishing patients with PH from those with congenital PSSs, which require different therapeutic approach. Expected findings in patients with PH are presence of ascites, multiple APSS, and a confirmed cause of portal flow obstruction. On the other hand, a single PSS, absence of ascites and no evidence of portal vein, caudal vena cava or hepatic disorders are typical findings of CPSS patients. This paper describes four cases of PSSs in which the combination of the computed tomographic imaging findings did not match the standards for APSS nor for CPSS: one dog had chronic hepatitis causing PH and ascites and a splenoazygos PSS, to date considered a CPSS pattern. One dog showed a left splenogonadal PSS and porto-caval varices, to date considered an APSS pattern, without ascites, portal vein obstruction, primary structural hepatic disorders nor evidence of PH. Two cats, with and without diffuse hepatic structural disorders respectively, had a single left splenogonadal PSS without ascites. Possible interpretation of such unusual haemodynamic conditions and clinical repercussion, especially for orientation of treatment choice, are discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They are most commonly of epithelial origin and benign. In this report, we describe the cases of two sibling Czech wolfdogs presented, one year apart, with a subcutaneous mass involving the left eyelid. Both lesions were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of subcutaneous fibrosarcoma. Immunohistochemical analyses of the tumors revealed a mild positivity for vimentin and negativity for GFAP, desmin, &#945;SMA, myoglobin, S100, PNL2 and calponin, excluding all differential diagnosis (i.e. peripheral nerve sheath tumor, melanoma, perivascular sarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma). To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first report of canine eyelid fibrosarcoma. Since this rare tumor has been observed in two full siblings, we could speculate the existence of some genetic predisposition to sarcoma, however the present data did not allow any definite conclusion on the etiopathogenesis or genetic basis of these tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There are multiple motivations behind this emerging practice with the recognition of several serious potential opioid-related adverse effects including opioid induced hyperalgesia, opioid tolerance and immunomodulatory effects of opioids. Opioids have long been the mainstay of veterinary anaesthesia and pain management practice. The feasibility of OFA in veterinary patients is presented here. A case series of three dogs that underwent OFA for canine ovariohysterectomy is reported. The authors conclude OFA is possible in veterinary medicine; however the move away from the familiar effects of opioids perioperatively is challenging. Gaining experience with these types of protocols for standard procedures in healthy animals, such as neutering, will provide the anaesthetist with the building blocks for more invasive surgeries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The mare was presented for evaluation of a severe hind limb lameness of approximately 4 months duration. On presentation, a non-weight bearing lameness of the left hind limb with severe effusion and soft tissue swelling of the stifle region was noted. Radiographic evaluation of the stifle revealed a large SCL of the MFC with associated osteoarthritis. Arthroscopic guided intra-lesional injection of the SCL with corticosteroids and autologous bone marrow concentrate was performed followed by ESWT of the MFC. The mare was discharged walking comfortably 48-hours post-operatively. An acute increase in lameness was noted 14 days post-operatively. Imaging revealed catastrophic fracture of the left MFC. Possible mechanisms leading to failure of the MFC secondary to the described treatment are discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

IOP and STT values were recorded in both ulcerated and non-ulcerated (control) eyes of 100 dogs diagnosed with unilateral corneal ulceration. Dogs presented with other ocular conditions as their primary complaint were excluded from this study. The mean &#177; standard deviation for STT values in the ulcerated and control eyes were 20.2&#177;4.6 mm/min and 16.7&#177;3.5 mm/min respectively. The mean &#177; standard deviation for IOP in the ulcerated and control eyes were 11.9&#177;3.1 mmHg and 16.7&#177;2.6 mmHg respectively. STT values were significantly higher (p&lt;0.000001) in the ulcerated eye compared to the control eye while IOP was significantly lower (p&lt;0.0001). There is an increase in lacrimation and a decrease in IOP in canine eyes with corneal ulceration. The higher tear production in ulcerated eyes shows the importance of measuring STT in both eyes in cases of corneal ulceration, since this increased lacrimation may mask an underlying keratoconjunctivitis sicca only evident in the contralateral eye. The lower IOP in ulcerated eyes is likely to relate to mild uveitic change in the ulcerated eye with a concomitant increase in uveoscleral aqueous drainage. While these changes in tear production and IOP in ulcerated eyes are widely recognised in both human and veterinary ophthalmology, it appears that this is the first controlled documented report of these changes in a large number of individuals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We describe a four-horned Jacob lamb that exhibited progressive congenital hindlimb ataxia and paresis, and was euthanased four weeks post-partum. Necropsy and CT-scan revealed deformity and asymmetry of the occipital condyles, causing narrowing of the foramen magnum and spinal cord compression. Histopathology demonstrated Wallerian degeneration of the cervical spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. These findings are consistent with occipital condylar dysplasia. This condition has been infrequently reported in the literature as a suspected heritable disease of polycerate Jacob sheep in the USA, and is assumed to arise during selection for the polycerate trait. This is the first reported case in European-bred Jacob sheep. Occipital condylar dysplasia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in polycerate Jacob lambs showing ataxia. It is important to raise awareness of this disease due to its suspected heritability and link to the popular polycerate trait.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therapeutic and diagnostic enucleation of the left eye was performed and histopathologic examination demonstrated the presence of a presumed metastatic spindle cell sarcoma. Further immunohistochemical staining confirmed the intraocular neoplasia to be metastatic spread from the previously removed flank mass. Rapid progression in size and number of chorioretinal lesions in the right eye was noted in the post-operative period until the patient was euthanized one month after surgery. This case report is the first to document intraocular metastasis of hemangiopericytoma in a veterinary patient.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physical examination findings were consistent with cranial abdominal masses and anemia. Abdominal imaging revealed soft tissue opacity masses in the cranial abdomen and hypoechoic cysts arising from the liver parenchyma. Conservative management failed to improve clinical signs, and a midline exploratory laparotomy was performed. Three large hemorrhagic cysts were visualized occupying a significant amount of the liver parenchyma. The cysts were drained, omentalized and partially closed with a surgical stapler and suture. Histopatological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a chronic hepatic hematoma. The patient recovered well and was discharged 3 days postoperatively. Two years later, the patient was readmitted with the same clinical signs and large multiple hepatic cysts involving most of the liver lobes. These were surgically omentalized similarly to the previous surgery and the patient recovered well postoperatively. Two years later, return to normal life and no recurrence of the cysts was reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Argentina, the species most abundant widely distributed is Salvator merianae. Particularly in Santa Fe province, the area occupied by populations of these lizards overlaps with areas where agriculture was extended. With the aim of established baseline values for four immunologic biomarkers widely used, 36 tegu lizards were evaluated tacking into account different age classes and both sexes. Total leukocyte counts were not different between age classes. Of the leucocytes count, eosinophils levels were higher in neonates compared with juvenile and adults; nevertheless, the heterophils group was the most prevalent leukocyte in the peripheral blood in all age classes. Lymphocytes, monocytes, heterophils, azurophils and basophils levels did not differ with age. Natural antibodies titres were higher in the adults compared with neonates and juveniles lizards. Lastly, complement system activity was low in neonates compared with juveniles and adults. Statistical analysis within each age group showed that gender was not a factor in the outcomes. Based on the results, we concluded that S. merianae demonstrated age (but not gender) related differences in the immune parameters analyzed. Having established baseline values for these four widely-used immunologic biomarkers, ongoing studies will seek to optimize the use of the S. merianae model in future research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One of the major difficulties in studying camel cellular immunity consists in the lack of mAbs that dtect their leukocyte differentiation antigens. In the present study two-parameter flow cytometry was used to screen existing commercially available mAbs to human leukocyte antigens and major histocompatibility molecules (MHC) for their reactivity with camel leukocytes. The comparison of patterns of reactivity obtained after labelling human and camel leukocytes have shown that mAbs specific to human cluster of differentiation (CD) 18, CD11a, CD11b and CD14 are predicted to be cross-reactive with homologous camel antigens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In most of the situations, innate responses get induced and enhanced after the pathogen invasion. It would be interesting to look into the inducibility of various innate immune mechanisms and the level of enhancement after infection with the pathogen. Hence, in the present investigation, modulation of the innate immune responses in the striped snakehead murrel, Channa striata on experimental challenge with either live virulent or heat killed Aeromonas hydrophila at a dose of 1x10[7] CFU (suspended in 0.2 mL PBS) were measured. Most of the non-specific (both humoral and cellular) immune responses tested were substantially induced or enhanced in both the experimental groups in comparison with the unchallenged control group. Significant increase in the lysozyme, total peroxidase, antiprotease and respiratory burst activities were observed after the pathogen challenge. Thus, most of the innate non-specific immune responses are inducible though they are constitutive of fish immune system exhibiting a basal level of activity even in the absence of pathogen challenge.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These studies remarks that in addition to rats, other animals like cats, opossums and dogs could be implied in the transmission of Rickettsia typhi as infected fleas obtained from serologically positive animals have been detected in samples from endemic areas. In Mexico, the higher number of murine typhus cases have been detected in the Yucatan peninsula, which includes a great southeastern region of Mexico that shows ecologic characteristics similar to the sub-urban alternative cycle recently described in Texas and California at the United States. To find out which are the particular ecologic characteristics of murine typhus transmission in this region, we analyzed blood and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks obtained from domestic dogs by molecular approaches, demonstrating that both samples were infected by Rickettsia typhi. Following this, we obtained isolates that were analyzed by genetic sequencing to corroborate this infection in 100% of the analyzed samples. This evidence suggests for the first time that ticks and dogs could be actively participating in the transmission of murine typhus, in a role that requires further studies for its precise description.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For the first time, this study describes a median lifespan using the data of 232 dogs of the Cane Corso Italiano breed collected from kennels and individual owners from 25 countries. The median lifespan of the whole examined group is 9.29 years (IQR 6.98-11.12, IQR = Interquartile Range). This paper is the first to describe the possible relationship between median lifespan and hair colour within one breed. The longest living group is formed by black brindle coloured dogs, with a median of 10.30 years (IQR 8.33-13.00), and brindle coloured dogs, with a median of 10.13 years (IQR 7.12-11.25). The median lifespan of black brindle dogs exceeded the overall median lifespan of all dogs by 1.01 year and the median lifespan of other colour dogs by 2.21 years. Our results suggest a possible way for a prolongation of age at death of the Cane Corso Italiano breed using appropriate breeding. The median lifespan of male Cane Corso Italiano dogs is 9.25 years (IQR 6.97-11.00) and female Cane Corso Italiano dogs 9.33 years (IQR 7.00-11.31). The statistical analysis using the Independent Samples Student's t test confirmed that the lifespan of female dogs did not exceed the median lifespan of male dogs (P&gt;0.01).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Tropomyosin (TPM), a coiled-coil dimeric protein, is a component of thin filament in striated muscles. In mammals, four TPM genes (TPM1, TPM2, TPM3, and TPM4) generate a multitude of TPM isoforms via alternate splicing and/or using different promoters. Unfortunately, our knowledge of TPM isoform diversity in the horse is very limited. Hence, we undertook a comprehensive exploratory study of various TPM isoforms from horse heart and skeletal muscle. We have cloned and sequenced two sarcomeric isoforms of the TPM1 gene called TPM1&#945; and TPM1&#954;, one sarcomeric isoform of the TPM2 and one of the TPM3 gene, TPM2&#945; and TPM3&#945; respectively. By qRT-PCR using both relative expression and copy number, we have shown that TPM1&#945; expression compared to TPM1&#954; is very high in heart. On the other hand, the expression of TPM1&#945; is higher in skeletal muscle compared to heart. Further, the expression of TPM2&#945; and TPM3&#945; are higher in skeletal muscle compared to heart. Using western blot analyses with CH1 monoclonal antibody we have shown the high expression levels of sarcomeric TPM proteins in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Due to the paucity of isoform specific antibodies we cannot specifically detect the expression of TPM1&#954; in horse striated muscle. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first report on the characterization of sarcmeric TPMs in horse striated muscle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This lesion had been twice surgically treated as a canker but rapidly recurred. Histological examination of the second excision revealed a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. At presentation, the horse was mildly depressed, lame and partially non-weight-bearing on the right hind leg, which exhibited a 10 x 10 cm erosive and proliferative lesion remodeling the hoof. After completing staging procedures, the lesion was approached with surgery and intraoperative electrochemotherapy (ECT) administration of bleomycin in isolated limb perfusion. A second session of surgery and ECT was performed one month later, followed by three additional monthly sessions of ECT. During periodic recheck, the mare showed continuous improvement. One year after presentation, the mare was in complete remission and her gait markedly improved. ECT was well-tolerated and resulted in improved local control of a tumor in a challenging anatomical district.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The dog had a malignant pilomatricoma removed from the left lateral thigh 6 months earlier. Histopathology review of the cutaneous and scapular mass identified the same tumour type, confirming metastatic disease; additional metastases to the inguinal lymph node, liver and lungs were identified. Chemotherapy resulted in partial responses/stable disease of very short duration. Bisphosphonates were administered due to lack of a measurable response and worsening of the associated lameness. The patient ultimately developed a symptomatic vertebral metastasis and was euthanased. The dog survived 255 days since medical treatment was started and 455 days since surgical removal of the primary tumour. This case report suggests that medical treatment with the addition of analgesia may be able to palliate clinical signs and possibly extend survival in dogs with metastatic epithelial cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study is to present the clinical, radiological and pathological findings of a primary renal tumor in the cat. Grossly, the mass mostly encapsulated the kidney. Histologically, excisional biopsy showed worrying histological features. A sarcoma-like tumor composed mainly of neoplastic spindle-shaped cells. Neoplastic nodules of aggregations of fusiform cells arranged in multidirectional bundles. Immunohistochemically, several immunohistochemical satins (melan-A, S-100, vimentin, actin, desmin, cytokeratin, neurofilament, melan-A, NSE, synaptophysin, chromogranin, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein GFAP, Collagen IV and CD99) were used to differentially diagnose the mass. The stained neoplastic sections positively tested to S-100, but negative to the other aforementioned immunohistochemical stains. Immunohistochemistry with S-100 antibody staining showed an unusually strong positive reaction throughout the tumor cells. Based on our comparative diagnosis relative to other tumors, in addition to the progressive clinical signs, histopathological and immunohistochemical results, this case was presumptively diagnosis as a malignant schwannoma. According to our investigation of the relevant literature, this study of malignant renal Schwannoma (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) is a highly rare case not previously characterized in a cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Healthy elbow joints exhibited a relative radio-ulnar translation of 0.7 mm (SD 0.31 mm), while dysplastic joints showed a translation of 0.5 mm (SD 0.30 mm). No significant difference between groups was detected (p = 0.2092, confidence interval -0.6 - 0.2). Based on these findings dRUI is present in every canine elbow joint, as part of the physiological kinematic pattern. However, dysplastic elbow joints do not show an increased radio-ulnar translation, and therfore dRUI cannot be considered causative for medial coronoid disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 7-month-old, mixed breed, male dog suffered the sudden-onset of unilateral painful exophthalmos and a gradual swelling of the right temporal region. A compressing, right retrobulbar mass was observed by ultrasound. Computed tomography revealed a large multiloculated cyst-like lesion of the right zygomatic gland projecting into the orbital space, thus displacing the eyeball. The ipsilateral molar part of the maxillary bone was underdeveloped, besides showing crowded, abnormal, multiple, unerupted maxillary molar teeth in the caudal maxillary region. Modified lateral orbitotomy and a selective caudal maxillary bone access were performed. The cyst-like lesion was removed and the zygomatic gland and the wall was collected for histology, which confirmed the mucocele. Clinical and imaging examinations six months after surgery showed neither recurrence of the mucocele nor ocular abnormalities. A possible common pathogenic mechanism involving these two conditions could be hypothesized.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

CT scan performed elsewhere had revealed the presence of an unencapsulated nodular mass (3x1x5 cm) dorsal to the larynx and first tracheal rings. Laryngoscopy demonstrated the presence of bilateral laryngeal paralysis and distorted laryngeal architecture suggestive of extraluminal compression. Histopathology results of incisional biopsies from the mass were suggestive of a benign non-neoplastic muscular lesion. Surgery was performed to manage laryngeal paralysis and attempt mass excision. A second histopathology examination confirmed an inflammatory and dysplastic lesion suggestive of a pseudotumour. All clinical signs resolved after surgery and at the 13 months follow-up the dog remains asymptomatic. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a case of laryngeal paralysis caused by a muscle pseudotumour in a young dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed to evaluate two methods for DNA recovery from animal tissues (livers, muscles), focusing on the best storage temperature for DNA yield in term of quality, quantity, and integrity for use in several downstream molecular techniques. Six male Swiss albino mice were sacrificed, liver and muscle tissues (n=32) were then harvested and stored for one week in different temperatures, -20&#176;C, 4&#176;C, 25&#176;C and 40&#176;C. The conditioned animal tissues were used for DNA extraction by Chelex-100 method or NucleoSpinC Blood and Tissue kit. The extracted gDNA was visualized on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the quality of gDNA and analysed spectrophotometrically to determine the DNA concentration and the purity. Both methods, Chelex-100 and NucleoSpin Blood and Tissue kit found to be appropriate for yielding high quantity of gDNA, with the Chelex 100 method yielding a greater quantity (P &lt; 0.045) than the kit. At -20&#176;C, 4&#176;C, and 25&#176;C temperatures, the concentration of DNA yield was numerically lower than at 40&#176;C. The NucleoSpinC Blood and Tissue kit produced a higher (P=0.031) purity product than the Chelex-100 method, particularly for muscle tissues. The Chelex-100 method is cheap, fast, effective, and is a crucial tool for yielding DNA from animal tissues (livers, muscles) exposed to harsh environment with little limitations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28884077</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Environmentally toxicant exposures induced intragenerational transmission of liver abnormalities in mice.</Title>	<Abstract>Environmental toxicants such as chemicals, heavy metals, and pesticides have been shown to promote transgenerational inheritance of abnormal phenotypes and/or diseases to multiple subsequent generations following parental and/or ancestral exposures. This study was designed to examine the potential transgenerational action of the environmental toxicant trichloroethane (TCE) on transmission of liver abnormality, and to elucidate the molecular etiology of hepatocyte cell damage. A total of thirty two healthy immature female albino mice were randomly divided into three equal groups as follows: a sham group, which did not receive any treatment; a vehicle group, which received corn oil alone, and TCE treated group (3 weeks, 100 &#956;g/kg i.p., every 4[th] day). The F0 and F1 generation control and TCE populations were sacrificed at the age of four months, and various abnormalities histpathologically investigated. Cell death and oxidative stress indices were also measured. The present study provides experimental evidence for the inheritance of environmentally induced liver abnormalities in mice. The results of this study show that exposure to the TCE promoted adult onset liver abnormalities in F0 female mice as well as unexposed F1 generation offspring. It is the first study to report a transgenerational liver abnormalities in the F1 generation mice through maternal line prior to gestation. This finding was based on careful evaluation of liver histopathological abnormalities, apoptosis of hepatocytes, and measurements of oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and nitric oxide) in control and TCE populations. There was an increase in liver histopathological abnormalities, cell death, and oxidative lipid damage in F0 and F1 hepatic tissues of TCE treated group. In conclusion, this study showed that the biological and health impacts of environmental toxicant TCE do not end in maternal adults, but are passed on to offspring generations. Hence, linking observed liver abnormality in the offspring to environmental exposure of their parental line. This study also illustrated that oxidative stress and apoptosis appear to be a molecular component of the hepatocyte cell injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Six healthy mixed breed dogs from the same litter were used in two different stages. First, one drop of flurbiprofen sodium 0.03% and diclofenac sodium 0.1% in each eye; second, one drop of ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% and benzalkonium chloride 0.01% in each eye. Baseline esthesiometry was obtained before eye drop application and every 15 minutes thereafter until a total of 105 minutes of evaluation time. A one-week interval was allowed between the two treatment phases. Statistical analysis was used to compare means according to time of evaluation and drug used. Diclofenac sodium 0.1% decreased corneal sensitivity at 75 and 90 minutes (P &gt; 0.015) with possible interference on neuronal nociceptive activity and analgesic effect while ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% did not show any variation for esthesiometry means along the evaluation. Flurbiprofen sodium 0.03% resulted in increased esthesiometry values 30 minutes after instillation (P &gt; 0.013), increasing corneal sensitivity and possibly producing a greater irritant corneal effect over its analgesic properties. Benzalkonium chloride 0.01% significantly increased corneal sensitivity at 15 minutes of evaluation (P &gt; 0.001), most likely resulting from its irritating effect. Esthesiometry did not allow a definite conclusion over the analgesic effect of the NSAIDs tested; however it was effective in detecting fluctuations in corneal sensitivity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Three hundred animals varying in age from 2 months to 5 years were examined, 147 being male and 153 female. All animals were evaluated with direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp biomicroscopy in animals where lesions were detected. Tonometry using the Tonovet rebound tonometer was undertaken in selected animals as was assessment of tear production using the Schirmer I tear test. Four animals were affected by orbital infection, 3 were anophthalmic, 2 unilaterally and one bilaterally, 3 by conjunctivitis, 3 by non-ulcerative keratitis and 4 by uveitis with corneal oedema. Fifty seven animals were affected by cataract, 54 with bilateral nuclear lens opacities. Twenty six of these animals were young animals considered too small to hibernate. This report documents the first prospective study of ocular disease in the European hedgehog. The predominant finding was bilateral nuclear cataract seen particularly in young poorly growing animals. Investigation into the potential causation of cataracts by poor nutrition or poor feeding ability by lens opacification requires further study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty dogs with KCS and 50 control dogs with normal tear film were evaluated with a full ophthalmoscopic examination and a Schirmer tear test type 1 (STT) determined before tear samples were obtained from the medial canthus with a microhaematocrit capillary tube. 10ul of tear was placed on a microscope slide and the time to first formation of a fern of crystallised tear solute was determined. The appearance of the ferning pattern was graded and correlated with the STT value. All eyes with KCS had abnormal ferning patterns while 39 out of the 50 normal dogs (78%) had so-called 'normal' ferning patterns. The mean STT for dogs showing 'normal' ferning patterns was 20.6mm/min for the left eye and 21.3mm/min for the right eye. STT values for eyes with 'abnormal' ferning patterns were 10.9mm/min and 12.4mm/min, these differing from the normal eyes with STT above 15mm/min significantly. These findings suggest that tear ferning could be a valuable technique for assessment of the tear film in dogs with KCS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pulmonary ossification appeared grossly as irregular stony sharp particles which infiltrated the lung tissue and were readily recognizable from under the pleura as grayish sharp protruding particles. Microscopic examination revealed the existence of intra-alveolar single or multilobular particles of ossification which are formed of lamellated osseous substance with osteocytes in lacunae. Microlith particles were also seen and were smaller, usually solitary and less frequent. They comprised strongly basophilic smooth laminated spherical particles which may enclose faintly stained substances. Both structures were not associated with inflammatory response. Larger particles appeared as white miliary spots by radiography.

Twenty-eight New Zealand rabbits were used in this study. Seven animals were allocated to the C group (negative control), and KCS was induced in 21 animals by topically applying 1% atropine sulfate drops for 7 days. Treatment with atropine was maintained throughout the study period (12 weeks). The rabbits were divided into 3 treatment groups containing 7 animals each: FO group, LO group and FLO group (FO and LO). The animals were evaluated using the Schirmer Tear Test I (STT I), Rose Bengal Test (RBT), fluorescein test (FT), tear film break-up time (TBUT), and conjunctival and histopathological analysis. There was a significant increase in STT I and TBUT values in treatment groups, but the increase occurred earlier in the FO group. The results of the RBT and FT were similar among treatment groups, except FT, in the FLO group, negative staining was only in 12 weeks. There was a significant decrease in the number of goblet cells in the FLO group compared with the other groups. The results demonstrated that orally administered of FO and LO improved the clinical signs of KCS. However, improvement occurred earlier in the FO group. Using oils in combination did not provide additional benefits. These results contribute to the future development of new oral formulations as adjuvant therapies for KCS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Upon presentation the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive, and mildly hypothermic. Abdominal palpation revealed an approximately 2-cm long oblong mass within the caudal abdomen. Abdominal radiographs revealed gastric dilation without volvulus and a peritoneal mass effect. The patient was euthanized following gastric reflux of brown malodorous fluid from his nares and oral cavity. A necropsy was performed and revealed a jejuno-jejunal intussusception causing mechanical gastrointestinal ileus, and gastric dilatation without volvulus. While non-obstructive gastrointestinal stasis is common and obstructive ileus is uncommon in guinea pigs, this report shows that intestinal intussusception is a differential in guinea pigs with ileus and gastric dilatation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An 11-year-old cat was presented with lethargy, weight loss and polyuria/polydipsia. An abdominal mass was detected upon physical examination. Clinicopathological work-up revealed marked erythrocytosis (HCT value 64.8%), renal azotemia and decreased urine specific gravity (USG). An abdominal ultrasound was performed, localizing the mass in the right kidney. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) was above the reference interval (RI), and the cytology of the mass was indicative of renal carcinoma. Manual erythrocytapheresis was performed in order to stabilize the patient before surgery, improving the cat's clinical and clinicopathological condition. After nephrectomy, EPO and creatinine concentrations returned within the RI, while the USG markedly increased. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of renal adenocarcinoma.

An adult zoo-bred female was found collapsed, and died despite supportive treatment. Hematology and biochemistry showed pancytopenia and hyperglobulinemia, and serum protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal band in the &#946;-globulin region. Necropsy demonstrated hemoabdomen, multifocal lytic bone marrow lesions, splenomegaly, and hemorrhagic hepatic nodules, with left medial lobe rupture. There were mutifocal hemorrhages in the subcutis, lung, epicardium, and intestinal mucosa. Histopathology demonstrated plasmacytoid cells infiltrating the bone marrow, liver and spleen, and circulating within blood vessels. On immunohistochemistry, cell infiltrates of the three tissues were positive for &#955; light chains, bone marrow infiltrates were positive for MUM-1 and bone marrow and spleen infiltrates were positive for CD20. These findings indicate that this animal died of hemoabdomen subsequent to multiple myeloma.

Depending on the anatomical region involved, three forms of concussive syndromes are described: brain concussion, spinal concussion and cerebellar concussion. Although major textbooks of veterinary neurology admit the existence of canine brain concussion, spontaneous cases of this pathological condition have not been reported in small animals so far. This report describes two cases of concussion in dogs: a 9-month-old, intact male, shih-tzu with brain concussion; and a 10-month-old, intact male, poodle with cerebellar concussion. In addition, a brief review of the definition of the term "concussion" in the veterinary medical literature is provided, in comparison to its meaning in the human medical literature. Finally, this paper proposes an appropriate definition of "concussion" in dogs, that may facilitate clinicians in the recognition of such an elusive syndrome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of Clostridium perfringens in sausages sold in Meknes city (Morocco) and to study the different factors affecting it contamination with this bacterium. To this end, 156 samples of sausages were taken in various shopping sites during one year from March 2014 to February 2015. The microbiological analysis was carried out using the specific medium for isolation and identification of C. perfringens. ANOVA test was used for Statistical analysis (p&lt; 0.05). The results of this study showed the presence of C. perfringens in 77.56% (121 of 156) samples, with 88.88% (32 of 36) in street vendors, 79.16% (19 of 24) in a weekly market, 70.83% (51 of 72) in butchery and 62.5% (15 of 24) in a supermarket. The average rate was 2.42 Log CFU/g, with a minimum value of 0 CFU/g recorded in several outlets and a maximum value of 6.05 Log CFU/g recorded in butchery. This study reveals that the contamination rate of sausages with C. perfringens is related to the sausages origin, retail sites and seasonal variations related to temperature increase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In small dogs, it is difficult to repair multiple lesions in both leaflets using MVP. Herein, we report a case of severe mitral regurgitation caused by multiple severe lesions in the posterior leaflet (PL) in a mixed Chihuahua. Initially, we had planned MVR with an artificial valve. However, MVP combined with artificial chordal reconstruction of both leaflets, semicircular suture annuloplasty, and valvuloplasty using a newly devised direct scallop suture for the PL was attempted in this dog. The dog recovered well and showed no adverse cardiac signs, surviving two major operations. The dog died 4 years and 10 months after the MVP due to non-cardiovascular disease. Our additional technique of using a direct scallop suture seemed useful for PL repair involving multiple scallops in a small dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A study was conducted to investigate a change in the thermal pattern and temperature of the thermal image of the paw print in a lame pelvic limb compared to a non-lame pelvic limb of dogs confirmed by orthostatic analysis. Fourteen client owned dogs with a unilateral pelvic limb lameness and 14 healthy employee dogs were examined and the pelvic limbs radiographed. Thermal images of the paw print were taken after each dog was kept in a static position on a foam mat for 30 seconds. Average temperatures and thermographic patterns were analyzed. Analysis was performed in a static position. The asymmetry index for each stance variable and optimal cutoff point for the peak vertical force and thermal image temperatures were calculated. Image pattern analysis revealed 88% success in differentiating the lame group, and 100% in identifying the same thermal pattern in the healthy group. The mean of the peak vertical force revealed a 10.0% difference between the left and right pelvic limb in healthy dogs and a 72.4% between the lame and non-lame limb in the lame dog group. Asymmetry index analysis revealed 5% in the healthy group and 36.2% in the lame group. The optimal cutoff point for the peak vertical force to determine lameness was 41.77% (AUC = 0.93) and for MII 0.943% (AUC = 0.72). The results of this study highlight the change in the thermal pattern of the paw print in the lame pelvic limb compared to a non-lame pelvic limb in the lame group and the healthy group. Medical infrared imaging of the paw prints can be utilized to screen for the lame limb in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Records of client-owned dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia at a referral centre were retrospectively reviewed. Only dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia based on the presence of a right-sided heart murmur identified prior to one year of age, and confirmed with Doppler echocardiography, were included. Dogs with concomitant cardiac diseases, pulmonary hypertension and/or trivial tricuspid regurgitation were excluded. Analysed data included signalment, reason for presentation, clinical signs, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features, survival status and cause of death. Survival times and risk factors for mortality were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Eighteen dogs met inclusion criteria. Border collies were over-represented (p= 0.014). Dogs were most frequently referred for investigation of heart murmur. The most common arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation (n=3). Median survival time from diagnosis of tricuspid valve dysplasia was 2775 days (range 1-3696 days; 95% CI 1542.41-4007.59) and from onset of right-sided congestive heart failure was 181 days (range 1-2130 days; 95% CI 0-455.59). Syncope was the sole risk factor for cardiac death. In this population of UK dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia was uncommon but, when severe, frequently led to right-sided congestive heart failure. Prognosis was favourable for mild and moderate tricuspid dysplasia. Survival time was reduced with right-sided congestive heart failure but varied widely. Risk of cardiac death was significantly increased if syncope had occurred.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29296596</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Investigation of manganese homeostasis in dogs with anaemia and chronic enteropathy.</Title>	<Abstract>Lethargy is a frequent and important clinical feature of anaemia; however, it does not absolutely correlate with the severity of anaemia. Manganese is efficiently absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which is also responsible for iron transport. DMT1 is upregulated in iron deficiency (ID). Increased manganese concentrations are reported in ID anaemia (IDA) in various species. Manganese is neurotoxic and therefore may contribute to lethargy observed in some anaemic patients. In addition, anaemia and ID are common in human inflammatory bowel disease. Little is known about how anaemia influences manganese metabolism in veterinary patients and how common is anaemia in dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE). If elevated manganese concentrations are found, then potentially neurotoxicity may be contributing to morbidity in these cases. The objectives of this study were to investigate the hypothesis that whole blood manganese concentrations would be increased in dogs with anaemia, particularly in dogs with confirmed IDA, and that anaemia would be common in canine CE. Medical records from 2012-2016 were reviewed for dogs with CE that were anaemic, as well as dogs with confirmed IDA, where a sample suitable for manganese analysis was held in an archive. Manganese concentration was measured in whole blood from: 11 anaemic dogs with CE, 6 dogs with IDA, 9 non-anaemic ill controls, and 12 healthy controls. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests with post-test Dunn's multiple comparisons tests were performed, with P&lt;0.05 considered significant. The prevalence of anaemia in canine CE was 20.6% (33/160). Manganese concentrations were significantly different between all groups (P=0.0001) and higher in non-anaemic than anaemic dogs (P=0.0078). Manganese concentrations were also higher in healthy compared to ill controls (P&lt;0.0001), anaemic dogs with CE (P=0.0056) and to dogs with IDA (P=0.0001). No differences were observed between anaemic dogs with CE, IDA and ill controls. Although anaemia was frequently observed in canine CE, the hypothesis that dogs with anaemia would have increased manganese concentrations, possibly contributing to a lethargic state was not supported. Further research is warranted to understand the influence of anaemia on whole blood manganese.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Mg[2+] is also involved in blood pressure regulation, maintenance of body temperature, and glucose metabolism. Although various factors including foods and physical conditions have been reported to change serum Mg[2+] status in humans, serum Mg[2+] in dogs exposed to external stress has been unclear. In this study, we examined serum levels of Mg[2+] in dogs at different conditions using the guide dog candidates for the blind. Serum Mg[2+] was decreased in winter and increased in summer. Guide dog candidates in an elementary class of the training showed markedly lower levels of serum Mg[2+], compared with that of dogs in an advanced class. When healthy adult dogs were subjected to forced exercise using a treadmill, a significant reduction in serum Mg[2+] levels was observed, particularly in winter. These findings suggest that serum levels of Mg[2+] may be influenced by weather fluctuation such as air temperature, nervousness in unaccustomed situations, age, and physical stress induced by exercise. The results indicate that Mg[2+] supplementation should be considered for working dogs, dogs moving or traveling to a new environment, and dogs during winter.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29392117</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Long-term follow-up of surgical resection alone for primary intracranial rostrotentorial tumors in dogs: 29 cases (2002-2013).</Title>	<Abstract>Intracranial neoplasia is frequently encountered in dogs. After a presumptive diagnosis of intracranial neoplasia is established based on history, clinical signs and advanced imaging characteristics, the decision to treat and which treatment to choose must be considered. The objective of this study is to report survival times (ST) for dogs with intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with surgical resection alone (SRA), to identify potential prognostic factors affecting survival, and to compare the results with the available literature. Medical records of 29 dogs with histopathologic confirmation of intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with SRA were retrospectively reviewed. For each dog, signalment, clinical signs, imaging findings, type of surgery, treatment, histological evaluation, and ST were obtained. Twenty-nine dogs with a histological diagnosis who survived &gt;7 days after surgery were included. There were 15 (52%) meningiomas and 14 (48%) gliomas. All tumors had a rostrotentorial location. At the time of the statistical analysis, only two dogs were alive. Median ST for meningiomas was 422 days (mean, 731 days; range, 10-2735 days). Median ST for gliomas was 66 days (mean, 117 days; range, 10-730 days). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that ST was significantly longer for meningiomas than for gliomas (P&lt;0.05). A negative correlation between the presence of a midline shift and ST (P=0.037) and ventricular compression and ST (P=0.038) was observed for meningiomas. For gliomas, there were no significant associations between ST and any of the variables evaluated. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that, for dogs that survived &gt;7 days postoperatively, SRA might be an appropriate treatment, particularly for meningiomas, when radiation therapy is not readily available. Also, the presence of midline shift and ventricular compression might be negative prognostic factors for dogs with meningiomas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To demonstrate these concepts, the analytical approach adopted for an alpine ibex (Capra ibex) found dead in a mountain area of North Western Italy was described. The animal showed sub-costal and lymph nodes collections of green-yellow pus, fibrinous pleuropneumonia and catarrhal-hemorrhagic enteritis. Purulent process was ascribed to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the causative agent of caseous lymphadenitis or pseudotuberculosis, pleuropneumonia to Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica and enteritis to Mannheimia haemolytica. Parasitic bronchopneumonia in the caudal lobes of the lung, a severe enteric infestation by gastro-intestinal and pulmonary strongyles and coccidia were found. The cause of death in the studied ibex appeared to be a consequence of an association between various pathological processes, with bacteriological and parasitic etiology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Blood samples were taken from 20 camels. 5ml of blood was collected from the jugular vein and serum was separated from samples by centrifugation. Capillary electrophoresis of serum proteins identified six protein fractions in adult camels, including albumin, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2 and gamma globulins, serum levels of these parameters were 3.9&#177;0.04 g/dl, 0.16&#177;0.01 g/dl, 0.39&#177;0.03 g/dl, 0.515&#177;0.03 g/dl, 0.205&#177;0.01 g/dl and 0.61&#177;0.04 g/dl, and 65.42&#177;0.62 g/l, respectively. The total protein concentration was 65.42&#177;0.62 g/L, while, the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio was 2.4&#177;0.14. The present study indicates six peaks with minicapillary electrophoresis and the results obtained were compared and interpreted in the light of finding reported by other investigators in camels.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To ensure the health of the horse and to prevent the possibility of lameness, it has been a common practice to apply cold therapy to the distal limb of the horse pre- and post-exercise. Commercially available boots are widely available for the application of cold therapy. To test the effectiveness of the boot, 6 healthy performance level sport type horses were exercised at a walk, trot, and canter in a round-pen and then subjected to the application of the ice boot for 20 minutes on a treatment leg, and no ice boot on an untreated leg. Thermal images were taken of the 3[rd] metacarpal region pre-exercise, post-exercise, post-ice boot, and every 2 minutes after until the difference between the temperatures of the control leg and the treatment leg became zero. The images were analyzed using an analysis software (FLIR Tools) to determine the average temperature of the 3[rd] metacarpal region at each time point. The measured temperatures between treatments were found to be significantly different due to the application of the ice boot, providing evidence that the boot sufficiently cools the leg (P&lt;.01). Thereafter, a 95% confidence interval was created to depict the average time it took for the cooled leg to return to average temperature post-ice boot, suggesting that it takes about 14.67 minutes for the difference between the temperatures of the cooled leg versus the non-cooled leg to become zero. This finding is significant to horse owners, trainers, and veterinarians that use this commonly available tool. These findings lend evidence to support the common practice of using cold therapy in treatment of disease in the horse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A one-year-old Ouled Djellal sheep from a large herd (~1240 animals), located in Bordj Bou Arreridj, Algeria, was clinically diagnosed by the presence of persistent seromucous nasal discharge, head shaking, muzzle licking, dyspnoea, exophthalmia and frontal protrusion. The sheep was euthanized, and the necropsy was performed. Gross examination showed soft touch, pinkish-white tumour masses in the nasal cavities with distortion of the turbinates and of the medium septum. According to clinical and pathological findings, the tumour has been defined as a low grade mixed nasal adenocarcinoma, with the presence of tubular and papillary structures. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of ENA in Algeria known to be associated with enzootic nasal tumour virus (ENTV) infection. However, such association requires confirmation by direct and/or indirect viral investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although the diverse range of clinical manifestations of the leptospirosis in humans is widely documented, the mechanisms through which the pathogen causes disease remain undetermined. In addition, leptospirosis is a much-neglected life-threatening disease although it is one of the most important zoonoses occurring in a diverse range of epidemiological distribution. Recent advances in molecular profiling of pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira have improved our understanding of the evolutionary factors that determine virulence and mechanisms that the bacteria employ to survive. However, a major impediment to the formulation of intervention strategies has been the limited understanding of the disease determinants. Consequently, the association of the biological mechanisms to the pathogenesis of Leptospira, as well as the functions of numerous essential virulence factors still remain implicit. This review examines recent advances in genetic screening technologies, the underlying microbiological processes, the virulence factors and associated molecular mechanisms driving pathogenesis of Leptospira species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Managing the condition has been very challenging and re-occurrence has been reported with moderate to high morbidity and mortality. The incidence and biochemical features of cattle with dermatophilosis was conducted in June to December 2016 across the four geopolitical zones of Oyo state, Nigeria. Clinical diagnosis were made based on appearance of dermatophilosis lesion, breeds morphologically characterized, ageing were based on rostral dentition and severity based on the extent and nature of the lesion. Biochemical analysis was based on standard procedure as prescribed by Fortress International. Fifty cattle were found to be infected with clinical dermatophilosis during the period of the study. Twenty four (48%) in Ibadan zone, 14 (28%) in Oyo/Ogbomosho, 8 (16%) in Oke-ogun and 4 (8%) in Ibarapa zone. Breeds distribution across the zones showed 28 (56%) White Fulani, 5 (10%) Sokoto Gudali, 3 (6%) Adamawa Gudali, 7 (14%) Red Bororo, 5 (10%) Cross breeds while the Kuri was 2 (4%). Regarding animal ages, less than 2 years old were 2 animals (4%) while the adults were 48 animals (96%) and they fall under the categories of 2-2&#189; years of age, 3-3&#189; years of age and those which are over 3&#189; years of age. The different levels of severity were categorized into mild (20 (40%)), moderate (23 (46%)) and severe (7 (14%)) .The best parameters were seen in White Fulani, while the least were seen in Adamawa Gudali. The age group in the category of 3 - 3&#189; years had most of the best serum values while the least values were seen in animals less than 2 years of age. Cattle exhibiting mild lesions had most of the best serum values and the least values were observed in cattle with severe lesions. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed in the mean values for the various parameters studied among the breeds, age, and severity of condition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The Kabardian horse from Northern Caucasia which is well-known for strength, stamina and endurance in distance riding has a large gap in its breeding documentation especially in the recent past. A 309 bp fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop (156 Kabardian horses) and six mutations in Y chromosome (49 Kabardian stallions), respectively, were analyzed to get a better insight into breeding history, phylogenetic relationship to related breeds, maternal and paternal diversity and genetic structure. We found a high mitochondrial diversity represented by 64 D-loop haplotypes out of 14 haplogroups. The most frequent haplogroups were G (19.5%), L (12.3%), Q (11.7%), and B (11.0%). Although these four haplogroups are also frequently found in Asian riding horses (e.g. Buryat, Kirghiz, Mongolian, Transbaikalian, Tuvinian) the percentage of the particular haplogroups varies sometimes remarkable. In contrast, the obtained haplogroup pattern from Kabardian horse was more similar to that of breeds reared in the Middle East. No specific haplotype cluster was observed in the phylogenetic tree for Kabardian horses. On Kabardian Y chromosome, two mutations were found leading to three haplotypes with a percentage of 36.7% (haplotype HT1), 38.8% (haplotype HT2) and 24.5% (haplotype HT3), respectively. The high mitochondrial and also remarkable paternal diversity of the Kabardian horse is caused by its long history with a widely spread maternal origin and the introduction of Arabian as well as Thoroughbred influenced stallions for improvement. This high genetic diversity provides a good situation for the ongoing breed development and performance selection as well as avoiding inbreeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Yet to date no direct evaluation has been made of the inflammatory cell populations in the lacrimal tissue of dogs with iKCS. Here we sought to quantify T and B lymphocyte populations in the lacrimal tissue of the nictitans glands of dogs with iKCS those with neurological KCS (nKCS)and also in dogs with tear production within the recognized normal levels and no ocular surface signs of KCS. Nictitans glands were obtained from 10 healthy dogs with no signs or history consistent with KCS at post-mortem or after enucleation. Nictitans glands were also obtained at parotid duct transposition surgery from ten dogs with idiopathic KCS and three with neurogenic KCS. Histological sections form the lacrimal tissue were processed immunohistochemically with primary monoclonal antibodies recognizing the T lymphocyte CD3 antigen and the B lymphocyte CD79a antigen. Cell numbers were counted in 10 randomly sampled representative high-power fields in five sections. Statistical significance of differences in cell numbers was determined using analysis of variance with significance achieved at p=0.05.Nictitans glands from dogs with iKCS showed elevated numbers of T and B lymphocytes compared with those from dogs with normal tear production. The increase in the T cell population was highly statistically significant (p=0.0025) while the increase in B cells, while statistically significant was less pronouncedly so (p=0.049). T and B lymphocyte numbers were not significantly elevated in nictitans glands from dogs with neurogenic KCS compared with those in dogs with normal tear production. The elevation in the T cell population seen in dogs with idiopathic KCS strongly supports the widely held assumption that this disease is an immune-mediated and probably autoimmune. The lack of increase in T cell populations in dogs with nKCS strongly suggests that the changes in iKCS are causing the tear deficiency and not resulting from it.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten horse distal front limbs from horses free of PAL disease were prepared for tenoscopy of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS). A dual-port endoscopic desmotomy with a hook knife was performed in 5 specimens (Group A) and single port Arthrex-Centerline&#8482; Desmotomy was performed in another 5 specimens (Group B). The performing time, judgments of the surgeon, number of blade passages, and gross anatomy were evaluated. The performing time and surgeon judgments were significantly lower in Group B. No significant differences were assessed in number of passages to achieve a complete PAL resection and a gross anatomy evaluation. The use of Arthrex-Centerline&#8482; is feasible for a PAL desmotomy procedure. It was faster with more handling ease compared with the free-hand double-portal desmotomy and allowed the same results in terms of number of passages to complete the release evaluated at gross anatomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>29721434</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Physiological parameter values in greyhounds before and after high-intensity exercise.</Title>	<Abstract>Dog sports competitions have greatly expanded. The availability of reference values for each type of activity could help assess fitness accurately. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate (BL) and rectal temperature (RT) are relevant physiological parameters to determine the dogs response to effort. Previous studies in greyhounds have reported the effect of high-intensity exercise on many physiological parameters immediately after completing different racing distances and recovery times. However, there are no studies concerning physiological changes over shorter racing distances. We therefore assessed the effect of sprint exercise on HR, BL and RT in nine greyhounds performing sprint exercise over a 100-m distance chasing a lure. After the exercise, dogs underwent a passive 10-min recovery phase. Before the exercise, immediately after it and at 5 and 10 min during recovery, HR and RT were assessed and blood samples were collected for BL determination. HR, BL and RT values increased significantly after the exercise (P&lt;0.01). Whereas HR returned to pre-exercise values at 10 min during the recovery phase (P&gt;0.1), BL concentration and RT remained increased (P&lt;0.01). The abrupt increase in HR, BL and RT values observed immediately after the exercise indicates the high intensity of the effort performed. Similarly, BL concentration after the exercise exceeded the 4 mmol/L lactate threshold, suggesting a predominant anaerobic metabolism during effort. Although HR returned to pre-exercise values 10 min after the exercise, a more extensive recovery phase would be necessary for a total return to resting values, particularly for BL and RT. In greyhounds subjected to high-intensity exercise, HR, BL and RT were reliable physiological parameters to accurately assess the physiological response to effort. The use of sprint exercises over short racing distances could be useful for appropriately monitoring fitness in sporting dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Forty-six client-owned dogs admitted for ophthalmic evaluation at the Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, University of Cambridge were included in the study. IOP readings were taken at a variety of locations and using the tonometer at a number of different angles to the cornea: 1) Perpendicularly at center of the cornea (CC); 2) At the center of the cornea but with the tonometer positioned at four angles, and 3) At four different points on the peripheral cornea. All values were compared with the values recorded at the recommended CC position. IOP values were significantly underestimated in seven positions, with median and interquartile range from 12.1 &#177; 4 mmHg (nasal on periphery) to 15 &#177; 5 mmHg (laterally angled at center), varying between 0 mmHg to 2.9 mmHg from the CC value. While dorsally angled in the central cornea were not significantly different from those at CC (p = 0.09). Median values were lower for measurements in peripheral positions when compared to angled central positions. These results demonstrate that angling the tonometer or measuring in peripheral regions can result in small but statistically significant underestimation of IOP values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the study was to evaluate 11&#946;-HSD1 and eNOS expression in dogs with HAC. Visceral adipose tissue samples were taken to evaluate 11&#946;-HSD1 expression by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.

The excess of circulating cortisol affects different organs and metabolic pathways, producing severe adverse effects that endanger the animal's life. Among these effects, hypertension and renal damage can be mentioned. A group of 20 dogs with pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) and 12 control dogs were used to study the following parameters: cortisol and nitric oxide (NO nit/nit) concentrations, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, renal artery resistance index by Doppler ultrasound, the rate of glomerular filtration by radio-renogram excretion and the presence of proteins in urine. Dogs with PDH showed a significantly lower NO nit/nit (P&lt;0.0001) than the controls and this correlated with high values of diastolic and systolic pressure (r = -0.87; P&lt;0.0001 and r = -0.81; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). Most dogs (80%) are hypertensive mainly due to an increase in diastolic pressure, which correlated positively with the UPC (r = 0.8; P&lt;0.001) and negatively with the glomerular rate of filtration (r = -0.58; P=0.007). Systolic pressure only increased in 60% of the cases and did not correlate with the mentioned variables. In PDH the decrease of NO affects blood pressure. The diastolic pressure would seem to have the greatest impact on the kidneys, therefore its evaluation and control are important to avoid and/or control renal damage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, it is questionable how the individual toe conformation and tendon properties interact with the dorsal metacarpophalangeal joint angle (DMPJ). Data are needed for a tangible evaluation of the equine limb conformation for more specific orthopaedic treatment. The aim was to evaluate the correlation between the DMPJ, toe conformation and cross-sectional area (CSA) of both flexor tendons; the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT). Thirty Warmblood horses were available for the study. Lateromedial radiographs of the toe and fetlock and transverse ultrasound images of both flexor tendons were obtained from three zones. The DMPJ, length and angle of the phalanges and CSA SDFT/DDFT were measured. In addition, hoof angle, wither height, age, and sex were documented. Correlations were calculated using Pearson's test. A paired t-test was used to evaluate left-right differences. Length and angle of the proximal and middle phalanx were significantly associated with the DMPJ (r = -0.28 - -0.45, p&lt;0.001-0.04). Neither the angle of the hoof and distal phalanx nor the CSA SDFT/DDFT, showed a noticeable correlation with the DMPJ. Significant left-right differences occurred for the DMPJ (p&lt;0.002) and the angle of the proximal and middle phalanx (p&lt;0.01 - 0.002). A moderate negative correlation was shown between the DMPJ and wither height (r = - 0.31, p=0.04). Results represent only a specific population. The study provides only a static evaluation of a dynamic situation. In a clinical context, it might be useful to focus on the angulation and length of the pastern to evaluate the individual load affecting the DMPJ and its associated structures. These findings might be relevant for orthopaedic treatments and shoeing recommendations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29721439</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Recent approaches in food bio-preservation - a review.</Title>	<Abstract>Bio-preservation is a technique of extending the shelf life of food by using natural or controlled microbiota or antimicrobials. The fermentation products as well as beneficial bacteria are generally selected in this process to control spoilage and render pathogen inactive. The special interest organism or central organism used for this purpose is lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their metabolites. They are capable to exhibit antimicrobial properties and helpful in imparting unique flavour and texture to the food products. The major compounds produced by LAB are bacteriocin, organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. Bacteriocin is peptides or proteins with antimicrobial activity. On the basis of size, structure and post-translational modification, bacteriocin is divided into four different classes. Due to non-toxic, non-immunogenic, thermo-resistance characteristics and broad bactericidal activity, LAB bacteriocins are considered good bio-preservative agents. The most common LAB bactriocin is nisin which has wider applications in food industry and has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Nisin and other bacteriocin are being used in vegetables products, dairy and meat industries. Apart from LAB metabolites, bacteriophages and endolysins has promising role in food processing, preservation and safety. Bacteriocins and endolysins are more suitable for DNA shuffling and protein engineering to generate highly potent variants with expanded activity spectrum. Genetically modified bacteriophages may also be helpful in bio-preservation, however; their safety issues must be addressed properly before selection as bio-preservative agent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29721440</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Detection of virulence-associated genes in Brucella melitensis biovar 3, the prevalent field strain in different animal species in Egypt.</Title>	<Abstract>The current study involved detection of three virulence genes (bvfA, virB, ure) by PCR in 52 isolates of Brucella melitensis biovar 3, recovered from different animal species (28 sheep, 10 goats, 9 cattle and 5 buffaloes). Of the 52 B. melitensis strains; 48 (92.3%) isolates carried bvfA genes, 51 (98.1%) isolates had virB genes and 50 (96.2%) isolates were positive for ure genes. The distribution of the virulence genes is not affected by crossing the original host barriers of the animal species, as the three virulence factors (bvfA, virB and ure) detected in 28 B. melitensis isolates obtained from ovine species in a ratio of 26/28 (92.9%), 27/28 (96.4%) and 28/28 (100%), respectively. While 10 isolates originating from goats revealed a ratio of 10/10 (100%), 10/10 (100%) and 9/10 (90%) to the same order of virulence genes. Nearly, similar results of virulence genes detection were obtained in B. melitensis obtained from bovine (8/9, 9/9 and 8/9) and Buffalos (4/5, 5/5 and 5/5), respectively. The high prevalence of virulence-associated genes among the B. melitensis isolates detected from different animal species in Egypt indicates a potential virulence of this bacterium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therapy largely centres around immunosuppression which aims to resolve the immune-mediated secondary pathology, often without eradicating the neoplastic clone. The most effective agents appear to be cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and methotrexate. This case report describes the presentation, diagnostics, therapeutic approach and outcome of a 6 year-old Golden Retriever presenting with severe neutropenia. Chlorambucil, prednisolone and cyclosporine failed to improve the neutropenia but subsequent cyclophosphamide resulted in a sustained albeit temporary improvement in neutrophil count and the ability to withdraw prophylactic antibacterials. This case closely mirrors the diagnostics and therapeutic response in human LGLL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After performing a physical examination, bloodwork, ocular ultrasonography and electroretinography, both animals were deemed good surgical candidates for phacoemulsification. Bilateral cataract surgery was performed and both rabbits regained vision in both eyes. Both animals developed post-operative ocular hypertension and one animal developed corneal ulcers immediately after surgery. Both surgical complications resolved with medical management. This case series describes phacoemulsification of bilateral cataracts in 2 companion rabbits and the use of an intraocular lens in 1 rabbit. Surgical treatment of cataracts can be considered as a treatment option whenever a healthy rabbit is visually impaired due to cataracts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, this disease can affect other vertebrates, such as dogs (secondary hosts), and lead to fatal neurological disease. The objective of the current work is to report the first isolation and molecular characterization of SuHV-1 from a dead domestic dog from Santa Fe Province (Argentina), which had had nervous signs compatible with pseudorabies. Samples of brain and trigeminal ganglia from this dog were obtained and fixed in formol for histopathology, and virology studies were conducted after cell disruption. Supernatants of both samples were inoculated onto RK13 cells and, after 72 h, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform. Purified DNA was cut with a restriction enzyme and subjected to agarose gel and an aliquot was used to amplify the gD and gC genes by PCR. The gC sequence was compared with other public sequences. The strain isolated from the dog was similar to other Argentinean swine strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Both conservative and surgical approaches are available to prevent such behavior; however, the current methods are limited by variable efficacy and risk of complications. The objective of the present study was to evaluate a new minimally invasive technique for reshaping of the tongue to prevent self-sucking. The current technique was performed on five mixed breed dairy cows aged 4-6 years and with a mean weight 320 kgs. Reshaping of the normal contour of the tongue was achieved by the application of multiple interrupted inverting sutures to the ventral surface to prevent the tongue from forming "U" shape. Post-operative approach included antiseptic mouth wash with povidone iodine solution twice daily and recording the healing process and complications. The mean operative time was 12&#177;1 minutes. No complications except superficial pressure wounds from 3[rd] up to 10[th] day post-operative were observed. At three months follow up all treated cows had stopped self-sucking. One-shot tongue reshaping is an easy, minimally invasive, effective, and time-saving procedure for the treatment of self-sucking among dairy cows, with the advantage of causing little tissue damage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Investigations included ophthalmic and neurological examinations, haematology and biochemistry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and aerobic, anaerobic bacterial and fungal culture of material from the middle ear. A 6-year-old female neutered domestic-short-haired cat presented with right-sided exophthalmos and resistance to retropulsion. Anisocoria, reduced corneal sensation and oculocephalic movements and low Schirmer tear test (STT1) were found. An MRI revealed the right external ear canal and tympanic bulla to be fluid filled with presence of a thickened contrast-enhancing mucosa. Contrast enhancement extended into the calvarium, as marked thickening and contrast enhancement of the pachymeninges, and further rostrally through the right orbital fissure into the orbit. The retrobulbar tissues were swollen, resulting in mild exophthalmos. Enrichment culture of material from the middle ear revealed Klebsiella pneumonia susceptible to marbofloxacin. The cat underwent a total ear canal ablation with removal of the cartilaginous cuff at the external auditory meatus and local debridement and curettage. A polypoid structure was removed from the middle ear. No bulla osteotomy was performed. Horner's syndrome was present immediately following surgery. The cat received a course of systemic dexamethasone (1mg/cat SID/3 weeks) tapered off and marbofloxacin (2mg/kg SID/2 weeks). Follow up at 120 days showed no recurrence of the symptoms. The Horner's syndrome and low STT1 had resolved and returned to normal values respectively. This case highlights the importance of MRI in the investigation of retrobulbar diseases. MRI is a useful tool for the evaluation of the extent of the lesion and the appearance of adjacent structures in which additional potentially life-threatening abnormalities, such as meningitis, can be seen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An MRI of the spine revealed severe meningeal infiltrate consistent with lymphoma involvement, located at the level of L2-L7 with concurrent lymph node enlargement and abnormal bone marrow. Abdominal ultrasonography also identified changes in the spleen and confirmed enlargement of the lumbar aortic lymph node. Cytology of lymph nodes and spleen confirmed a high-grade lymphoma with features of a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) variant; PCR for antigen receptor re-arrangements (PARR) was positive for a clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement. The dog was started on a chemotherapy protocol with lomustine and cytarabine incorporation and had a rapid improvement in neurological status. Chemotherapy was continued until relapse and rescue treatment used at that time. The dog was euthanased at the time of recurrence of neurological signs, 195 days since medical treatment was started. This case report suggests that combination chemotherapy may be of use when treating LGL lymphoma with spinal involvement and survival time may potentially exceed 6 months.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The resulting injury can be a complete or partial laceration, depending on the quantity of torn collagen fibres. Information obtained from imaging evaluation is of great value to the clinical approach towards PL injuries, because subsequent treatment options are affected by the distinction between complete or partial tears. Imaging diagnosis of PL damage in veterinary practice commonly relies on radiographic examination through the recognition of indirect signs, such as "patella alta", bone fragments at the level of the patellar or tibial insertion, and soft tissue opacity at the cranial aspect of the joint. Although ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been described as useful diagnostic tools for the assessment of PL tears in human patients, specific comparative data regarding the evaluation of PL rupture in dogs using different imaging modalities is lacking in the veterinary literature. This paper describes the radiographic, ultrasonographic, CT and MRI imaging findings of a partial PL tear in a dog and discusses the utility of these techniques in diagnosing this condition. CT provided more detailed information than X-ray examination in the assessment of the osteoligamentous junction, the exclusion of microfracture and distal PL avulsion, but did not add information regarding PL integrity. MRI and US provided the most useful information regarding intra-ligamentous damage and as such their combined use may be considered for the assessment of PL injuries after clinical examination and survey radiographs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Infection with this microorganism results in substantial farming economic losses and animal morbidity. The link between infection with this pathogen and human disease has been theorised for many years with Crohn's disease being one of many suspected resultant conditions. Mycobacterium avium may be spread from animal to human hosts by water and foodborne transmission routes, where the foodborne route of exposure represents a significant risk for susceptible populations, namely children and the immune-compromised. Following colonisation of the host, the parasitic organism evades the host immune system by use of molecular mimicry, displaying peptide sequences similar to that of the host cells causing a disruption of self-verses non self-recognition. Theoretically, this failure to recognise the invading organism as distinct from host cells may result in numerous autoimmune conditions. Here, the author presents current information assessing the link between numerous diseases states in humans such inflammatory bowel disease, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis and autism following infection with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis. The possibility of zoonotic transmission of the organism and its significant risk to public health safety as a consequence is also discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The evaluation of AgNORs provides an insight into the level of cellular proliferation. This technique has extensively and sparsely been used in human and veterinary histopathology respectively. However, two major drawbacks have been irreproducible results and excessive staining precipitates. This study seeks to adapt the technique to canine peripheral blood smears in order to establish a routine staining protocol. Standardized volumes and concentrations of silver nitrate, gelatin, and formic acid were applied to smears at different temperatures for varying lengths of time. The technique was applied to unfixed and fixed smears. In some cases, a reducing agent (1% potassium iodide) was applied. It was shown that the optimum staining protocol was achieved by applying standardized solutions to a fixed smear at 46&#176;C for 50 minutes. It is concluded that the staining protocol outlined in this study is practicable, and produces excellent and reproducible results that would enhance evaluation of AgNORs in canine peripheral blood cells.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS) refers to deficits in more than one of the cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI, as they are in close association in this region. The purpose of this study was to identify the presenting complaints, neurologic findings, diagnosis, and outcomes in dogs and cats with confirmed cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS). Medical records between 2002 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were neurologic signs consistent with CSS and advanced imaging and/or post-mortem examination. Thirteen dogs and 2 cats were included. Twelve dogs received advanced imaging. Post-mortem examination was performed on 2 cats and 3 dogs. Dogs were 6 -13 years (mean= 10.8 years) of age and comprised of several different breeds. Both cats were male neutered domestic shorthair, ages 3 and 14 years. Presenting complaints included mydriasis (N=4), behavior changes (N=3), hyporexia (N=3), ptosis (N=2), ataxia (N=2), pain (N=2), weakness (N=2), lethargy (N=2), and one each of epiphora, ocular swelling, polydipsia, seizures, facial muscle atrophy, dysphagia, and head tilt. Neurologic signs included ophthalmoparesis/plegia (N=13), reduced/absent pupillary light response (N= 11), mydriasis (N= 10), reduced/absent corneal sensation (N= 7), ptosis (N= 6), reduced facial sensation (N= 2), and enophthalmos (N=1). Thirteen patients had a mass lesion within the cavernous sinus, 6 of which were confirmed neoplastic via histopathology. Median survival time for the 4 patients treated with radiation therapy was 1035 days (range 150-2280). Median survival for the 4 patients that received medical treatment was 360 days (range 7-1260 days), and for the 5 non-treated patients 14 days (range 0-90 days). In conclusion mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia are common signs of CSS. A mass lesion within the CS is the most common cause. Survival time may be improved with radiation therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance of the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on the control of metabolic disorders of dogs with hyperadrenocorticism (HAC). Twenty-three dogs with HAC were randomly divided into two groups, consisting of a control group and a metformin group (10 mg metformin/kg/12 h). Both groups received the same treatment for HAC. At baseline and 3 months, blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin concentrations, in addition to urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio, Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) for insulin sensitivity and &#946;-cell function were measured. Dogs treated with metformin showed significantly reduced glycaemia, cholesterolaemia and triglyceridaemia. They also presented reduced hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance, as well as improved pancreatic &#946;-cell function. The implementation of metformin as an adjuvant therapy is effective for the normalisation of metabolic disorders of dogs with HAC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As an additional objective, serum cortisol concentrations of saliva samples obtained with or without citric acid and with or without previous pH adjustment were compared. Five clinically healthy were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatments with cottons with different substances: 1) control, 2) citric acid, 3) acetic acid, 4) sodium chloride, 5) sucrose. Each dog received one treatment per day, and in 5 days, all dogs were tested with the five treatments. On each day, cottons were applied to dogs at times 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes. The cottons with citric acid generated more volume than the rest of the treatments (p&lt;0.0001), and sodium chloride generated more volume than the control and acetic acid (p&#8804;0.03). Cottons with citric acid generated lower pH of saliva than the rest of the treatments (p&lt;0.0001). Cottons with acetic acid generated lower pH than control, sodium chloride and sucrose (p&lt;0.0001). There were no differences in cortisol concentrations between the control samples and those obtained with citric acid, nor between these same samples with and without pH adjusted with buffer. The concentration of proteins in saliva and excitement degree did not change with treatment. Citric acid was more palatable than the rest of the treatments (p&lt;0.0001). Sodium chloride and sucrose were more palatable than control (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, citric acid was the chemical stimulant that generated greater volume of saliva and greater palatability in dogs. Although the pH of the saliva obtained with citric acid was clearly acidic, its acidic pH did not affect the determination of cortisol by chemiluminescence or RIA. Sodium chloride and sucrose allowed to obtain high volumes of saliva and were more palatable than the control, which can be other interesting options to obtain saliva in case of not being able to use citric acid.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its early diagnosis allows an adequate disease control in cattle. DAVIH Laboratories designed a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay using protein A-colloidal gold as a detector reagent (LFIA-PA). The objective of this work was to compare the performance of this assay using protein G-colloidal gold (LFIA-PG) with its performance using protein A-colloidal gold as the detector reagent. The assays were carried out with 20 &#956;L of serum and 130 &#956;L of running buffer. Interpretation of bands was by visual inspection with the naked eye at 15- 20 minutes after sample application. The tests were evaluated with 449 samples of bovine serum (111 positive and 338 negative). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, the positive and negative predictive values, and the efficacy of both assays were calculated, and their concordance was estimated by calculating the kappa (k) index. The estimated values of the parameters for LFIA-PG and LFPIA-PA were 100% and 95.2% of diagnostic sensitivity, 96.2% and 97.3% of diagnostic specificity, 89.5% and 92.3% for the positive predictive value, 100% and 98.5% for the negative predictive value, and 97.1% and 96.89% of efficacy, respectively. The concordance between both tests was very good (k = 0.95). It was shown the possibilities of developing a system with LFIA-PG capable of detecting antibodies against Brucella spp. The performance of the test makes possible its use as a screening method in the diagnosis of brucellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to achieve that, 44 specimens of canine mammary tumors and 70 specimens of human breast tumors were examined in order to state points of similarity in morphology, cells of origin, behavior and existence of tissue markers. We found that the ratio of benign to malignant forms was 4.5% to 95.5% in canine samples and 45.7% to 54.3% in human samples. In both species, malignant tumors composed of infiltrating ductal cells were in the forefront despite dissimilarity in nomenclature. Other kinds of lower rate of existence included, invasive micro-papillary carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma and invasive comedo-carcinoma which have displayed similar morphology and terminology in both species. Chondroid and squamous differentiation were found in human and canine specimens. In human samples, fibro-adenoma mounted up to 30 out of 32 benign tumors (93.8%). Her-2 and Ki-67 were detected in the specimens of both species but ER was detected in human specimens only. Our findings suggest a significant degree of resemblance between certain mammary tumor in canine and human. Such findings are in support of employing dogs in research investigation for human mammary tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The rabbit was presented with a palpable, unilateral, subcutaneous left inguinal mass, consistent with the suspected clinical diagnosis of neoplasia developing within the retained testis in the inguinal canal. The intrascrotal contralateral testis was palpable, but reduced in volume. The rabbit underwent orchiectomy and both the testes were collected, formalin-fixed, and submitted for histopathological examination. Microscopically, the enlarged testis was effaced by an intratubular SCT in which numerous intratubular microliths were evident. The contralateral testis was severely atrophied. Immunohistochemical stains showed neoplastic Sertoli cells that were diffusely positive for vimentin and anti-M&#252;llerian-Hormone and multifocally positive for cytokeratins and desmin. Eighteen months after the surgery, the rabbit showed no clinical signs of disease.

Clinical, radiographic, and ultrasound findings were consistent with a proximal patellar tendon rupture with a distal patellar avulsion fragment. A proprietary Achilles repair jig system was used to reattach the patellar tendon to the patella, allowing for direct approximation of the tissues. The primary repair was supported with a protective patella-to-tibia suture, and the dog was fitted with an orthosis to restrict range of motion of the stifle. Primary tendon repair using alternative suture materials and suture placement, in conjunction with a protective suture loop and transient stifle immobilization, allowed for a successful outcome without appreciable lameness at a final evaluation 3.6 years after presentation. The dog in this report was successfully treated with a modified proprietary Achilles' tendon repair system using previously undescribed paired axial patellar bone tunnels in conjunction with a patello-tibial protective ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene suture. This technique allowed apposition of the tendon to the bone and a stable tenorrhaphy to the patella.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

T2-weighted MRI images are extremely sensitive to intramedullary parenchymal disorders, while balanced steady-state free precession sequences provide high-quality myelographic images of the spine without the need of intrathecal contrast medium administration. Multidetector computed tomography, with its near-isotropic spatial resolution and multiplanar reformatting of the acquired datasets, provides sufficient stratigraphic details of the spinal cord and the epidural space, facilitating the detection of compressive pathologies without the need of subarachnoid opacification. Nowadays, MDCT and low-field (LF) MRI have become fairly standard and available in academic institutions and private veterinary facilities, appearing to be valuable, complementary, and non-invasive diagnostic tools for imaging the spine. In this scenario, this clinical communication provides a series of preliminary observations that may help to reconsider the usefulness of CT-myelography in the light of its invasiveness and actual diagnostic advantages compared to MRI and unenhanced MDCT for the assessment of compressive and non-compressive spinal diseases in small animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30148080</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Evolutionary biology and the risk of scrapie disease in sheep.</Title>	<Abstract>Scrapie in sheep occurs in two forms. Classical scrapie, along with chronic wasting disease in deer, differs from all other prion diseases in being contagious and occurring as propagating epidemics. By contrast, atypical scrapie occurs sporadically and like most other prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, is regarded as non-contagious under natural conditions. This difference motivates the present study, which uses the perspective of evolutionary biology to explore whether atypical or non-contagious scrapie can transform to classical or contagious scrapie when appropriate evolutionary forces are in play. The study begins with an explanation of relevant evolutionary concepts such as evolvability and object of selection and proposes some explicit definitions of key terms such as variation, replication, heritability and strain. Observations of the behaviour of scrapie strains during serial passage in sheep, goats and mice assign the functions of variation, replication and heritability to the scrapie agent and establish it as an object of selection with a capacity for evolvability. Similar observations of strain behaviour in other prion diseases establish prions in general as objects of selection that are able to evolve. Accordingly, it is tenable that non-contagious atypical scrapie can provide progenitors for the prions causing contagious classical scrapie and can be a latent epidemiological threat. A comparison of atypical and classical scrapie identifies an affinity of the scrapie agent for lymphoreticular tissue and predilections for portals of exit and entry as key gain-of-function mutations that endow prion populations in atypical scrapie with the function of communicability or contagiousness. The present study can be seen as the hazard identification step within a process of risk analysis that systematises knowledge in aid of animal health and welfare and biosecurity. It justifies completion of the remaining steps in risk assessment. This task can be assisted by further comparisons of atypical and classical scrapie enlightened by historical records of scrapie disease, the epidemiology of atypical scrapie, the general behaviour of prions and evolutionary biology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ten stifles (eight dogs, mean body weight 27.3 kg) with complete rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament and a mean follow-up of 12.8 weeks (5.4 - 28.4 weeks) after TTA underwent latero-lateral, uniplanar fluoroscopic kinematography while walking on a treadmill. Immediately before TTA, each stifle was explored arthroscopically and in the case of a longitudinal or bucket-handle tear of the caudal horn of the medial meniscus the unstable axial portion was resected. The high-speed fluoroscopic video sequences obtained were inspected visually for femoro-tibial translation (cranial drawer). The influence of postoperative patellar tendong angle (PTA), cage size and meniscal surgery on stifle stability was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. In three stifles, resection of unstable meniscal tissue was necessary. Fluoroscopically, nine out of ten stifles showed cranio-caudal instability. Three stifles were potentially overcorrected (post PTA &lt; 90&#176;), seven potentially undercorrected (post PTA &gt; 90&#176;). None of the three parameters analyzed had a significant influence on postoperative in vivo stability (p=0.0988). In conclusion, it appears that inadequate cranialization of the tibia tuberosity might be an expected result of the TTA procedure, as well as persistent cranio-caudal instability during walking. However, instability cannot solely be attributed to insufficient cranialization because three out of nine unstable stifles were sufficiently or even overcorrected (PTA &#8804; 90&#176;). Further in vivo studies are needed to resolve these conflicting findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Seven dogs (13 eyes) presenting with PG as diagnosed by a raised IOP (&gt; 20 mm Hg) associated with consistent gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy of the ciliary cleft, with no other ocular disease. Patients were divided into 3 groups, corresponding to their pre-operative IOP (group 1 ranging from 21 to 30 mm Hg, group 2 from 31 to 40 and group 3 for 40 and above). Ciliary process sonication was achieved with a probe containing one high-frequency transducer operating at 21 MHz during 5 seconds. Six sites were treated in patients from group 1, 8 in group 2, 10 in group 3, under general anesthesia. Post-operative treatment consisted of systemic meloxicam and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta-blockers and prostaglandins analogues. No intraoperative complications were observed. Conjunctival hyperaemia occurred in eyes from group 2 (66%) and 3 (100%). Conjunctival burns were visible in 2 patients from group 3. One patient from group 3 experienced a hypertensive spike during the first hours post-op with associated pain. The hypotensive effect of HIFU was observed in all groups. Normotensive IOP (&#8804;20 mm Hg) was reached in all patients until the last recheck at 6 months post op. Despite the small number of patients included in the study, HIFU appears to be a promising option for the management of PG in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aimed at retrieving and detecting rabies virus antigen by direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) in formalin-fixed dog brain tissues. Forty fresh dog brain specimens were collected as paired samples from rabies suspected cases that were received for postmortem detection of rabies in the Central Diagnostic Laboratory, National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom. One portion of each paired sample was prepared for fresh fluorescent antibody testing and the other portion was prepared for epitope retrieval and florescent antibody testing following fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin. DFAT on formalin-fixed tissue exhibited a sensitivity of 100% in comparison to DFAT on fresh-tissue. No false positive result was obtained in formalin-fixed DFAT procedure, demonstrating 100% specificity. There was no apparent difference in the intensity of fluorescence in DFAT on fresh sample and formalin-fixed DFAT following heat induced epitope retrieval (concordance = 98%; 95% C.I. 0.9660 to 0.9903). The strength of agreement between DFAT on formalin-fixed and DFAT on fresh tissue was very good (Cohen's kappa coefficient value= 1.000; 95% C.I. 1.000-1.000). This study provides new information on the retrieval of rabies antigen by heat induced epitope retrieval for DFAT on formalinized tissues. Formalin could therefore, be used henceforth to fix tissues of rabies suspected cases for routine diagnosis, transportation or archival purposes. The heat induced epitope retrieval can be routinely used to retrieve rabies virus antigen for DFAT in cases where only formalin-fixed tissues are available or when preservation by freezing is difficult.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Many studies have been done on the use of symmetric dimethylarginine as biomarker of renal impairment in dogs affected by chronic kidney disease, few studies have examined his reliability as biomarker in dogs affected by heart diseases. Aim of this study was to evaluate symmetric dimethylarginine in dogs affected by mitral valve disease in order to assess his reliability in heart diseases. This was a retrospective case-control study on a clinical population of dogs affected by mitral valve disease (cases) vs healthy dogs (controls). Both groups underwent a complete physical evaluation, echocardiographic examination, complete blood count, biochemical panel, including serum creatinine and urea and urine analysis with protein-to-creatinine ratio. Serum was frozen and sent to IDEXX laboratories for symmetric dimethylarginine determination. General linear model was applied to data. A total number of 24 cases and 7 controls were included. Symmetric dimethylarginine value was in the reference value in the 75% (n=18) of cases, and in the 43% (n=3) of controls. Once set symmetric dimethylarginine as dependent variable, no statistical significant differences were found for each variable considered (breed, age, sex, weight, class of cardiomyopathy, presence/absence of valvular disease, presence/absence of congestive heart failure, pharmacological therapy, creatinine and urea concentration). Blood concentration of SDMA resulted not influenced by the variables mentioned above, so it could be considered a reliable marker of early renal impairment in dogs affected by mitral valve disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study consists in establishing the hematologic values specific to the Barb horse in the national stud farm "Chaou-Chaoua" in Tiaret. Algeria. Age of the study animals varied between 1 and 23 years. The effects of age and sex were analyzed by dividing animals into four groups, A (1 - 2 years, n=5), B (3-5 years, n=5), C (5-10 years, n=5) and D (11-23 years, n=5); for females and E (2 - 3 years, n=5), F (5-7, n=5), G (10, n=5) and H (11-25, n=5) for males. Animals studied were clinically healthy. A blood sampling was carried out from all study animals, the following hematologic variables have been determined: erytrocytes (RBC), hematocrit (Ht), hemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean hemoglobin content (MHC), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, total number of platelets (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV). The obtained results showed that the hematologic values are within established standards for the other breeds of hot-blooded horses; these values approached the lower limits of the standards for the RBCs, HCT, Hb, WBCs and the lymphocytes. Statically significant (P&lt;0.05) differences were observed between females in different age groups for the MCV, MCHC, Platelets and the MPV. Groups of males showed significant differences for lymphocytes and platelets and between males and females, significant differences related to the MCV, Neutrophils, Basophils Monocytes, Platelet and the MPV. This research showed that these hematologic parameters are weak, they approach the lower limits of the standards and that neither the age, nor the sex seem to have an influence on the hematologic values of the Barb horse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 857 serum samples were collected from year 2015 to 2016 in eleven provinces of Libya belonging to five branches of the country. Samples were tested for RVFV antibodies using a competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (c-ELISA). Antibodies specific for RVFV were not detected in any of the 857 samples. However, a statistical analysis was carried out to assess the maximum expected number of infected animals and the maximum expected prevalence of RVFV among Libyan ruminants' populations according to the sampled population. The overall maximum expected prevalence was estimated to be 1.8% for cattle and 0.4% for small ruminants. Results seem to exclude the circulation of RVFV, however, a surveillance plan should be implemented in areas at risk of RVFV introduction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diseases affecting camels in Nigeria are scarcely reported. CCE or the laboratory detection of camel PPV (CPPV) has not been reported in Nigeria. This study investigated and described the clinical presentation of CCE and molecular detection of CPPV in Nigeria. Suspected cases of CCE were reported in a farm, live animal market and abattoir, in three different states (Bauchi, Plateau and Zamfara) in Northern Nigeria. Skin scabs, lungs, liver and intestine samples were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the primers which targets the RPO30 gene fragment of the genus PPV. The clinical signs observed from the suspected cases of CCE were proliferative skin lesions, papules, scabs on the lips and nares. CPPV was detected in 80.0% (4/5) of the samples collected by PCR. CCE was diagnosed based on clinical signs and PCR results. This is the first report of CCE in Nigeria. Further studies should be carried out to genetically characterize the CPPV circulating in Nigeria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The authors present two cases that underwent OLV with use of a double lumen tube (DLT). The first case was intubated with endoscopic guidance for bronchial port intubation of the right mainstem bronchus. This dog experienced prolonged periods of intraoperative hypoxemia. Upon case review, it was suspected intubation of the mainstem bronchus resulted in occlusion of the right cranial lung lobe. In the second case, the DLT was placed bronchoscopically into the left mainstem bronchus with the aid of computed tomography (CT). Excellent intraoperative oxygenation was achieved. When DLTs are used in dogs, their anatomical differences from humans make them susceptible to additional lung occlusion and pulmonary shunting. Computed tomography is recommended as a fundamental addition to bronchoscopy for correct tube placement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clinical signs can be attributed to a flaccid and mobile stomach. This manuscript reviews the literature regarding CGI and presents a case where computerized tomography is utilized in combination with abdominal radiography to diagnose CGI in an 8 year old spayed female Great Dane. The patient presented for nonspecific clinical signs including hypersalivation, anorexia, and regurgitation, and was euthanized after failing medical management and developing acute abdominal pain. Necropsy revealed a distended stomach with 180[o] rotation along its long axis. This case demonstrates that CGI and GDV share a continuum, and cases of CGI may progress to GDV without prophylactic surgical intervention.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Based on clinical examination, histology and microbiological testing, Devriesea agamarum was identified as the causative agent of the dermal disorder. Moreover, an abundant culture of D. agamarum was obtained following sampling of the oral cavity. Cheilitis was present for three years in the spiny-tailed lizard and during the first year of that period the lizard was housed together with an ocellated lizard (Timon lepidus), an Algerian orange-tailed skink (Eumeces algeriensis) and a female U. acanthinura. The latter lizard showed signs of chronic dermatitis and had deceased approximately 2.5 years prior to initial presentation of the male dab lizard because of renal failure. The other cohabiting lizards showed no dermal lesions and D. agamarum could not be demonstrated following dermal, cloacal and oral sampling. Recurrence of the bacterial skin infection was observed following a first antimicrobial treatment. This was considered to result from failure to eliminate the bacterium from the treated dab lizard or re-infection from the environment or asymptomatic carriers. A second treatment, including disinfection of the enclosure with house-hold bleach 0.1%, weekly mechanical debridement of the crusty lesion and treatment with ceftazidime at 20 mg/kg intramuscularly every 72 hours for 57 days resulted in resolution of the skin lesions, elimination of D. agamarum from the oral cavity based on repetitive microbiological sampling and no recurrence of the lesions during a 31 month follow up period. The present case is the first report of devrieseasis in Spain and highlights the importance of a multidirectional diagnostic and therapeutic approach towards controlling devrieseasis in captive lizard collections. Several disease aspects such as persistency are discussed in the light of the contemporary available literature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7, O26:H11, O91:H21, O111:H2, O8, O127: H6, O86 and O128:H2. Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates on three toxin genes: heat-stable enterotoxin (sta), shiga toxin type 1 and 2 (stx1 and stx2) revealed two well-known pathotypes (EPEC O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7 and EHEC O26:H11 O91:H21 O111:H2) with high frequency of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Molecular analysis also showed a number of E. coli isolates that carry sta and stx1 or sta and stx2 gene and belonged to O8, and O127:H6, O86 and O128:H2. These isolates were identified as hybrid E. coli strains (ETEC-STEC) and found in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. In conclusion, the present study identified high frequency of pathogenic E. coli in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. Serological and molecular analysis of E. coli isolates showed that high frequency of EHEC and presence of a new phenotype, STEC-ETEC hybrid, revealing their importance in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One hundred adult domestic pigeons were purchased from different markets of Tripoli. Blood smears were prepared from each bird and examined using light microscopy with oil immersion lens for the presence of blood parasites. Oropharyngeal swab was taken from each pigeon and were processed through direct smear method and staining with Giemsa to identify Trichomonas gallinae. Each pigeon was examined for ectoparasites. Moreover, intestinal parasites were investigated and all helminths were counted before being fixed in 70% ethyl alcohol for further identification. Out of 100 pigeons examined, 76% (76/100) were infected with Haemoproteus spp. and 55% (55/100) with T. gallinae. The overall prevalence of ecto-parasitic infestation was 89% (82% Columbicloa columbae, 18% Goniodes gallinae, 3% Menopon gallinae and 1% Pseudolynchia canariensis). The overall prevalence of intestinal helminths in examined pigeons were 56% (56/100). Three species of Cestoda (2% Raillietina tetragona, 32% R. echinobothrida and 4% R. cesticillus) and three species of Nematoda (18% Heterakis gallinarum., 22% Ascaridia galli and 4% Capillaria spp.) were identified. Also, this study revealed that the pigeons examined were found infected with mixed parasites. The study highlights that pigeons are hosts of helminths of veterinary importance and may act as an important source of infection for other avian host, which share the common parasitic fauna.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The surgical treatment of hydatid diseases in man is still the most effective approach, but spillage of protoscolices is the risk of surgery. Therefore, it is essential to develop alternative approaches. Injection of protoscolicidal agents into the cysts preoperatively is an alternative method.The aim of the present study was the determination and comparison of lethal effects of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) on protoscolices of hydatid cyst. Livers and lungs of sheep, which was naturally infected by hydatid cyst were collected from Tabriz slaughterhouse and transferred to the parasitology laboratory. Initially, the surface of cysts was disinfected by 70% Alcohol. Then, 25 ml of each cyst fluid were aspirated by sterile syringe and transferred to Erlenmeyer flask. After 30 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and protoscolices were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and tested by 1% eosin to assess their viability. Next, the samples of protoscolices, which were over 90%, were selected and the effect of 50, 125, 250 and 500 (&#181;g/ml) of Se-NPs and Ag-NPs in the exposure times of 10, 20, 30 and 60 min were evaluated. Data were analysed by SAS software and analyzed by Duncan's comparison test. The significant differences were considered to be p&lt;0.0001.The difference between the scolicidal effects of Se-NPs was statistically significant for all examined concentrations and exposure times compared to the control group (p&lt;0.0001). On the other hand, the scolicidal effect of Ag-NPs in 10 and 20 min exposer was not significant in comparison to the control group. Overall scolicidal effect of Se-NPs was higher than Ag-NPs and the difference was significant (p&lt;0.0001).The results of the present research indicated that it is possible to use Se-NPs as an effective scolicidal treatment. It is suggested the study of employing this compound in vivo or in combination with other procedures in treating hydatid cyst in further studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 86 birds: 81 cygnets (6-10 weeks old) and 5 moulting - adult swans (3-6 years old) were examined in this study. Both eyes of all birds underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including evaluation of tear production with the phenol red thread test (PRTT) and the assessment of the IOP by rebound tonometry, employing the TonoVet[&#174;] device. The mean &#177; standard deviation of PRTT values were as follows: all cygnets (81) 22.59&#177;3.48 mm/15s, male cygnets (45) 22.64&#177;3.54 mm/15s, female cygnets (36) 22.53&#177;3.44 mm/15s.

Intravenous pathogenicity index of the isolated virus was assayed using experimental infection of 6 weeks old pathogen-specific free chicken. The peak of clinical signs was on day three post-infection, and one death was observed on day eight. The intravenous pathogenicity index of this isolate was 0.08.

Because fibrosis is a part of the alteration in the effected joints, we investigated the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&#946;1) as an important regulation molecule of tissue fibrosis. We chose Osteoarthritis following a cruciate ligament rupture (CLR) because it is a common model of osteoarthritis. A total of 13 healthy dogs and 38 dogs suffering from CLR were included in this prospective study. The concentration of TGF-&#946;1 was measured in synovial fluid using the "Quantikine Human TGF-&#946;1 Immunoassay" (Fa. R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). There was a significant difference in the TGF-&#946;1 concentration of the synovial fluid of healthy compared to affected patients (p &lt; 0.001). The synovial TGF-&#946;1 concentration also correlated significantly (p = 0.0147) with the synovial viscosity of the affected patients. No significant correlations could be observed to duration of disease, severity of lameness and degree of joint swelling, but also to joint capsule sickness, osteophyte development and degeneration of joint cartilage. The results of our study show an increased TGF-&#946;1 concentration in knees affected with osteoarthritis as consequence of CLR. So we can conclude that TGF-&#946;1 takes part at the osteoarthritic remodelling process, but different phases of the remodelling process cannot be distinguished by the measurement of TGF-&#946;1.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

These mycoplasmas are closely related immunologically and genetically which can lead to difficulties for differential diagnosis. The patterns of substrate metabolism of strains of M. c. capripneumoniae, gathered from diverse geographic regions, were studied by measurement of oxygen uptake rates. The strains fell into two major biochemical groups: one which only oxidised organic acids and glycerol and the other which could additionally metabolise sugars. Furthermore when DNA-DNA hybridisation tests were carried out these two groups of strains could be separated by their degree of DNA homology, the mean hybridisation value between members of the two groups was 86% well above the value of 70% normally used to indicate separate species. DNA-DNA hybridisation was also carried out between M. c. capripneumoniae strains and other members of the M. mycoides cluster. These experiments used labelled DNA from two representative subsp. capripneumoniae strains; these were 7/1a (organic acid-oxidising) and 4/2 LC (glucose-oxidising). The results showed a particularly close relationship of the glucose-oxidising strain to M leachii strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30538930</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Molecular detection and characterisation of avian paramyxovirus type 1 in backyard chickens and pigeons in Alzintan city of Libya.</Title>	<Abstract>Avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) is the causative agent of Newcastle Disease which affects many species of birds leading to high mortality and heavy economic losses among poultry industry worldwide. Newcastle disease is endemic in Libya with frequent outbreaks occurring in commercial and backyard poultry. APMV-1 was isolated and characterised during the outbreak in 2013. In current study, we report another Newcastle disease outbreak that emerged in backyard chickens and pigeons in Alzintan city on March 2015. Two viruses were detected in cloacal swabs from backyard chickens, namely APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5368/2015 and APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5371/2015. Genetic sequencing of these viruses revealed the presence of velogenic APMV-1 belonging to genotype VIIi genetically similar to the viruses isolated on 2013. During the same period, neurologic signs and mortality were noticed in pigeons. Samples of brain tissue were tested by rRT-PCR which revealed presence of velogenic APMV-1 belonging to lineage 4A (GKKRKR*F Lin.4A) or genotype VIb. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection and molecular characterization of APMV-1 in a pigeon in Libya. The phylogenetic analysis of the F gene showed 86% identity to isolates from Iran and Egypt. This study may indicate the circulation of APMV-1 within backyard birds and pigeons which may present a threat to commercial poultry. Considering these findings, vaccination of backyard birds and pigeons and further epidemiological studies are strongly strongly recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The experiment was arranged using a randomly completely block design (RCBD). Three kacang goats were used and each goat received three treatments namely P0 (2 mL of 0.9% NaCl), P1 (1.5 mL Capriglandin, PGF2&#945;), and P2 (2 mL of seminal vesicle extract, EVS). Semen and blood were collected two days post-treatment to measure the concentration and motility of spermatozoa and testosterone level. Testosterone levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Duration between treatments was one week after semen collection. The result showed that the average spermatozoa concentration (x10[6]) in P0; P1; and P2 respectively were 2,763.0&#177;395.0; 2,060.00&#177;678.2; and 2,387.0&#177;442.7 (P&gt;0.05), while the spermatozoa motility score in P0; P1; and P2 respectively were 3.7&#177;1.1, 3.4&#177;0.5, and 3.4&#177;0.5 (P&gt;0.05). The mean testosterone levels in P0, P1, and P2 respectively were 10.27&#177;5.42, 18.51&#177;19.46, and 29.57&#177;12.96 ng/mL (P&lt;0.05). It can be concluded that administration of EVS did not increase concentration and motility of spermatozoa but increased the level of testosterone in kacang goat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Twenty-four enterotomies were performed in 10 cm jejunal sections obtained from five dogs following euthanasia. After placement of Doyen intestinal forceps to the ends of each section, a 3 cm antimesenteric incision was performed and closed using 4-0 polydioxanone suture armed in a swaged-on needle in a simple interrupted pattern. One group served as control, with no enterotomies performed. The four groups that we used consisted of six sections each: group CC was closed with a polydioxanone suture armed in a conventional cutting needle, group RC was closed with a reversed cutting needle, group TPP was closed with a taper point plus needle, and group TC was closed with a taper cutting needle. Leak testing was performed by infusion of 13.5 mL methylene blue solution into the intestinal lumen. Significant differences between leakage and non-leakage sections of group CC were detected (P=.027). No statistical differences were detected among other groups. Conventional cutting needles seem to create leaking holes in cadaveric healthy jejunum during needle passage for closing an enterotomy incision.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present study is focused on developing an improvised methodology for the isolation of genomic DNA from stored bovine blood samples. DNA was isolated by using the conventional Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl alcohol (PCI) method and Detergent method. The aim of the study was to make a comparative analysis and evaluation of these two methods to identify the one that gives a superior quality and quantity of genomic DNA. Total (n=48) each duplicate blood samples from three different buffalo(Bubalus bubalis) breeds Banni, Surti, Murrah, three zebu cattle (Bos indicus) breeds Kankerj, Gir, Sahiwal were collected from the jugular vein. The quantity, purity of the genomic DNA was assessed based on the total DNA yield, purity ratios, spectral profile, agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and polymerase chain reaction amplification of MC1R gene product without any inhibitors. The results of our study suggest that detergent method is also suitable for extraction of genomic DNA from the bovine blood and results were significant (*P&gt;0.05). The total mean yield was found to be 329.05&#177;11 &#956;g/5ml for all six breeds while the PCI method was employed. The total mean yield of the gDNA for all six breeds was 406.6&#177;43 &#956;g/5ml of blood when the detergent method was used. One way ANOVA test showed that the total DNA yield varied depending on the isolation method used. The DNA yield obtained from the DG method was (***P&lt; 0.001) significant as compared to the PCI method (**P&lt;0.01).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Gasterophilus intestinalis (Botfly larvae) had a wide geographical distribution. The present study explores the prevalence rate of G. intestinalis 3[rd] stage larvae in Egypt from January- December 2017; besides, in vitro trials to control of this larvae and evaluation of this trial using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and histopathology of treated larvae. In the present study, the 3[rd] larval stage of G. intestinalis was found in clusters in the epithelium of the investigated stomach and infested with prevalence rate 97.2%. The highest collected numbers of larvae were found in two months; March and August (570 &amp; 520 larvae) and lowest numbers (200 larvae) were collected in October, November, and December. The calculated LC50 and LC90 values of neem seed extract were 707.9 ppm and 1090.7 ppm. The different alteration was recorded after exposure to oil extract which showed some destruction on cuticle surface as folded and corrugated cuticle, destruction of maxillae with pits on its surface, disfigure and irregularity of cephalic spines. Histopathology of exposed G. intestinalis larvae showed different changes as thinning of cuticle at the different level (exocuticle, endocuticle, cell layers), degeneration of epithelial cells of the gut and different degree of necrosis was described. Life cycle of G.intestinalis was followed up after treatment with neem seed extract.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of the review is to address zoonotic impact and epidemiological changes of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. VL is caused by L. donovani and it is endemic in many parts of the country with one third of the country's landmass is highly suitable for VL. CL is principally caused by L. aethiopica. CL is endemic and widespread in the highland of Ethiopia. Northern lowland foci are Humera and Metema plains in the Tigray and Amhara regional states constitute the main VL endemic areas in the country, contributing over 60% of the total burden. The southern foci are the south-western savannah, and the south-eastern semi-arid lowlands which account for approximately 20 % of the total VL burden in Ethiopia. Leishmaniasis is a serious zoonotic disease in Ethiopia with more reservoir hosts maintaining the disease. Dogs and hyraxes are the main reservoir hosts for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the country, respectively. Epidemiological changes of leishmaniasis may relate to environmental changes and expansion of mega projects such as irrigations and sugar cane factories, knowledge and socio-economic factors, development of new settlements, migration of peoples and HIV/AIDS co-infection. Expansions of mega projects such as sugar factories and irrigations are suitable for reproduction of stray dogs, rodents, wild canids and vectors. VL is one of the major challenges to prevent and control in the endemic areas of the country. Therefore, new research should be imperative, especially in the mega projects to design strategic control and prevention methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Surgical treatment was performed and the mass was identified as degenerated adipose tissue that was suspected to be derived from the omentum. The hernial contents were reduced without difficulty, and the dog exhibited a normal recovery. Two days after surgery, the dog suddenly exhibited anorexia and azotemia. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, which showed the dilation of both ureters with discoloration of the bladder serosa and strangulation of the urinary bladder neck. Careful inspection confirmed that a fibrous band, which was connected to the mass-like degenerated adipose tissue, had caused the strangulation. Two days after removal of these tissues, the dog recovered, with normal findings on blood biochemical analysis. The condition described in this report is an uncommon complication of perineal hernia repair. The findings suggest that degenerative fat tissue should be resected during perineal hernia repair in dogs, in order to prevent possible bladder strangulation after surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This report documents an uncommon presentation of zinc toxicosis, secondary to prolonged ingestion of a zinc oxide cream. A 5.6 kg 6-year-old ovariohysterectomised female Poodle cross presented as a transfer to an emergency practice for severe anaemia, pigmenturia, weakness, and inappetence. She had a history of vomiting and nine days of diarrhoea. Amongst other supportive treatments, a zinc oxide cream had been applied to her hind end due to severe diarrhoea scalding, and in hindsight, the owners realised she had ingested large quantities of this cream. She developed a severe Heinz body haemolytic anaemia, along with spherocytosis, left-shift neutrophilia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen. The serum zinc concentration was markedly elevated. She was treated supportively and made a full recovery. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough medical history. Zinc toxicosis can have a good prognosis when diagnosed and treated promptly.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In Nigeria, abattoir monitoring of gross bTB lesions is the only control method being applied in all animals. This study aims to investigate tubercle bacilli infection in slaughtered cattle found with visible tuberculosis-like lesions. Lesions suggesting bTB were detected in 226 cattle during abattoir monitoring in Zamfara State, Nigeria. Tissue samples collected from the affected carcasses were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen stain (ZN). Of the 226 carcasses with lesions, 37 (16.4%) were positive by the Ziehl-Neelsen stain (ZN), and MTBC was detected from 34 (91.9%) of the 37 ZN-positive samples. Molecular typing by region of difference (RD) deletion analysis revealed the genotype of Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium caprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection was most significantly associated with age of the animals (OR = 3.49; CI: 1.29-9.47 [p = 0.002]). The findings indicate a serious threat for health as well as for TB control in Nigeria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In few studies, enhanced MRI allowed to differentiate active lesions from chronic ones and to classify ambiguous lesions. The aim of this clinical prospective pilot study is to describe and compare the MRI lesions observed in horses with lameness localized to the foot using a single intravenous bolus dose of gadolinium contrast versus regional intraarterial bolus of contrast agent. Ten horses that underwent contrast enhanced MRI were included in the study. Gadolinium was injected intravenously in 3 patients and in 7 horses contrast agent was administered by intraarterial regional delivery. Regions of interest (ROI) were collected from both pre- and post-contrast images and ratios between pre- and post-contrast ROIs were calculated. No adverse reactions were noted after contrast agent injection. Injured structures that revealed greater increase in signal in post-contrast images were the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), the navicular spongiosa and the peritendinous tissues. Regional intraarterial administration of gadolinium provided higher ratio of contrast enhancement. Enhanced MRI using both intravenous or intraarterial injection of gadolinium, increased the diagnostic capability of MRI in horses with foot lesions. Nevertheless, regional intraarterial administration of gadolinium was considered the best choice due to the higher signal and lower volumes of contrast agent required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Different solvent extraction methods were utilized to extract phenolic compounds from raisin. The phenolic compounds of raisin extracts was determined using HPLC and three compounds were found, catechin, quercetin and rutin. The antibacterial activity of the acetonic extract was tested against four bacterial pathogens viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli using both disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. The acetonic extract exhibited the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus with zone of inhibition of 14mm and the MIC of 25 mg/ml. However, there was a little activity against E. coli and S. typhimurium. The methanolic extract showed good antioxidant activity as indicated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical assay (DPPH). In conclusion, raisin contains potent phenolic compounds and their application might function as promising natural preservative and antimicrobial agents in food industry and also good antioxidant food that helps to minimize the risk of degenerative diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We encountered a dog with this anomaly diagnosed by Computed tomography (CT) and portography. A two-year-old, 6.9-kg female Shih tzu dog was presented with vomiting and anorexia. The dog had no history of abdominal surgery or trauma. Biochemical analysis showed elevated plasmatic liver enzymes. CT revealed the absence of the liver parenchyma and vascular system of the left lobe, quadrate lobe and papillary process of the caudate lobe. A portosystemic shunt was also observed. The liver parenchyma and vascular system of these lobes were not detected under digital subtraction angiography during laparotomy. Furthermore, the liver parenchyma and vascular system of these lobes were not detected even when the remaining liver volume increased two months after treating the shunt vessel. CT proved itself a good option for antemortally diagnosis of hepatic agenesis in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Neurological examination findings were consistent with multifocal disease including lesions within the right cerebellum and right brainstem. Investigations included hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and urine culture. A definitive diagnosis was not achieved clinically and differential diagnoses included vascular disease, neoplasia, and infectious disease. About nine hours after admission, the cat had an episode where it became rigid and then limp. The cat became agonal and went into cardiopulmonary arrest and attempts of resuscitation were unsuccessful. Post-mortem examination revealed evidence of multiple fibrocartilaginous emboli (FCE) within the cerebellum and within meningeal vessels on the ventral aspect of the brainstem. This is the first reported case of fibrocartilaginous embolism causing an encephalopathy in a cat. While this is a rare disease, it is an important differential diagnosis that should be considered in cases of acute encephalopathies in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This led us to find an alternative that may be the freezing of organs before they are thrown into landfills. In this sense, the aim of this study was to evaluate the scolicidal effect of refrigeration at 4&#176;C and freezing at -18&#176;C. Different refrigeration times (24 and 48 h) and freezing times (3, 6, and 9 h) have been used in triplicate. Refrigeration at 4&#176;C was not sufficient to completely kill protoscolex. For 24 h, the mortality rate did not exceed 44.44%. After 48 h, mortality rates varied from 20.13% to 65.49%. The freezing at -18 &#176;C for 3 h remained insufficient to kill all protoscoleces although the mortality rate increased to 87.28%. However, freezing at -18 &#176;C for 6 and 9 h has been found to be very effective in killing all protoscoleces present in the hydatid liquids. The present study demonstrates that freezing organs seized for hydatidosis at -18&#176;C for at least 6 h may be an alternative to incineration and will sterilize hydatid cysts before they are dumped.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Algeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcus granulosus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Freezing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Refrigeration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Some researchers have suggested that a zoonotic virus or bacteria present in the livestock animal's feces or manure may be a possible etiologic factor. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), the cause of a chronic enteropathy in domestic livestock and a probable zoonosis, is heavily excreted in an infected animal's feces or manure, contaminating soil and ground on the animal's farm. Once excreted in an animal's feces, MAP lasts indefinitely in a dormant but viable form, and easily spreads outside farms to the surrounding environment. MAP's presence throughout the soil in countries where MAP infection of domestic livestock is extensive and long-standing may explain the increased rates of glioblastoma in tennis and baseball players who handle balls coated with MAP-contaminated dirt. MAP infection is consistent with glioblastoma's two defining histopathologic characteristics: endothelial cell proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. MAP is a non-tuberculous or atypical mycobacterium, which can cause hypoxic necrotizing granulomas, granulomas that resemble areas of pseudopalisading necrosis. There are known bacterial causes of endothelial cell proliferation. Almost unique amongst intracellular bacteria, MAP's variant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) enzyme, a type 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, can use a host cell's cytosolic &#945;-ketoglutarate in its own Krebs or tricarboxylic acid cycle. MAP's ability to use a host cell's &#945;-ketoglutarate may explain the survival advantage of the cytosolic IDH1 enzyme mutation for patients with diffuse gliomas including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligdendroglioma, a mutation that results in a reduced supply of cytosolic &#945;-ketoglutarate. MAP may therefore be one possible infectious cause of glioblastoma and the other histologic categories of diffuse glioma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glioblastoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paratuberculosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The influence of anesthesia on the blood flow in the heart is in detail unknown for the most avian species. The present study investigated the influence of an isoflurane anesthesia on the systolic blood flow of the aorta and the pulmonary artery in the area of the heart valves examined by pulsed wave Doppler sonography in Racing Pigeons (Columba livia f. domestica, n = 43). Measurements were taken in conscious and anaesthetized birds in the left (aorta) and right (pulmonary artery) parasternal longitudinal horizontal heart view. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in heart rate and systolic peak flow velocities as well as prolonged ejection times during anesthesia. A positive correlation of systolic peak flow velocity and heart rate could be demonstrated, especially for the pulmonary artery in conscious pigeons. The aortic systolic peak flow velocity and heart rate showed a significantly negative correlation in anaesthetized pigeons. These correlations should be borne in mind in the echocardiographic examination, especially of conscious birds. A higher incidence of second degree atrioventricular block (30.23%) was induced by anesthesia in the Racing Pigeons. These results of the present study indicate the necessity for establishing normal heart values in conscious and anaesthetized individuals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Inhalation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aorta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Columbidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography, Doppler, Pulsed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemodynamics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoflurane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Artery</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Regional Blood Flow</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The odds ratio (OR) method was employed to investigate the risk of developing HC related to breed, gender, and sexual status. The estimated prevalence of HC in the four private clinics was 0.20% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-0.27] and was significantly different compared to the university reference center (1.46%; 95% CI, 1.12-1.80). Sex, breed, and age resulted in risk factors for HC. Mean (&#177; SD) age for dogs with HC was 9.8 (&#177; 2.5) yr. Females had higher risk for HC compared to males (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24-2.75); all neutered dogs (both males and females) had higher risk than intact dogs (OR 2.54; 95% CI, 1.72-3.73); and neutered females had higher risk compared to intact females (OR 2.61; 95% CI, 1.54-4.42).

The horn fly, a major hematophagous pest of cattle, is able to transmit different diseases in cattle. However, its implication in BLV transmission under a natural environment is still discussed. The objectives of this work were to determine the presence of BLV in horn flies (by sequencing) and to evaluate the ability of horn flies to transmit BLV to cattle (through an experimental assay under a natural environment). To demonstrate the presence of BLV in the flies, 40 horn flies were collected from a BLV-positive cow with a sweep net and 10 pools with four horn-fly mouthparts each were prepared. The presence of BLV was determined by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. To demonstrate BLV transmission, other 40 flies were collected from the same BLV-positive cow with a sweep net. Eight homogenates containing five horn-fly mouthparts each were prepared and injected to eight cows of different breeds, and blood samples were collected every 21 days. Then, to evaluate the ability of horn flies to transmit BLV to grazing cattle under natural conditions, both infected and uninfected cattle from the experimental transmission assay were kept together in the same paddock with more than 200 horn flies per animal for 120 days. Blood samples were collected every 20 days and the number of flies was determined. The sequencing results confirmed the presence of the provirus in horn flies. The results also confirmed that BLV transmission is a possible event, at least experimentally. However, the role of horn flies as vectors of BLV under a natural grazing system is still discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Argentina</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzootic Bovine Leukosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insect Vectors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia Virus, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proviruses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31086764</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Ultrasound examination of coelomic viscera through the plastron in stranded green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas).</Title>	<Abstract>Many projects have been developed in the last years for the conservation of sea turtles. Young green turtles (Chelonia mydas) often nest on the Brazilian coast. Because they nest in beaches along the coastline and islands, green turtles are susceptible to fishing and accidental ingestion of anthropogenic debris. Early detection of ingested debris is crucial for the survival of rescued sea animals. Ultrasound (US) has emerged as a viable imaging technique for visceral examination in veterinary medicine. Previous studies have suggested the left and right cervicobrachial, axillary, pre- and post-femoral areas as the only viable approaches for US examination, but the acoustic windows available for imaging of coelomic structures are limited. It is important to notice that a detailed evaluation of all gastrointestinal tracts, especially the duodenum, is crucial for detecting foreign bodies and intestinal obstructive processes, as well as obtaining essential information such as intestinal motility and heart frequency. Intestinal motility and heartbeats are not detected through radiographic examination or through the acoustic windows available so far. This study aimed to establish the viability of US examination of coelomic viscera through the plastron in stranded green turtles. Eleven young green turtles rescued by the GREMAR Institute were examined. Turtles were placed in the dorsal decubitus position during US examination, which did not require anesthesia. Even though the plastron is constituted of bones and cartilage, the present research has proven the viability of obtaining US images through it, making it possible to visualize structures undetectable through the acoustic windows previously suggested. The following organs were evaluated through the plastron: heart, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, colon, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, bladder, and spleen (in case of splenomegaly). US imaging through the plastron is a viable approach for detecting ingested artificial debris, which represents one of the leading causes of death among sea turtles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brazil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Contents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Tract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turtles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Key cytologic features included numerous mildly to moderately pleomorphic histiocytic cells admixed with mononuclear inflammatory cells, occasional fibroblasts, multinucleated cells, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Based on these features, cytologic differentials included granulomatous inflammation with reactive fibroplasia, histiocytic sarcoma, giant cell tumor of soft parts (GCTSPs), and giant cell tumor of bone. The tissue biopsy supported a diagnosis of superficial GCTSPs. This neoplasm is of controversial origin but generally considered to be a soft tissue sarcoma and classified in the World Health Organization classification of tumors under fibrous histiocytic tumors as a giant cell tumor of soft tissue with low risk of malignancy. When found in the subcutis, this neoplasm rarely metastasizes in the horse and has a low rate of local reoccurrence. In this case, there was no local recurrence of the tumor after 6 mo, after which the horse was lost to follow-up.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Giant Cell Tumors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soft Tissue Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Magnetic resonance showed an intradurally located mass at the level of the right second cervical nerve root. The mass was surgically removed and the dog was ambulatory within 4 d. A 10-mo post-surgical imaging follow-up revealed a recurrence of the primary mass and another intradural/intramedullary mass at the level of the first thoracic vertebral body. Overall histological features were suggestive of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) for both masses. Immunohistochemistry was found weak but diffusely positive for S-100 and neurono-specific enolase for both masses. A diagnosis of primary MPNST for the cervical mass and of metastasis for the thoracic mass was made, possibly disseminated via the subarachnoidal space. To our knowledge, the central nervous system metastasis of MPNSTs has not previously been reported in dogs. The clinician should be aware that these tumors, albeit rarely, can metastasize to the central nervous system.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nerve Sheath Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurofibrosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Nerve Roots</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Previously only used in limited cases, this procedure shows promise for treating ligament-bone and tendon-bone interface injuries. We present a case study of a 2-yr-old thoroughbred male horse, unable to train due to recalcitrant symptoms after extensive conservative management of suspensory branch desmitis. It was then treated with ultrasonic debridement and concurrent manubrial stem cell autograft injection, to treat the ultrasound visualized lesion. Post-surgically, the patient recovered quickly, began training within 16 wk, and went onto win several races. Repeat ultrasound imaging reveals a complete restoration of the internal fiber architecture of the ligament. With a 3-yr follow-up, there has been consistent training and race performance with no re-injury. This study is the first to document the successful outcome of ultrasonic debridement with concurrent stem cell injection in the treatment of equine desmitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Autografts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Debridement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligaments</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stem Cell Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To this end, the objective of the present work was to investigate how the bone adaptation on adult equines that were trained for 4-5 yr to endurance races responds to the long-term exercise of moderate intensity by comparing to non-athlete horses. For this purpose, 14 Arabian horses were selected and divided equally into two groups; a control group formed by animals that had never practiced physical activity nor been tamed and an exercise group formed by athlete animals. Radiographs were obtained using a digital radiography system and penetrometer. The radiographs were stored and later processed to determine cortical bone thickness using the ProgRes&#174; Capture Pro 2.5 (Jenoptik, Germany), cortical bone density using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (version 6.0, Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA), and trabecular bone density using the Image-Pro Plus 4.1 (Media Cybernetics Inc. Silver Springs, MD). The EG presented an increase in cortical bone density and thickness compared to the control. This adaptation of the cortical bone in the exercised horses is an important factor in increasing bone resistance to exercise. These structural changes are related to a morphofunctional response by the bone tissue as a whole.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Density</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brazil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Conditioning, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Endurance</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, five ETEC isolates from diarrheic dairy calves (2-10 d old) from Buenos Aires and Cordoba, Argentina were characterized on the basis of virulence gene (VG) pattern, O:H serotyping, hemolytic phenotype, phylogenetic group affiliation, antimicrobial (AM) resistance profile, and presence of integron class 1 and 2. The five isolates were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of 18 bovine VGs and showed the following genotypes: F5[+]/F41[+]/sta[+] (D242), F5[+]/sta[+] (D158), F5[+]/sta[+] (D157), F5[+] (D151-9), and F5[+]/iucD[+] (D151-5). These VGs confer pathogenic potential and most of them are associated with the ETEC pathotype. The five isolates showed a non-hemolytic phenotype, belonged to five different serotypes: O101:H[-], O141:H[-], O60:H[-], ONT:H10, and ONT:H[-], and were assigned to the phylogenetic group A by the quadruplex Clermont PCR method. The AM resistance of the three isolates D242, D157, and D151-5 was determined by agar disk diffusion method for 24 AMs and they exhibited a multi-resistance phenotype (resistance to four different AM classes: Cephalosporins, Penicillins, Macrolides, and Ansamycins). In addition, class 1 integrons were found in the isolate D151-5 containing the dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassette and in the bovine ETEC reference strain FV10191 containing the dfrA1-aadA1 gene cassette. The present study revealed for the first time the occurrence of multi-resistant ETEC associated with neonatal diarrhea in dairy calves in Argentina. This finding may be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Argentina</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Integrons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serotyping</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A marked drop in egg production (55%) was recorded with eggs appearing white and soft-shelled. Mortality was in the range of 1%-2% with post-mortem lesions revealing cloudy air sacs, frothy, and congested lungs. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled tissue samples (trachea, lungs, spleen, and liver) and tested for Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, virus isolation was attempted in 9-11 day-old embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). In order to determine the prevalence of IBV serotype(s) in the flock, serum samples were screened by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using IBV antigens and antisera (Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts). Neither AIV nor NDV but IBV was detected in the tissue samples by RT-PCR. In addition, virus isolate obtained after four serial passages in ECE produced dwarfed, stunted, and hemorrhagic embryos, and the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR to be IBV. The serum samples were 100% seropositive for three serotypes with HI titres ranging from 5 to 12 Log[2]. In this study, IBV was confirmed as the causative agent of the observed respiratory distress and drop in egg production. Also, the evidence of co-circulation of multiple IBV serotypes was established, this to the best of our knowledge is the first of such report in Nigeria. We recommend extensive molecular and sero-epidemiology of circulating IBV genotypes and serotypes in Nigeria with the aim of developing better control strategies, including vaccination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infectious bronchitis virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Histological analysis revealed a severe meningoencephalitis characterized by lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltration, gliosis, perivascular cuffs, and leptomeningitis at the level of brain and brain stem. Laboratory investigations included polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and characterization by phylogenetic analysis, and evaluation of the internal ribosome entry site secondary structure in the 5' untranslated region. These tests identified the pathological agent as border disease virus, a known health risk in domestic small ruminants. Genetic characteristics of the isolated strains, closely related to ovine and caprine strain sequences from neighboring regions of Piedmont, France, and Switzerland, suggested geographic segregation and micro-evolutive steps within the species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Border Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Border disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningoencephalitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rupicapra</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study has evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of the combination of systemic bleomycin and local cisplatin as ECT agents for incompletely excised canine soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Thirty dogs with incompletely excised STSs were enrolled. The dogs received intravenous 20 mg/m[2] bleomycin, and the tumor bed and margins were infiltrated with cisplatin at the dose of 0.5 mg/cm[2]. Then, trains of permeabilizing biphasic electric pulses were applied under sedation. More precisely, 5 min after the injection of the chemotherapy agents, sequences of eight biphasic pulses lasting 50 + 50 &#956;sec each, were delivered in bursts of 1,300 V/cm using caliper electrodes. A second session was performed 2 wk later. The treatment was well tolerated and side effects were minimal. Twenty-six dogs had no evidence of recurrence at the time of manuscript writing; four had recurrence and one of the four recurring dogs died of lung metastases. Median estimated disease free was 857 d. Perivascular wall tumors response was compared to that of the other STSs, but the difference in outcome was not significant. ECT using combination of bleomycin and cisplatin appears to be effective in the treatment of incompletely resected STSs in dogs. This therapeutic approach could be a useful addition to the current options in consideration of its low cost, limited toxicity, and ease of administration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bleomycin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cisplatin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Combined Modality Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrochemotherapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoma</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Four captive-born crested screamer chicks (Chauna torquata) at a U.S. zoological institution died acutely from different causes over the course of 2.5 months. Although a hands-off approach was initially taken, each chick became acutely weak on exhibit and medical intervention was deemed necessary, but proved unsuccessful in all cases. Necropsy results of the chicks revealed various causes of death, including acute Escherichia coli colitis, aspiration pneumonia complicated by concurrent gastrointestinal Candidiasis, severe dehydration and emaciation, and acute amoebic gastroenteritis. No direct associations were found between these deaths and diet or husbandry; however, the limited literature on this topic suspects inadequate husbandry and immunosuppression to be the greatest cause of chick mortality in this species. The cases presented here are consistent with this hypothesis, but further exemplify the limited knowledge of this species and the need to optimize their survivability and proliferation in captivity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acute Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Zoo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anseriformes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arizona</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Four healthy dogs, aged between 12 and 18 months, with intact dentitions were used for the experimental work. A total of 24 teeth were available for the study by using the six upper anterior teeth of each of the four dogs used in the study. The 24 teeth included in the study were divided according to presence or absence of pulpal pressure (P) into two groups with 12 teeth in each group. P1 teeth with positive pulpal pressure and P2 teeth with no pulpal pressure. Each of these two groups was further divided into two subgroups, according to the cavity depth (D) they received, where in D1 a class V cavity with depth of 1 mm was performed, while in D2 a class V cavity with depth of 2 mm was performed. The cavities were restored with micro hybrid composite restorative material and the samples were then left in the dogs' mouth for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, the dogs were euthanized by injecting an overdose of thiopental sodium. The anterior part of the upper jaw was sawed out of each dog's mouth and the teeth were sectioned to evaluate the resin-dentin interface using Environmental Scanning Electronic Microscope. Results of the study showed that the mean resin tag length value was significantly affected by vitality and dentin depth. The presence of pulpal pressure together with depth of dentin could adversely affect the quality of hybridization.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dental Pulp</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dentin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dentin-Bonding Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microscopy, Electron, Scanning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Resins, Synthetic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tooth</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Human and livestock brucellosis is prevalent in Oman, especially in southern Dhofar governorates of Oman, where camels share habitat and have close contact with other susceptible species. We conducted a randomized cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in camels of Oman. The sera from 2,250 camels from 552 geographically marked farms were screened through Rose Bengal plate agglutination test and later confirmed by the competitive ELISA (COMPLIZA, VLA, UK). In total, nine [0.4%, confidence interval (CI) 0.4, 0.8] camels from eight (1.5%, CI 0.6, 2.8) herds were tested positive for brucellosis. The highest prevalence was recorded in Dhofar (3.7%, CI 1.4, 7.9) and the lowest in Sharqiyah (1.3%, CI 0.0, 7.2) governorate (p = 0.052). All seropositive camels were of local breed and females. Seroprevalence was higher (0.5%, CI 0.2, 1.0) in adults (&gt;4 yr of age) as compared with young (&#8804;4 yr of age) camels (0.2%, CI 0.0, 0.8). The results of binary logistic regression indicated that camel herds located in south (Dhofar) [odds ratio (OR) 6.39, CI 1.01, 40.67], practice of open replacement system (OR 14.49, CI 1.83, 114.51) and with history of abortions (OR 8.01, CI 1.34, 47.77) were more likely to test positive for brucellosis. We conclude that brucellosis is endemic at a low level in camels of Oman and a control strategy based upon test-and-slaughter/inclusion of camels in the current vaccination program after carefully planned vaccine evaluation studies could be considered to control it.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oman</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31360653</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't</Type>	<Title>Identification of dysfunctional human-dog dyads through dog ownership histories.</Title>	<Abstract>The human-dog relationship is at least 16,000-years old and is mutually beneficial to both dyadic members. When the human-dog relationship becomes dysfunctional, however, there can be serious consequences for both parties and for society. Unfortunately, dysfunctional dyads are normally only identified after consequences have been felt (e.g., dog-human aggression) limiting the action that can be taken to prevent such occurrences. To evaluate whether these dysfunctional dyads can be preemptively identified, a questionnaire analyzing the owners' dog health care histories was administered to an urban dog owning population. Multiple correspondence analysis (n = 1,385) was conducted and identified three clusters accounting for 37.1% of the total variance, while four moderate positive correlations were found: "unspecified trauma" with "vehicular trauma" (r = 0.303, p &lt; 0.001), "bitten" with "bit other animal" (r = 0.345, p &lt; 0.001), "bit a person" with "bit other animal" (r = 0.369, p &lt; 0.001), and "chronic illness" with "hospitalized" (r = 0.297, p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that a simple questionnaire can identify potential characteristics of functional and dysfunctional dyads. In functional dyads, humans tend to be responsible for their dogs' well-being, while dysfunctional dyads show the opposite characteristics, reporting experience with trauma and dog aggression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emotions</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Human-Animal Bond</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We determined the safety and feasibility of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell transplantation in two aged cats that had undergone surgery for malignancy. Case 1 involved an 18-year-old male Japanese domestic cat. The cat exhibited appetite loss and poor physical activity after the surgical excision of oral squamous cell carcinoma followed by four sessions of radiotherapy, and the owner strongly requested immunotherapy for preventing further deterioration in the animal's quality of life (QOL). We subsequently administered LAK cells three times during a 2-month period. Case 2 involved a 20-year-old female Japanese domestic cat who had undergone mammectomy after a diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma. The owner strongly requested immunotherapy for QOL maintenance. We administered LAK cells four times over a period of 5 months. Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) fractionated using density gradient centrifugation were cultured in the media containing a high concentration of interleukin-2 and supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum. The derived LAK cells were centrifuged, suspended in 10 ml of saline containing 1% of the subject's own blood, and infused into the cephalic vein of the cats over 30 min. The composition ratios of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD21 were evaluated by flow cytometry. Bacterial culture and endotoxin testing for a sample of LAK cells showed negative results in both the cases. The leukocyte and erythrocyte counts and the body temperature were assessed on days 7, 14, and 21 after the transfusion. No abnormal signs were observed in either case, which confirmed the safety of the procedure. QOL scores showed no significant changes after the treatment, and the body temperature remained steady throughout the treatment. The findings from these cases suggest that the transplantation of LAK cells derived from PBMCs may be safe and feasible for use in cats, regardless of their age.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breast Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunotherapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukocytes, Mononuclear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mouth Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

PM observations revealed cutaneous, hepatic, and splenic tumors in the Indigenous chicken. The quail carcass was emaciated with hepatic tumors. Histopathology revealed severe focally extensive non-encapsulated circumscribed large nodules with pleomorphic population of cells mainly composed of lymphoplasmacytic and mixed neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the chicken. The pleomorphic infiltration of lymphohistioplasmacytic cells mixed with neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the quail was consistent with Marek's disease virus (MDV) infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out, and the Meq oncogene of the MDV was amplified in the samples collected from the chicken and quail to confirm the presence of the virulent MDV. The samples were also subjected to PCR for detection of MDV Rispens CVI988 vaccine strain which was detected in both chicken and quail samples. The findings in this study represent the first report of confirmatory diagnosis of MD using histopathology in an indigenous chicken and Japanese quail in Nigeria. It is also the first report of the detection of MDV Rispens CVI988 vaccine strain in unvaccinated chicken and quail in Nigeria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coturnix</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Marek Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Since anesthetic procedures in such patients are rare, there is no previous report about the anesthetic management. A 5.5-year old, 32-kg Boxer, suffering a severe heart disease due to a final stage subaortic stenosis and mitral insufficiency, was anesthetized for an ovariohysterectomy to remove an ovarian tumor that was producing high-volume ascites. Methadone (0.3 mg kg[-1]) was administered intramuscularly (IM) for pre-anesthetic medication, etomidate (1.3 mg kg[-1]) and midazolam (0.2 mg kg[-1]) were used for the induction of anesthesia and after endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane vaporized in oxygen and air. Fentanyl (5-10 &#956;g kg[-1] h[-1]) and paracetamol (15 mg kg[-1]) were administered to improve analgesia. Previous persistent atrial fibrillation was refractory to medication (digoxin, diltiazem, and pimobendan) and continued during the anesthetic procedure. Dobutamine (1.5-5 &#956;g kg[-1] minute[-1]) helped to maintain mean arterial blood pressure above 60 mmHg. Epidural morphine (0.1 mg kg[-1]) and incisional bupivacaine (2 mg kg[-1]) were administered at the end of surgery to provide postoperative analgesia. Anesthesia was otherwise uneventful, and recovery was considered excellent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atrial Fibrillation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Valve Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitral Valve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Performance of methylene blue was further studied at intervals over a period of 50 minutes after protoscolex exposure using 1% dye concentration.</Abstract><Abstract>Normal protoscolices were able to adsorb and reduce the dye and have, therefore, lost the blue color. Protoscolices previously treated with warm water on the other hand, being functionally dead, failed to reduce the adsorbed dye and permanently retained the blue color. Results also indicated that a clear distinction between dead and alive protoscolices can be made within 1 minute. Reading of the test after 10 minutes would be misleading giving a false result.</Abstract><Abstract>These findings suggest that viability of protoscolices can be assessed on the basis of acquisition and loss/retaining of the dye blue color. Increasing the concentration of methylene blue to 1% was noticed to be associated with remarkable enhancement of contractility, sucker movement, and evagination. Such an excitatory action of the dye may be exploited in viability tests which adopt these criteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcus granulosus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methylene Blue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasitology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staining and Labeling</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Low iron levels are commonly caused by feeding whole milk without the addition of dietary supplements and led to the most frequent cause of anemia in calves. Other reasons for the development of anemia include congenital iron deficiency, malnutrition, bleeding ulcers, or bloodsucking parasites.</Abstract><Abstract>This study compared laboratory parameters that are commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency anemia in calves. Additionally, serum ferritin values were compared amongst calves fed different milk meals.</Abstract><Abstract>For this purpose, blood samples from 40 calves were analyzed for different hematologic parameters as well as the content of copper, glutathione peroxidase, serum iron, and serum ferritin.</Abstract><Abstract>Eight calves showed decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit values and a significantly lower number of erythrocytes compared with non-anemic calves. Interestingly, 19 of 40 calves had a low serum iron. Considering their serum ferritin levels, only 14 calves, including six calves with both low iron and low ferritin levels, were classified as iron deficient. No direct correlation between serum ferritin and serum iron was detected. Comparing milk diets, more calves fed milk replacer showed reduced levels of ferritin compared with calves fed whole milk.</Abstract><Abstract>Our data indicate that the determination of hemoglobin and serum iron is of limited suitability for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in calves. We suggest that the determination of serum ferritin should be the preferred parameter, since serum iron levels are subject to physiological fluctuation and a deficiency can be caused by inflammation or neoplastic diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferritins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iron</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iron Deficiencies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bacterial infection in intensive fish farming causes mass mortalities and the treatment of that requires the intensive use of chemicals and antibiotics. Several methods have been tried to control fish diseases including the use of antibiotics, but their haphazard use is associated with potentially negative effects as drug resistance and drug residues. The use of probiotics as biocontrol agents for aquaculture is increasing with the demand for environmental beneficial, eco-friendly alternatives for sustainable aquaculture production. The benefits of such supplements include improved food value, inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, and increased immune response. The bio-encapsulated vaccine appears to be the most attractive method for releasing of vaccines. Several bioactive molecules which are specific for some diseases have been successfully encapsulated with nanoparticles in order to enhance their availability, bioactivity, and controlled delivery. Recently, "reverse vaccine" by using bio-informatics that aids in designing vaccines against infectious pathogens that are difficult to design, especially the intracellular bacteria. Additionally, the use of bacteriophages for biological control of pathogens in cultured fish has gained much interest. Several bacteriophages have been isolated specific to various pathogenic bacteria. Oral administration of phage cocktail is the most suitable way of application in fish, especially when large number of infected fish should be manipulated. Hence, in the following paragraphs, we will discuss some promising novel biocontrol methods that target the fish pathogens like probiotics, bio-encapsulated vaccines, and phage therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fish Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phage Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Probiotics</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This covered epidemiological data, bi-planar radiographs, subjective gait analysis, owner questionnaire, surgical reports, as well as second-look arthroscopic findings when available.</Abstract><Abstract>In total, 52 CUE procedures were performed in 44 dogs with a median age of 8.0 years (IQ: 5.0-10.0) and a median bodyweight of 31.9 kg (ranging 20-48 kg) at the surgery. Four cases never return for follow-up, but were included in the analysis to increase the number of cases with pre- and intra-operative data. Mean follow-up time available for the remaining 48 cases was 7.1 (SD: 5.2) months. Radiographic derived implant positioning and alignment proved to be satisfactory in the sagittal plane but parallelism in the frontal plane was only present in three cases. Second-look arthroscopy in five cases with delayed or disappointing functional improvement showed evidence of implant-related contact lesions and progressive erosion of the medial coronoid area in three elbows. Overall, complications occurred in 11 cases (21%), being major in eight (15%) and minor in three (6%). Major complications included refractory pain and lameness 6 to 12 months postoperatively in five cases. At last follow-up, 12 cases (25%) were considered to have full function, 35 cases (73%) acceptable function, and in one case, the function was considered unacceptable. As the only variable related to functional outcome, age had a negative predictive value for full function.</Abstract><Abstract>The CUE procedure appears to be an effective treatment option for patients with MCompD. Older dogs might be at risk of having an inferior clinical outcome when compared to young patients. The reason for this is unknown and will have to be evaluated in future studies. Compared to a CUE case series of 103 elbows operated through a medial approach, using a caudo-medial approach decreased the incidence of approach-related complication. Nevertheless, the functional outcome in the current case series was less favorable than previously reported. These conflicting findings as well as the occurrence of potentially implant mechanical conflict at the medial joint compartment despite CUE warrants further studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neuroanatomical diagnosis suggested a multifocal brain dysfunction (cerebellar and cerebral). The cat tested seropositive for feline leukemia virus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated mononuclear and neutrophilic pleocytosis. Contrast computed tomography imaging revealed multiple hypodense heterogeneous areas in both cerebral hemispheres, mild ventriculomegaly at the level of the caudal fossa, and a circular sharply marginated, homogeneously hyperdense mass occupying the right cerebellar hemisphere. Postmortem study indicated a 1.1 &#215; 1.3 &#215; 1.2 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere close to the vermis. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse and severe Purkinje cell loss with a decrease in granular cell density and moderate gliosis compatible with CCD. Further, numerous neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the infiltrated mass, consistent with a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry showed CD20 expression, indicative of a B-cell immunophenotype. In humans, CCD is reported as a rare paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

The bird was bright, alert, and responsive, with a 2 &#215; 1 cm proliferative lesion on the wing. Signs of discomfort were elicited by the clinical manipulation of the wing; no other abnormalities were detected during physical evaluation. Following hematological and imaging analysis, the parakeet was anesthetized and the mass was surgically removed. The histopathology report came back with a diagnosis of incompletely excised subcutaneous low-grade EHE. A surgical revision was not feasible due to the anatomical location and tumor extension. Adjuvant electrochemotherapy was chosen to increase the chance of tumor control. Two sessions of electrochemotherapy were performed with a 2-week interval between treatments using intralesional bleomycin followed by trains of permeabilizing electric pulses.

In this breed, in fact, the pathology is widespread because in the environment of origin, the rocky desert, a hard and almost goat's hoof is not disabling so the selection against this disorder has never been done.</Abstract><Abstract>Pedigrees were taken from 141 (reference population = RP) adult Arabian Pureblood horses (51 males and 90 females) belonging to eight Italian different farms during the period 1982-2017. For each horse, the presence or not of the disorder was observed and inbreeding coefficients (F) was performed. Four grades of deformity were considered. Moreover, the environmental condition of each farm was considered: boxes, paddocks, nutrition, orientation, and hoof care and shoeing. The chi-square test was applied. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the differences in the average inbreeding coefficient (F) between affected and healthy animals, between sexes and between shod and unshod animals.</Abstract><Abstract>Two grades of deformity were observed (I and II) which give less severe manifestations, with 28 females and 25 males (37.59% of the examined horses) showing the disorder. No differences between males and females or between shod (38.29%) and unshod (61.70%) were observed. Environmental conditions do not influence the rate of pathology in the different farms, with a prevalence of the disorder ranging from 7.69% up to 100% on farm. The whole population (WP = RP and its genealogy) included 3,355 records subdivided in seven traced generations. One hundred and eighteen out of 141 horses (RP) were inbred (83.69%). The average inbreeding coefficient (F) in the RP was 0.095. Inbreeding coefficient in RP was &lt;0.05 in only 15 horses (12.71% of inbred), whereas it was &gt;0.25 in 28 horses (23.73% of inbred).</Abstract><Abstract>High inbreeding coefficients were observed in all farms and in particularly in affected animals suggesting that high inbreeding coefficients increases the probability that the disorder occurs.

The endocardium was lined with endothelium and filled with fibrous connective tissue. The endocardium of adult bovine was the thickest. Purkinje fibers appeared of pale cytoplasm with few myofibrils. They were present in the deep layer of the endocardium and in the myocardium. The size of Purkinje fibers and the amount of their myofibrils appeared to be increased with advanced age. Bundles of cardiac muscles were the main constituent of the myocardium. The myocardial bundles were separated by fine connective tissue in immature animals that showed an increased amount in the adult animals. The hypereosinophilic cardiac muscle cells were observed in the ventricles of both mature and adult animals suggesting hypercontraction during rigor mortis.

Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between insulin and iron indices. Additionally, we performed a secondary analysis of a previously reported controlled trial that was originally designed to test the correlation between iron status and the insulin response in horses. Here, we used a t-test to compare the mean values of insulin and ferritin between horses we categorized as normal or hyperinsulinemic based on their response to an oral challenge.</Abstract><Abstract>Serum ferritin exceeded published reference range in 100% of the horses identified from the ECIR database. There were no statistically significant associations between insulin indices (RISQI, log insulin) and iron indices (log serum iron, log TSI%, log ferritin).

The rectal temperature remains the standard of obtaining temperature within the clinical setting, but there are many drawbacks with this method, including time, access, animal stress, and safety concerns. Interest in using infrared thermometry in canines to obtain body temperature has grown as animal scientists and veterinarians search for non-invasive and non-contact methods and locations of obtaining canine temperatures. Here, we review evidence on axillary, auricular, and ocular region canine thermometry and the degree to which measurements in these locations are representative of rectal temperature values. Instrumentation refinement and development, as well as morphologic differences, play an important role in the potential correlation between the rectal temperature and these other locations. These caveats have yet to be fully addressed in the literature, limiting the options for those seeking alternatives to rectal thermometry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Axilla</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ocular Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rectum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thermography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thermometry</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is characterized by recurrent bleeding from the kidneys of unidentified cause. The final diagnosis is reached through the exclusion of primary urinary system and systemic causes of hematuria along with the direct visualization by cystoscopy of hematic urine jets at the ureteral orifice.</Abstract><Abstract>An 8-year-old female neutered Whippet was presented for investigation of a 4-week history of chronic intermittent macroscopic hematuria. Physical examination, systolic blood pressure, extensive laboratory workup (including coagulation profile and platelet count), urine culture, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, pneumocystogram, and double-contrast cystography were all unremarkable. B-mode ultrasound showed no abnormalities apart from a moderate amount of suspended echogenic amorphous material visible within the urinary bladder lumen. In the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) study, a large amount of echogenic ill-defined material was noted projecting into the urinary bladder lumen from the right ureterovesical junction in the fundamental mode. This material was more conspicuous and markedly contrast-enhancing in the harmonic mode. Ultrasound contrast medium has the unique property to strictly remain within the vessels without interstitial trapping or elimination by the kidneys. Indeed, the presence of the micro-bubbles into the urinary tract lumen in the CEUS study was interpreted as a direct sign of active urinary tract bleeding. A diagnosis of IRH was reached through CEUS and B-mode ultrasound along with an extensive laboratory workup and periodic follow-up of the patient. No therapy was administered and at a 1-year follow-up, the patient was alive with no current episodes of macroscopic hematuria reported.</Abstract><Abstract>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of CEUS for the characterization of IRH.

Erroneous pin placement may lead to intra-articular damage; however, the path of the pin tract has not been thoroughly investigated.</Abstract><Abstract>To document the rate and identify potential risk factors of intra-articular jig pin placement in dogs undergoing TPLO with the use of a TPLO jig.</Abstract><Abstract>Medical records and pre- and postoperative radiographs (2007-2017) of 696 dogs with TPLO performed with a jig were reviewed. Primary surgeon and tibial plateau angles (TPA) were recorded. Postoperative radiographs were evaluated and classified according to intra-articular jig pin placement. Medial tibial plateau jig pin placement was defined as a radiolucent tract on the osteochondral junction of the medial tibial plateau. Lateral tibial plateau placement was defined as a radiolucent tract within 3 mm of the medial tibial plateau with a pin trajectory penetrating the lateral tibial plateau. Rates of intra-articular jig pin placement were calculated, and associations between intra-articular jig pin placement and surgeon experience and TPA were assessed with a chi-squared test.</Abstract><Abstract>Thirty-seven (5.32%) dogs had intra-articular placement of the jig pin. Seven dogs had medial tibial plateau jig placement, and 30 had lateral tibial plateau placement. There was no relationship between the TPA or surgeon level of experience and intra-articular placement of the pin.</Abstract><Abstract>This study serves as a reminder to be cautious when placing the proximal jig pin during TPLO to avoid intra-articular placement. In addition, guidelines for evaluating proximal jig pin placement on postoperative radiographs are provided.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Nails</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Knee Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Seven novel missense SNPs, including N57T, N115Y, D120N, D139N, G152V, E189K, and F211V, were observed in the mecA amplicons. Multiple state-of-the-art in silico tools were utilized to assess the consequences of each observed SNP in terms of its effect on the corresponding PBP2A protein structure and function. It was shown that some MRSA isolates exhibited a highly PBP2A-damaging SNP, G152V, which showed an entirely deleterious effect on the PBP2A. Furthermore, G152V induced an alteration in the PBP2A interaction with its receptor, which presumably reduced its affinity to bind with the beta-lactams.</Abstract><Abstract>The present report indicated a possible role for the observed deleterious G152V SNP in the reduction of PBP2A binding with beta-lactams, which has led to a remarkable increase in MRSA's resistance to antibiotics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mutation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Penicillin-Binding Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Genetic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Humoral immune response depression is due to perturbation of soluble factors, as complement and chemokines in innate immunity and antibodies or cytokines in adaptive immunity. At the cellular immune response, immunosuppression is the consequence of the dysfunction of T-cells, B-cells, heterophils, monocytes, macrophages, and natural Killer cells. Immunosuppression in turkeys can be caused by numerous, non-infectious, and infectious agents, having variable pathological and molecular mechanisms. Interactions between them are very complex. This paper reviews the common viruses inducing clinical and sub-clinical immunosuppression in turkeys, and enteric and neoplastic viruses in particular, as well as the interactions among them. The evaluation of immunosuppression is currently based on classical approach; however, new technique such as the microarray technology is being developed to investigate immunological mediator's genes detection. Controlling of immunosuppression include, in general, biosecurity practices, maintaining appropriate breeding conditions and vaccination of breeders and their progeny. Nevertheless, few vaccines are available against immunosuppressive viruses in turkey's industry. The development of new control strategies is reviewed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immune Tolerance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity, Cellular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity, Humoral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkeys</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virus Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Some symptom checkers also provide advice on how urgent medical attention should be sought. In addition to human symptom checkers, several tools are also available to check the symptoms of animals and provide veterinary triage advice. Unlike in human symptom checkers, this widespread availability has not lead to investigations of these tools. Indeed, little to no peer-reviewed research has been published regarding animal symptom checkers. This paper aims to describe some examples of animal symptom checkers.

Observation of laryngeal function in dogs and cats is performed by transoral visualization. There are a variety of surgical techniques; aspiration pneumonia is the most common complication associated with surgical correction of laryngeal paralysis. The aim of this case series is to report on the placement of a laryngeal silicone stent in seven dogs with laryngeal paralysis and its use as an alternative treatment of respiratory distress caused by laryngeal paralysis and/or its use for laryngeal stenosis as complication of laryngeal paralysis surgery.</Abstract><Abstract>Seven dogs presented with either episode of gagging, mild-to-severe inspiratory distress, or cyanosis because of a laryngeal paralysis or laryngeal stenosis. In each case, the laryngeal paralysis was diagnosed by direct laryngoscopy. They were treated with a silicone laryngeal stent (Stening[&#174;]) that substantially improved the clinical signs. Each dog had a different outcome because of other pathologies; however, the laryngeal pathology was successfully treated with the stent.</Abstract><Abstract>The placement of the laryngeal stent is an easy technique to learn and practice, it could avoid the life-threatening complications of the laryngeal paralysis at the acute phase, and it could be a noninvasive and long-term alternative therapy for laryngeal paralysis in dogs.

Infection within the central nervous system of affected dogs has not been previously reported.</Abstract><Abstract>A 6-year-old spayed female mixed-breed dog was evaluated at a referral institution with a 2-month history of suspected fungal infection in the region of the right mandibular lymph node that was refractory to surgical resection and empiric medical therapy. Physical examination identified a 6-cm fluctuant subcutaneous mass caudoventral to the ramus of the right mandible and a second firm mass in the region of the right caudal maxilla. Lesional punch biopsies were submitted for fungal culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which subsequently identified L. giganteum forma caninum infection. Initial treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory doses of prednisone and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Four weeks following initial evaluation, the patient was presented with progressive neurological signs consistent with a forebrain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed soft-tissue, contrast-enhancing lesions ventral to the calvarium adjacent to the site of original surgical resection and throughout the brain. Humane euthanasia was elected, and postmortem examination was consistent with the extension of local disease from the right masseter muscle into the right ventral calvarium. Postmortem DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the organism as L. giganteum forma caninum.</Abstract><Abstract>This is the first reported case of intracranial lagenidiosis in the dog.

The diagnosis of OA was confirmed by orthopedic and radiographic examination. Pain was evaluated in each dog with the canine brief pain inventory (CBPI), compiled by the dog owners, as well as with a visual analog scale (VAS) and the colorado state canine chronic pain scale, used by the clinician. The LLLT was performed weekly in each study dog, for a total period of 6 weeks.

No such techniques are described in the alpaca, bar the use of epidural. This is in part due to the lack of anatomical description for this species. While this limitation exists, the use of ultrasound guidance makes peripheral nerve blocks a viable possibility in the alpaca.</Abstract><Abstract>A 12-month-old alpaca was referred for the treatment of a septic left tarso-crural joint. Due to a poor prognosis, amputation of the limb under general anesthesia was performed. Sciatic and psoas compartment blocks were attempted with the ultrasound-guided injection of ropivacaine prior to the start of the procedure. While the femoral nerve was possible to visualize, no obturator nerve was identified. A 5-year old alpaca was also referred for a left hind lateral claw removal, due to a squamous cell carcinoma. The sciatic nerve block was performed prior to the claw amputation under general anesthesia. No changes in heart and respiratory rate, or blood pressure suggestive of nociception, were observed in either of these cases. At the end of both the procedures, the patients experienced uneventful recoveries characterized by the ability to maintain the standing position, interest in food, and normal behavior.</Abstract><Abstract>This report identifies the ease of performance and the challenges encountered using the ultrasound-guided psoas compartment and sciatic nerve blocks in the alpaca.

In some breeds, the disease results from an inherited defect in copper metabolism. In others, it is unclear whether its acummulation is a primary or secondary condition. Reports of copper accumulation in dog breeds that are not genetically predisposed are increasing.</Abstract><Abstract>To describe the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory findings, liver biopsy techniques, and treatment response in dogs with CAH.</Abstract><Abstract>A retrospective study was performed, drawing upon medical records from CAH dogs at a Veterinary Referral Hospital in Paris, France. The diagnosis of CAH had been confirmed in these patients by positive rhodanine staining of hepatic tissue obtained through biopsy. Medical records were mined for the following data: age at presentation, sex, breed, chief presenting complaints, abdominal ultrasound (US) findings, and rhodanine staining pattern.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 17 dogs were included in the study. Median age at presentation was 8-year old (4-11). No sex predisposition was found. Terriers (4/17) and German Shepherd Dogs (GSD, 3/17) were overrepresented. American Staffordshire Terriers and Beauceron had not previously appeared in case reports on CAH; two of each breed were identified in this study. Clinical signs of affected dogs were non-specific. An incidental identification of increased liver-enzymes was observed in 5/17 dogs. A heterogeneous, mottled liver was frequently described (5/17) on abdominal US. Liver biopsies were performed by US-guided percutaneous approach in 10/17 dogs, laparoscopy and laparotomy in 6/17 and 1/17, respectively. The rhodanine staining pattern was centrilobular (zone 3) in 8/17 dogs and periportal (zone 1) in 3/17 dogs. The pattern was considered multifocal in 6/17 dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>Increased liver enzymes may be the only clinical finding in dogs with copper-associated hepatitis, reflecting the silent progression of this disease. Centrilobular pattern of rhodanine staining was observed in the majority of cases suggesting the primary condition of the disease. Results of this study are consistent with the current literature, which reports that terriers and GSD are predisposed to CAH.

The survey responses of dog owners in the UK and Australia were compared against responses to a similar survey conducted in the US in 2017. Surveys were completed by dog owners who were in the clinic for any reason other than a sickness visit. Additionally, veterinarians that prescribed fluralaner from all three countries provided their annual flea and tick treatment recommendation for dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>A sample of veterinarians from the US, UK, and Australia that prescribe fluralaner recommend that dog owners obtain approximately 12 months of flea protection per year and 9-12 months of tick protection per year. A variable proportion of owners (22%-90%) reported that their dog participates in outdoor and social activities associated with an increased flea and tick exposure risk. A similarly variable proportion of owners reported prior experience of finding fleas (24%-50%) or ticks (18%-35%) on their dogs. All participating owners treated their dogs currently with fluralaner and most (68%-77%) had previously treated their dog with monthly flea and tick products. The convenience of 12-week dosing and less frequent dosing were the most frequently identified product qualities associated with their choice of an extended effect flea and tick treatment.</Abstract><Abstract>Most veterinarians surveyed in this survey recommended year-round use of a flea and tick medication for dogs in the US, UK, and Australia. Dog owners recalled the veterinary recommendation for flea and tick prevention as 8-10 months per year. Most dog owners from the clinics in the US, UK, and Australia had used shorter-acting (monthly) flea/tick medications previously. The majority of those who currently gave fluralaner doses to their dogs were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the extended duration flea and tick product. Preference for a 12-week duration medication over monthly re-treatment was also high (82%-92%) in all three countries and was associated with convenience.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adolescent</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged, 80 and over</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Australia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Child</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flea Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoxazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Personal Satisfaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tick Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United Kingdom</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Young Adult</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are the three major coronaviruses of present-day global human and animal health concern. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the newest disease, presumably of bat origin. Different theories on the evolution of viruses are in circulation, yet there is no denying the fact that the animal source is the skeleton. The whole world is witnessing the terror of the COVID-19 pandemic that is following the same path of SARS and MERS, and seems to be more severe. In addition to humans, several species of animals are reported to have been infected with these life-threatening viruses. The possible routes of transmission and their zoonotic potentialities are the subjects of intense research. This review article aims to overview the link of all these three deadly coronaviruses among animals along with their phylogenic evolution and cross-species transmission. This is essential since animals as pets or food are said to pose some risk, and their better understanding is a must in order to prepare a possible plan for future havoc in both human and animal health. Although COVID-19 is causing a human health hazard globally, its reporting in animals are limited compared to SARS and MERS. Non-human primates and carnivores are most susceptible to SARS-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas the dromedary camel is susceptible to MERS-coronavirus. Phylogenetically, the trio viruses are reported to have originated from bats and have special capacity to undergo mutation and genomic recombination in order to infect humans through its reservoir or replication host. However, it is difficult to analyze how the genomic pattern of coronaviruses occurs. Thus, increased possibility of new virus-variants infecting humans and animals in the upcoming days seems to be the biggest challenge for the future of the world. One health approach is portrayed as our best way ahead, and understanding the animal dimension will go a long way in formulating such preparedness plans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Betacoronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelids, New World</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chiroptera</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Susceptibility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eutheria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferrets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lions</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pandemics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumonia, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Primates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Raccoon Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>SARS-CoV-2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Snakes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tigers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viverridae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Climate change presents challenges both direct and indirect for livestock production and health. With more frequent extreme weather events including increased temperatures, livestock health is greatly affected by resulting heat stress, metabolic disorder, oxidative stress, and immune suppression, resulting in an increased propensity for disease incidence and death. The indirect health effects relate to the multiplication and distribution of parasites, reproduction, virulence, and transmission of infectious pathogens and/or their vectors. Managing the growing crossbreeding livestock industry in Bangladesh is also at the coalface for the emerging impacts of climate change, with unknown consequences for the incidence of emerging and re-emerging diseases. Bangladesh is now one of the most vulnerable nations to global climate change. The livestock sector is considered as a major part of food security for Bangladesh, alongside agriculture, and with one of the world's largest growing economies, the impacts are exaggerated with this disaster. There has been no direct study conducted on the impact of climate change on livestock health and the diseases in Bangladesh. This review looks to explore the linkage between climate change and livestock health and provide some guidelines to combat the impact on livestock from the Bangladesh perspective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Agriculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Climate Change</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Communicable Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disasters</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Economic Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Security</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Response</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the main clinical protocol for the management of SCI is surgery to decompress and stabilize the vertebra. Cell transplantation therapy is a very promising strategy for the treatment of chronic SCI, but extensive preclinical and clinical research work remains.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this study is to confirm the effect of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation for chronic SCI in dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>We tested the treatment efficiency of chronic SCI in 12 dogs using BM-MNC transplantation.

Non-refrigerated medications typically require storage between 8&#176;C and 25&#176;C.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to investigate the potential for thermal stress associated with vehicular storage and transportation of drugs and dogs in a temperate climate, such as the United Kingdom.</Abstract><Abstract>The study used data loggers to continuously record internal temperatures of four vehicles at 15-minute intervals over a two-year period, to investigate the effect of seasonality and time of day on the internal car temperature.</Abstract><Abstract>The internal car temperature ranged from -7.4&#176;C to 54.5&#176;C during the study period. Temperatures fell below 8&#176;C every month, except June and July. The internal car temperature exceeded typical drug storage recommendations (&gt;25&#176;C) during every month, and exceeded the canine thermoneutral zone (&gt;35&#176;C) from April to September. Peak temperatures occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 hours.</Abstract><Abstract>The results demonstrate the year-round potential for thermal stress of both dogs and drugs left in cars. Public awareness campaigns highlighting the risks of leaving dogs in hot cars are typically launched in late spring, but should consider launching earlier in light of these findings. Veterinary surgeons transporting drugs should take measures to ensure that drugs are stored within the manufacturer's temperature range year-round.

Many scientific researches focusing on the myth of nutritional and therapeutic properties of camel milk have been brought to public attention.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to clarify the impact of early weaning on constituents and nutritional values of the milk of camels reared under a modern farming system during four months postpartum.</Abstract><Abstract>Eight lactating camels and eight calves were selected immediately after calving and were assigned to two equal groups under a semi-intensive system in a farm. In the early weaning group (G1), all the calves were allowed to freely suckle their mother's teats from birth to 30 days postpartum. Afterward, the calves were used to stimulate milk letdown for each of the camels' teats for a few seconds before the milking procedure. While in the late weaning group (G2), the calves freely suckled their mother's teats up to 80 days postpartum. Afterward, the calves were restricted from suckling and were used mainly to stimulate milk letdown for the milking procedure. Collection of milk samples started in the 2nd week of postpartum and continued over biweekly intervals up to 16 weeks to determine major fat, protein, lactose, solid non-fat (SNF), and density percentages.</Abstract><Abstract>The results revealed significant differences in fat, lactose, and density content between groups.

Coronavirus was not thought to be a significant problem in humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, but infections in animals, including pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry, have been problematic for a long time. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, drew special attention towards this virus once again. The intermediate host of this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is yet to be determined, but it has a very close genomic relationship with the bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV), RaTG13 strain, and the pangolin coronaviruses. As veterinary medicine has a long-term experience dealing with coronaviruses, this could be helpful in better understanding and detecting the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and drive human medicine towards the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs through the collaborative and transdisciplinary approaches of One Health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>One Health</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Species Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Interruption or blockage of Chi brings about disorders, pain, and diseases. Acutherapy, therefore, aims at correcting the interruption or blockage of the harmonious flow of Chi along the meridian to restore the healthy condition of the body system. This correction could be accomplished by either acupuncture or acupressure, and are both collectively referred to as acutherapy. This form of therapy has been used in both humans and animals for several decades. It is, however, just gaining popularity in the treatment of humans and is still not yet in practice among veterinarians for animal patients in most developing countries like Nigeria. This review, therefore, is aimed at exposing veterinarians from the developing countries to the general application of acutherapy with emphasis on the musculoskeletal system and associated pain where it is most applied. It is highly recommended that the universities, where Veterinary Medicine is studied in developing countries, should endeavor to train their veterinary surgeons in this area and see to how acutherapy can be included in the curriculum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acupuncture Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Developing Countries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Education, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Musculoskeletal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The main goals of using this category of alternatives are maintaining the gut microbiome in healthy conditions and preventing the attachment of pathogenic organisms at the early life stages. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have been widely used for several years as growth promoters and as preventive measures against several enteric pathogens with successful results. Recently, paraprobiotics and postbiotics are derivatives of probiotic cultures and have been used in humans, animals, and poultry. They are regarded as immunostimulators, anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, and anti-microbial, as well as growth promoters. Till now, there is scanty information about the use of paraprobiotics and postbiotics in animals or in the poultry sector. Accordingly, this review article has focused on defining these new categories of natural alternatives with descriptions of their types, functions, and uses, especially in the poultry field.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Probiotics</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>33614437</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>What are the potential biomarkers that should be considered in diagnosing and managing canine chronic inflammatory enteropathies?</Title>	<Abstract>Chronic inflammatory enteropathies in dogs are characterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs that last for more than 3 weeks. Despite unclear etiopathogenesis, it is considered that a genetic predisposition associated with environmental factors, such as dietary antigens and intestinal microbiota, might induce an abnormal immune response in the host. The diagnosis of this condition requires full investigation in order to exclude all other possible causes. Currently, the observation of clinical signs associated with histopathologic evaluation and systematic therapeutic trials is the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic enteropathies. Furthermore, diagnosis, monitoring the disease progression, and treatment response evaluation can be exhausting, since this whole process is time-consuming, costly, and partially invasive. Therefore, biomarkers appear as non-invasive tools, which can be useful in evaluating gastrointestinal function, identifying the presence of the disease and assessing its natural progression, monitoring gastrointestinal inflammation, predicting response to treatment, and clinical outcomes. Over the past decade, several studies were conducted in order to explore the clinical utility of biomarkers. Thus, the aim of this dissertation is to provide an overview of the biomarkers considered relevant in the diagnosis and management of dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies. The biomarkers addressed in this study may be serological, present in urine and feces, or even tissue-derived. This study argues that biomarkers, in particular calprotectin and calgranulin C, have great potential to be used in clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of affected dogs. However, a single biomarker cannot assuredly predict disease severity, progression, response to treatment, and clinical outcomes. Therefore, in order to achieve greater accuracy, it would be beneficial if these tools are used in conjunction with contemporary ones. Future research is needed with the aim to better determine the usefulness of these tools in chronic inflammatory enteropathies in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It has a high nutritious value and is also a valuable product on the local, national, and international markets, making it the ideal candidate to research and invest in.</Abstract><Abstract>This study is a comparative experimental study of the possible burn healing effects between imported South African raw Shea butter and samples in a Libyan market.</Abstract><Abstract>The control samples were brought from South Africa (Benin traditional markets). A total of 18 different samples were collected from different sale centers in Tripoli, including pharmacies, beauty shops, and spices shops, in addition to one sample brought from Poland. Animal experiment on burn healing effect was carried out on nine male Sprague Dawley (350-400 g) rats aged 6-8 weeks old. After shaving the animal's dorsum hair, a metal cube was used to create a deep second degree burn wound, and the cube was heated to 100&#176;C for 20 seconds. Medication with Shea butter (control, T1, and T2) was initiated daily for one for these groups by the application of a thin film of the Shea butter samples on the burned areas. On days 1, 3, and 7, the rats were anesthetised and a sample from the burned scar tissue and skin adjacent were evaluated using pathological parameters.</Abstract><Abstract>The histological study indicates that the use of Shea butter T1 as topical treatment induces an immune response, which enhances the form of the presence of a large number of inflammatory cells in the epidermis and dermis layers. The treatment of burned skin with T2 lasted for 72 hours and it showed slightly significant healing in the normal structure of proliferative granulation tissue with accumulation of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells surrounding the sebaceous glands and hair follicles. Small areas of the epidermis which formed few layers were observed and some hair roots were grown. This was well seen in cases of T1 and T2.

Traditionally, large-bore trocar-type thoracostomy tubes have preferentially been used for the drainage of thick material from the pleural space. In recent years, the use of small-bore wire-guided thoracic drains has increased in both small animals and in humans. Few studies have highlighted the efficacy of small-bore wire-guided thoracostomy tubes.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was to describe the use of small-bore wire-guided thoracostomy tubes in feline pyothorax in terms of efficacy, safety, and outcome.</Abstract><Abstract>Cats with pyothorax managed with small-bore thoracostomy tubes (SBTTs) (2015-2018) were retrospectively studied. The number of drains inserted, the need for anesthesia and analgesia for chest tube placement and maintenance, and related major and minor complications were reviewed. Clinical data, diagnostic results, treatment, and outcome were recorded.</Abstract><Abstract>Ten cats were enrolled. Thoracostomy tube placement was unilateral in 7/10 cats, despite the presence of bilateral effusion in 9/10 cats, and required sedation (8/10) or anesthesia (2/10). Three cats experienced minor complications during the chest tube insertion, including self-limiting pneumothorax (1/3) and malpositioning (2/3). One cat had a major complication (non-functional malposition) requiring reposition of the drain. Pain management was adequately achieved using opioids (8/10) or opioids plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2/10). Partial chest tube occlusion occurred in three cases and it was resolved with lavage. In one case, the occlusion was complete, requiring drain removal. Three out of 10 cats were treated medically, combining thoracostomy tubes and antibiotics, while 7/10 cats underwent surgery. All the cats survived.</Abstract><Abstract>SBTTs represent a safe and effective option for the initial management of feline pyothorax. In fact, mainly minor complications were reported during insertion and usage. The SBTTs were well tolerated by the cats with a satisfactory performance in terms of exudate drainage in most cases. The combined use of a small-bore thoracostomy drain together with the common practice of surgical treatment might have resulted in the successful management of the cases presented.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chest Tubes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Empyema, Pleural</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracostomy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although conservative treatment aimed at resolving discomfort and preserving the tendon remains the primary therapeutic goal, in certain cases it is necessary to surgically transect the tendon to eliminate pain and lameness. Transection of the tendon can be performed by open arthrotomy, arthroscopically, or percutaneously using a scalpel blade. This paper examines the utility of a modified percutaneous approach using a hypodermic needle in place of a scalpel blade, under ultrasound-guided assistance.</Abstract><Abstract>To develop and describe a surgical technique for performing a percutaneous biceps tenotomy using a hypodermic needle under ultrasound guidance.</Abstract><Abstract>The technique was piloted using the shoulders of 12 cadaver dogs initially and once developed, then applied to another 12 cadavers. The final procedure was performed on a total of 22 shoulders. Assessments were recorded on time to complete the procedure, completeness of bicipital tendon transection, and presence of any iatrogenic damage to associated joint structures.</Abstract><Abstract>Procedure time averaged fewer than 2 minutes. Complete transection was achieved in 20 out of 22 of the shoulders, with evidence of incomplete transection discernable by ultrasound imaging in the remaining two shoulders. One cadaver shoulder experienced iatrogenic damage secondary to incorrect hypodermic needle angulation.</Abstract><Abstract>Percutaneous biceps tenotomy using a hypodermic needle is an efficient and straightforward procedure. The lack of a surgical incision makes it the least invasive technique devised so far.

In toy- and small-breed dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR), an acquired heart disease, these techniques are more difficult to perform than for congenital heart diseases in young medium-sized or large dogs because of old age and low body weight. Therefore, improved open-heart techniques and mitral valve surgery for severe MR in older toy- and small-breed dogs are essential. Through our surface-cooling hypothermia (sHT) studies, we designed a new, improved open-heart method, namely, "the low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) combined with deep sHT in toy- and small-breed dogs (Japan method)"; sHT was later replaced by blood-cooling hypothermia (bHT). At the same time, we devised a new, improved mitral valve plasty (MVP) applicable to severe MR, instead of mitral valve replacement, in toy- and small-breed dogs. This MVP technique was combined with artificial chordal reconstruction, semi-circular suture annuloplasty (AP), and direct scallop-suture valvuloplasty. These MVP techniques are simple, durable, and lead to good long-term quality of life in toy- and small-breed dogs. This review highlights the benefits of our improved CPB and MVP techniques (Japan method) for severe MR in toy-and small-breed dogs, which have led to a high success rate for MVP in severe clinical MR cases in Japan. It may further contribute to the development of more robust techniques for MR in toy- and small-breed dogs. This also represents the first comprehensive review of the history of open-heart surgery, CPB techniques, and MVP methods for MR in toy- and small-breed dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiac Surgical Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitral Valve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitral Valve Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Species Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, in Libya, bee venom therapy (BVT) has become a popular method among alternative healthcare practitioners for treating male infertility. However, a literature search did not find any published studies that investigated the use of BVT for infertility treatment.</Abstract><Abstract>To investigate the effect of bee venom on the male reproductive status through measurements of semen quality parameters and testicular histological changes in adult male mice.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 48 male mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups (which were subdivided into two subgroups with eight mice each) as follows: control, bee venom sting (BVS), and bee venom injection (BVI). The normal control subgroup mice were not subjected to any treatment, while the vehicle control subgroup mice were injected (i.p.) with 200 &#956;l of 0.9% saline solution. In the BVS-treated subgroups, each mouse was stung by one live bee for five times (BVS-5) or seven times (BVS-7) every third day for 2 or 3 weeks. While each mouse in the BVI-treated subgroups received 23 &#956;g/kg in a dose volume of 200 &#956;l BVIs (i.p.) for five times (BVI-5) or seven times (BVI-7) every third day for 15 or 21 days.</Abstract><Abstract>The findings of this study showed that repeated bee venom treatment by sting or injection to adult male mice resulted in a significant decline in testosterone levels, sperm count, sperm motility, and a very significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm morphology; also, there were harmful testicular histological changes in the structural organization of seminiferous tubules and degenerative changes in the germinal epithelium compared to control group.</Abstract><Abstract>The results of this study provide evidence for the low semen quality and adverse testicular histological changes in male mice treated with bee venom.

Other feline ectoparasiticides, including other systemic isoxazolines, are approved for redosing at monthly intervals. A survey developed in 2016 to assess the satisfaction, preference, and adherence of dog owners prescribed fluralaner as an ectoparasiticide with the treatment and veterinary flea and tick protection recommendations was adapted for completion by cat owners in the USA.</Abstract><Abstract>The study objective was to use cat-owner survey data obtained at US veterinary practices to assess client satisfaction and utilization practices for fluralaner, and to evaluate owner adherence to current flea and tick control recommendations.</Abstract><Abstract>US veterinary practices (n = 26) were asked to obtain completed surveys for up to 25 active clients who were currently treating their cats with a topical preparation of fluralaner for flea and tick control. Clients who had previously used flea and tick products for cats other than fluralaner were enrolled in the study. Participating cat owners completed an 11-question survey on their satisfaction with, preference for, and adherence to treatment recommendations for topically applied fluralaner as a feline flea and tick control medication.</Abstract><Abstract>The average cat in this study had a mean (&#177; SD) body weight of 5.1 (&#177; 0.9) kg and was 7.1 (&#177;1.4) years old. Most cats lived in a home versus an apartment and more than half spent some time outside. Satisfaction was assessed with a 5-point Likert scale, with nearly all cat owners (97%) indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with fluralaner. Most of them (66%) had previously used other monthly flea and tick products for cats. Owners were not excluded if they had previously used a canine flea and tick product. The extended dosing interval up to 12 weeks was the most frequently selected benefit of fluralaner. Nearly 9 out of 10 respondents indicated they readministered fluralaner mostly on time or delayed by a few days, and most said they were more likely to give a repeat dose of fluralaner at the recommended redosing interval compared to monthly products. 87% of the responding cat owners preferred topical fluralaner over the monthly flea and tick products they had used.</Abstract><Abstract>The extended dosing interval of up to 12 weeks was the leading preference factor and the key driver of user satisfaction with fluralaner leading to improved adherence to redosing recommendations. Cat owners said they were more likely to administer fluralaner at the recommended redosing interval compared to monthly products, indicating that less frequent redosing contributes to improved adherence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Topical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flea Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insecticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoxazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medication Adherence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Personal Satisfaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tick Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Reduction and stabilization of these fractures can sometimes be achieved through closed reduction, primarily in fractures that are nominally displaced. Circular external fixator constructs have been used to assist in indirect, closed reduction of fractures at other anatomic locations in dogs and this report describes application of this method to reduce a displaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the distal femur in a 1-year-old dog.</Abstract><Abstract>A 1-year-old female spayed Akita was referred for treatment of a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the right distal femur. The epiphyseal segment was laterally and slightly caudally displaced. Multiple attempts to manually reduce the fracture during surgery were unsuccessful, so a two-ring circular external fixator construct was applied to facilitate distraction and reduction. The construct was applied by placing a medial-to-lateral Kirschner wire in both the mid-femoral diaphysis and in the distal femoral epiphysis. Distraction of the construct provided sufficient separation of the fracture segments to facilitate near anatomic reduction. The fracture was stabilized with two percutaneously placed Steinmann pins placed in Rush fashion. Radiographic union was confirmed 5 weeks after surgery. The dog was not lame and was bearing more weight on the right pelvic limb, as assessed using force plate analysis, 9 months following surgery. Goniometric measurements of stifle range of motion and thigh muscle circumference were similar between the pelvic limbs.</Abstract><Abstract>Application of a two-ring circular construct would appear to be useful to facilitate closed reduction and percutaneous stabilization of distal femoral physeal fractures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>External Fixators</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Femoral Fractures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fracture Fixation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Closed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Growth Plate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Each dog received 20 mg/m[2] of bleomycin intravenously. Based on the clinician's decision, the primary tumor or tumor bed was also infiltrated with cisplatin at the dose of 0.5 mg/cm[2]. Trains of permeabilizing biphasic electric pulses were then applied under general anesthesia.</Abstract><Abstract>Ten dogs were enrolled in the study. Of those 10 dogs, only one received ECT for treatment of microscopic local disease, while in six cases ECT was the only treatment modality. In three dogs, ECT was followed by systemic medical treatment. Six dogs (60%) had a partial response (PR), three dogs (30%) had stable disease, and one dog treated for microscopic disease did not show any sign of local relapse for 305 days after treatment, being still alive and in complete remission at the time of writing this article. The median time to progression was 303 days and the median survival time was 365 days. The treatment was well tolerated and local side effects were minimal.

The rat was found dead on a street in the chief town of Marseille (France) after being run over by a car. The necropsy of the corpse revealed generalized granulomatous pneumonia in almost all the pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions and predominantly multiple fibro-inflammatory areas are presumably the witness of an infectious etiology. Bacterial isolation was carried out from lung tissues. Colonies were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The following bacteria were identified: Staphylococcus cohnii, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussi, Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum, Pelistega suis and Rodentibacter rarus.

MSCs therapy is based on their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory (immunosuppressive), and regenerative potential. This review aims to provide a clinical overview of the MSCs potential as a therapeutic option for orthopedic diseases in dogs. A total of 25 clinical studies published in the scientific literature in the last 15 years on various diseases will be presented: semitendinosus myopathy, supraspinatus tendinopathy, cruciate ligament rupture, bone fractures and defects, and also osteoarthritis (OA). All articles involved in this study include only diseases that have naturally occurred in canine patients. MSCs therapy in the veterinary orthopedic field has great potential, especially for OA. All studies presented promising results. However, MSCs bone healing capacity did not reveal such favorable outcomes in the long term. Besides, most of these clinical studies did not include immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and histopathology to confirm that MSCs have differentiated and incorporated into the injured tissues. This review summarizes the current knowledge of canine MSCs biology, immunology, and clinical application in canine orthopedic diseases. Despite the positive results in its use, there is still a lack of defined protocols, heterogeneous samples, and concomitant medications used with MSCs therapy compromising therapeutic effects. Further studies are needed in the hope of overcoming its limitation in upcoming trials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Differentiation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mesenchymal Stem Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Musculoskeletal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Originally based on principles derived from centuries of observation, conventional scientific mechanisms of action for acupuncture as a pain-relieving modality have recently been elucidated. Acupuncture points allow access to multiple regions of the body via the peripheral nervous system and its connection with the central nervous system. Local, segmental (spinal), and suprasegmental (brain) effects of acupuncture involve enhanced release of pain-relieving endogenous substances (e.g., opioids) and mitigated release of pain-inducing substances (e.g., inflammatory cytokines). In addition, there is evidence that acupuncture can induce positive neurochemical and cytoarchitectural change in the central nervous system via the phenomenon of neuroplasticity. Electroacupuncture is considered the most effective type of acupuncture delivery, allowing for more potent and long-lasting pain relief than is achieved via other methods (e.g., dry needling). The purpose of this review article is to summarize the relevant scientific literature from the last two decades relating to the physiological mechanisms of action of acupuncture as a pain-relieving modality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acupuncture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Acupuncture Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroacupuncture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Management</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is theorized that the chronic inflammatory condition characteristic of oral dysbiosis in patients with periodontal disease leads to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, cytotoxin- and pathogen-induced brain damage, and accumulation of neurotoxic &#946;-amyloid. In this inflammatory theory of Alzheimer's disease, &#946;-amyloid-a known antimicrobial protein-accumulates in response to oral pathogens. Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is considered a naturally occurring animal model of human Alzheimer's disease. Like humans, periodontal disease is quite common in dogs; however, a link between periodontal disease and cognitive dysfunction has not been identified in this species.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this prospective investigation was to compare visual periodontal scores (from digital oral photographs) with numerical (0-54) cognitive assessment questionnaire forms in aging dogs with and without a clinical diagnosis of CCD.</Abstract><Abstract>A visual analogue scale (0-4) was used to score the severity of periodontal disease in 21 aging dogs: 11 dogs with a clinical diagnosis of presumptive CCD and 10 dogs without a clinical history of cognitive decline. Individuals scoring the dental photographs were blinded to all case information, including cognitive assessment scores. Cognitive assessment scores were compared with periodontal disease scores for all dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) association between periodontal and cognitive scores, with higher cognitive impairment scores being more likely in dogs with more severe periodontal disease and vice versa. No associations were identified between age and either periodontal disease or cognitive impairment.</Abstract><Abstract>Although a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontal disease and cognitive impairment cannot be ascertained from this preliminary study, we established a link between these two disorders that warrants further investigation using more stringent criteria for evaluating both periodontal disease and cognitive dysfunction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cognition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cognitive Dysfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Periodontitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It also compared the therapeutic efficacy of piperazine citrate as an oral anthelmintic drug and Doramectin as an injectable one.</Abstract><Abstract>The study was conducted on 40 donkeys naturally infected with Strongylus spp. These donkeys were divided into two groups (20 donkeys each) according to treatment; One group was treated with piperazine citrate (PipTG) and the other with doramectin (DoraTG). Thorough clinical examination, hematological, biochemical, and parasitological assays were performed before (Day 0) and after treatment (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28). All data were statistically analyzed by independent-sample t-test or paired t-test.</Abstract><Abstract>In both groups, mean values of MDA were significantly reduced, while those of TAC were significantly elevated after treatment on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. These significant changes were reported after treatment between PipTG and DoraTG in favor of DoraTG. Serum concentrations of MDA were significantly reduced, while those of TAC were significantly elevated for DoraTG treatment group when their values were compared with those of PipTG either on days 7, 14, 21, or 28. Significant correlations were reported in PipTG and DoraTG. Negative significant correlations were reported between fecal egg count (FEC) and each of whole blood picture indices (RBCS, Hb, and PCV), serum TAC and faecal egg count reduction percentage FECR%. A positive correlation was seen between FEC and MDA. MDA exhibited a negative correlation with both blood picture and TAC; hence, TAC was positively correlated with these blood picture indices in both PipTG and DoraTG. In PipTG, anthelmintic resistance (R) was present on days 7 and 14, while it was suspected (S) at day 21 then it was absent (N) at day 28. In DoraTG, anthelmintic resistance was suspected (S) on day 7, then it became absent (N) on days 14, 21, and 28 post therapy.</Abstract><Abstract>The immunological status of the infected donkeys had greatly improved after treatment.

In the assay, a tetrazolium component (MTT) is converted into MTT formazan by some specific enzymes in the viable cells. The amount of formazan product in theory is directly correlated with the percentage of viable sperms. It is quantified by measuring the absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The present article compiles the MTT assays that have been used to determine sperm viability in most animal species and humans. In each assay, other factors apart from the number of viable cells that potentially influence the accuracy and precision of results are stated, such as preparations of sperm and MTT solutions, length and conditions of incubation, and a solubilizing agent as well as the formazan detection method. Also, the strengths and shortcomings of the MTT test comparison with the others are summarized at the end of this article.

This case series describes the clinical course, etiology, and outcome of five dogs with persistent pneumothorax treated with ABP.</Abstract><Abstract>Five client-owned dogs with persistent pneumothorax are presented. Two dogs had pneumothorax due to congenital pulmonary bullae, one due to thoracic trauma, another due to lungworm infection, and a fifth with unknown cause in the context of a relapsing subcutaneous haemangiosarcoma. Around 5 ml/kg of non-coagulated blood was aseptically collected from the jugular vein and injected via a thoracotomy tube immediately into the pleural cavity of dogs with persistent pneumothorax. The procedure was successful in four out of five dogs after one procedure, therefore a success rate of 80%. A repeat of the pleurodesis was attempted in the fifth dog, 12 hours after the first injection due to the recollection of the pneumothorax. Still, the dog died during anesthesia in preparation for the procedure. No complications that could be directly linked to ABP occurred.</Abstract><Abstract>ABP is a simple, rapid, inexpensive, effective, and safe procedure that can be useful for treating persistent pneumothorax that does not respond to conservative treatment and where surgical exploration cannot be carried out.

The study is expected to provide enriching information regarding recognizable clinical signs in the field that can lead to the diagnosis of streptococcosis caused by E. faecalis, especially in the Indonesian aquaculture environment.</Abstract><Abstract>The method used in this artificial infection study using red tilapia, which were divided into two types of route groups infection, namely intraperitoneal (IP) and peroral (PO) with bacterial concentrations given for each route of infection to be 2.1 &#215; 10[8] CFU ml[-1]; 2.1 &#215; 10[7] CFU ml[-][1]; and 2.1 &#215; 10[6] CFU ml[-1]. One group was given brain heart infusion broth media sterile as a non-infectious control. Clinical symptoms, changes in swimming habits and consuming feed, external and internal organ lesion, and leukocytes profile changes were observed during the observation period along 14 days to evaluate the infectious effect of each treated fish group. The lethal dose 50 (LD[50]) was estimated with the Spearman-K&#228;rber method. The evaluation of the leukocyte profile was performed to find leukocytosis as the clinical sign of infection.</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed variations in clinical symptoms inflicted on fish through death or the moribund stage. The highest mortality occurred in the treatment group of 2.1 &#215; 10[8] CFU ml[-1] with the PO route. The bacterial concentration of 2.1 &#215; 10[7] CFU ml[-1] given either as PO or IP can cause mild infection symptoms but did not cause mortality. The LD50 of the PO and IP route was obtained at 1.99 &#215; 10[8] CFU ml[-1] and 0.79 &#215; 10[8] CFU ml[-1], respectively. The total leukocytes in the infected fish group increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by twofold when compared with the non-infectious group.

The swelling on the left ear which was located at the convex surface was soft, painless, and fluid-filled, suggestive of aural hematoma located at the convex surface. The right pinna was swollen, bleeding, and extremely painful at palpation. The skin was necrotized at the distal 2/3rd of the convex surface and the 1/2 of the concave surface. Underneath the necrotized skin of the convex surface, blood, and blood clots were trapped, and there was a pocket between the remaining normal skin and the cartilage indicating possible rupture of aural hematoma. The kid was surgically treated under general anesthesia with xylazine and ketamine. The aural hematoma was drained by the convex surface using a Penrose tube after flushing the cavity with 2 mg dexamethasone. The trauma of the right pinna was left to heal by secondary intention after resection of all necrotized, edematous tissues, and blood clots. Post-surgery, the animal was treated with parenteral antibiotic administration and daily application of a topical antiseptic solution. The Penrose tube was removed after 5 days, and the animal recovered uneventfully.</Abstract><Abstract>The present case indicates that aural hematoma can occur in newborn goat kids secondary to ear pinna biting and might evolve to pinna necrosis.

However, many programs fail to maintain viable ex situ populations due to reproductive problems, including dystocia in pregnant females. Dystocia encompasses different emergency obstetric situations for the lives of dams and fetuses that require urgent intervention. This condition has been studied in domesticated species but published records in wildlife, specifically in felines species, are scarce.</Abstract><Abstract>An adult female ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) was referred to the wildlife hospital of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito after being attacked by dogs (Canis familiaris). Neurological tests revealed traumatic spinal cord injury at a thoracolumbar level. Complementary tests (laboratory exams, radiographs, and ultrasound) revealed a full-term pregnancy, failure in the labor progress, and critical fetal stress. A cesarean section was performed, and the newborns received resuscitation care after assessing their viability using the Apgar score system. The neonate with the lowest Apgar score died within the first hour after birth, while the second one showed an increase in Apgar score after resuscitation care and survived the procedure.</Abstract><Abstract>We provide new obstetric data that could be relevant to save the lives of dams and newborns in related cases for ocelots and other species of wild felids.

Acquired MG is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (ACHRs). ACHRs antibodies are the most commonly formed, but the production of antistriational antibodies binding to skeletal and cardiac muscle proteins has also been recorded both in humans and dogs. An association between the occurrence of antistriational antibodies and a severe form of myocarditis, giant cell myocarditis, has been described in humans.</Abstract><Abstract>A 4-year-old mixed-breed dog was referred because of 1 month history of exercise-induced weakness, hypersalivation, and regurgitation. The neurologic examination was indicative of a neuromuscular junction disease, and MG was suspected. A computed tomographic scan examination showed the presence of a megaoesophagus and a thymic mass. Serum antibodies against ACHRs confirmed the diagnosis of MG. Treatment with pyridostigmine was started, and the thymic mass was surgically excised, and a diagnosis of thymoma was confirmed by histology. 24 hours after surgery, the dog developed a third-degree atrioventricular block. Severe arrhythmia and increased troponin serum levels suggested myocarditis which rapidly led to cardiopulmonary arrest. Histopathologic examination of the heart, esophagus and diaphragm revealed a lymphocytic and macrophagic infiltration, consistent with myocarditis and polymyositis. Scattered rare giant multinucleated cells were also detected in the myocardium.</Abstract><Abstract>To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of thymoma-associated MG with concurrent polymyositis and giant cell-like myocarditis in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myasthenia Gravis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myocarditis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymyositis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bilateral hypermature cataracts were diagnosed. A-scan biometry was carried out to calculate the intraocular lens' (IOL) diopter power. Bilateral cataract extraction by lens aspiration with +17.5 diopter foldable IOL implantation was successfully completed. Two months after surgery, the black kite navigated well and could fly and catch his food.

The disease has been detected in some countries since 1980, which rapidly spread worldwide later on. Ornithobacteriosis can transmit either horizontally or even vertically. Infection with ORT is mainly characterized by respiratory distress, poor performance, acute death, and a drop in egg production. However, the most characteristic necropsy lesions of dead turkeys and chickens are yoghurt like airsacculitis and pneumonia, usually unilateral. Unfortunately, infection with ORT was misdiagnosed in most of the poultry flocks due to similarity with other respiratory pathogens and the lack of the ideal protocols for diagnosis. Recently, some molecular and serological techniques have been used to detect the infection. Treatment of ORT with antibiotics is very difficult and variable as a result of acquired resistance. Many vaccines have been developed to counteract such infection in broiler, layers, and breeder chicken and turkey flocks. Inactivated, live, and sub-unit vaccines have been used with satisfactory results. Thus, this review paper aimed to address ornithobacteriosis, emphasizing the distribution, transmission, clinical picture, diagnosis, and disease control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkeys</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Molecular analysis which emphasizes on hexon and fiber proteins is currently the major focus of curiosity for FAdV antigenicity and pathogenicity. Recently, disease outbreaks associated with FAdV infections such as inclusion body hepatitis, hepatitis hydropericardium syndrome, and gizzard erosion, were commonly reported and continue to increase worldwide. Studies on the virulence gene of the virus were intensively conducted to provide a better understanding on the role of these major capsid proteins in the development of a safe and effective vaccine against the disease in the poultry industry. This paper highlights the variations of the fiber and hexon genes, their importance in genotypes and serotypes differentiation, and infectivity between FAdV strains. It appears that the L1 loop of hexon and the knob of fiber genes are the infectivity markers for FAdV infection. The fiber-2 protein plays a major role in FAdV pathogenicity than the hexon protein, while the fiber-1 protein is important for viral replication and assembly, regardless of virulence capability instead of infectivity. The hexon protein plays a major role in virus infectivity and tissue tropism. These findings could further enhance the knowledge of FAdV strains' classification and evolution, diagnosis, and strategies to prevent and control FAdV infection and outbreaks in chicken farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aviadenovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virus Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Variables related to energy and hormone metabolism were analyzed. Four proposed indexes were calculated to identify insulin resistance: Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA), Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), Revised Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index, and QUICKI-BHB. Through linear regression, the effect of metabolites and hormones on the indexes of insulin resistance studied was estimated.</Abstract><Abstract>The groups with supplementation did not show significant changes in the mobilization of body reserves, NEFA, or triiodothyronine for interaction between treatments and periods.

Chronically, it leads to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) which is an accurate marker for autonomic balance. More than two decades ago in human medicine an indicator of autonomic balance that happens after a premature ventricular beat, it was described as heart rate turbulence (HRT). In humans with ischemic heart disease, the absence of HRT has proven to be a more accurate and an independent indicator of mortality than known HRV parameters. Currently, there are very few studies of HRT in dogs and it is still not tested in small dogs within different stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this study was to assess the HRT indicators, onset and slope, in small dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease and to statistically test it.</Abstract><Abstract>Dogs under 25 kg had electrocardiogram and echocardiography performed and, in some patients, holter monitoring was carried out. Data were divided into groups B1, B2, C, and D for mean comparison with analysis of variance and Tukey test. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for differentiating among symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and for differentiating between remodeled and non-remodeled hearts. The Pearson was executed after correlations of turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) with commonly used echocardiographic parameters.</Abstract><Abstract>Variance analyses held significant differences in TO and TS between stages B1 from stages C and D, while B2 held similarity to the other groups. In the receiver operating curve was found a very good area under the curve for differentiating among symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and remodeled and non-remodeled dogs. Few echocardiography parameters held weak correlation with TO while others held weak to moderate correlation with TS.</Abstract><Abstract>In dogs with MMVD and without other diseases, HRT is a feasible indicator for autonomic balance. Our result suggests HRT changes as the MMVD progresses and congestive heart failure is present. More studies with HRT are needed.

On physical examination, a penetrating wound of small dimension was detected at the medial aspect of the right hindlimb. After radiographic examination, a complete diaphyseal fracture with slight obliquity of the right Mt3 was confirmed. The owner opted for surgical repair thus fracture stabilization was achieved by the placement of just a single 8-hole 4.5 mm broad dynamic compression plate applied to the lateral face of Mt3 in compression function with 7 cortical screws (4.5 mm). Post-operatively a full limb cast was performed and maintained for 4 weeks, while the animal was kept under movement limitation at the hospital facilities for this period of time although the animal stayed until his full recovery 3 months' post-surgery.</Abstract><Abstract>A complete recovery was achieved and the animal returned to the previous level of exercise without any significant postoperative complications or degree of lameness.

Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chlorantha Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) was evaluated using the larval form of GM. The median lethal doses (LD50), 90% (LD90), and 100% (LD100) were determined using the spline cubic survival curves and equations from the data obtained on the survival rate of GM 24 hours after the injection with the extracts.</Abstract><Abstract>We found that distilled water extracted a more important mass of phytochemical compounds (7.4%-21.2%) compared to ethanolic solution (5.8%-12.4%). LD varied depending on the plant materials and ethanolic extracts (hydroalcoholic extract, (HAE)) were more toxic to GM than aqueous ones. The LD50 (mg/ml) of the tested extracts varied from 4.87 [3.90 g/kg body weight (bw)] to &gt;200 (&gt; 166.67 g/kg bw), the LD90 (mg/ml) from 25.00 (18.52 g/kg bw) to &gt;200 (&gt; 181.82 g/kg bw) and LD100 (mg/ml) from 45.00 (40.91 g/kg bw) to &gt; 200 (&gt;181.82 g/kg bw). The HAE of A. indica seed and C. officinalis bark exhibited the highest toxicity with LD50 (g/kg bw) of 3.90 and 4.81, respectively.</Abstract><Abstract>The results obtained in this study suggest that GM can be used as a sensitive, reliable, and robust eco-friendly model to gauge the toxicity of medicinal plants. Thus, avoid the sacrifice of vertebrate models often used for this purpose to limit ethical concerns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cameroon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Larva</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Moths</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Leaves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plants, Medicinal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Nowadays, the elective treatment of FAC is based on the progesterone antagonist aglepristone. This study aimed to report the treatment of FAC with a combination of drugs designed to preserve mammary gland integrity, even in pregnant cats.</Abstract><Abstract>Eight sexually intact female cats with FAC showed mammary glands that were symmetrically enlarged and inflamed in all cases, and the skin was ulcerated in six cats. Four cats were on days 25-32 of pregnancy at presentation. Non-pregnant cats were treated with aglepristone and with a dietary supplement containing maltodextrin and bromelain. The mammary glands were massaged daily with an Aloe vera emollient gel. If the gland was inflamed or ulcerated, broad-spectrum antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory treatments were given, and the ulcers were treated topically with a hypericum and neem-based cream. Two of the four pregnant cats were treated with the same therapeutic schedule plus cloprostenol to facilitate uterine emptying. Two pregnant cats underwent the same protocol except for aglepristone, which was not administered to safeguard the litter and see if the adjuvant therapy worked independently. At term, they delivered four and three kittens, respectively, that were normally nursed and weaned after 40 days. In all the studied cases, the mammary gland reduced in size 2-3 weeks after the start of the treatment and completely remitted after 4-5 weeks.</Abstract><Abstract>This case series encourages adjuvant therapy in the course of FAC to preserve mammary gland integrity and functionality. Exploiting the natural decline of progesterone at the end of pregnancy (or pseudopregnancy), the therapy may also be used without aglepristone, when its use has other limitations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Conservative Treatment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs in groups 1, 2, and 3 were subjected to facial nerve neurectomy and saphenous vein conduit graft implantation at the site of facial nerve injury. Dogs in groups 2 and 3 received 1 ml of autologous PRP and BM-MSCs, respectively. Injections were administered directly in the vein conduit immediately after nerve injury. Dogs in group 1 (grafted but not treated; control) received only an autologous vein graft, and those in group 4 (normal control) received no graft and no PRP or BM-MSCs treatment. The dogs were monitored daily for 8 weeks after surgery. Clinical evaluation of the facial nerve, including lower eyelid, ear drooping, upper lip, and tongue functions, was carried out once per week using a numerical scoring system of 0-3. At the end of the study period (week 8), the facial nerve injury site was evaluated grossly for the presence of adhesions using a numerical scoring system of 0-3. The facial nerve injury site was histopathologically assessed for the existence of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, fibrous tissue deposition, and axonal injury using H&amp;E-stained tissue sections.</Abstract><Abstract>Clinically, BM-MSCs treated dogs experienced significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement in the lower eyelid, ear, lip, and tongue functions 4 weeks postoperatively compared to other groups.

All the cats were assigned to the study as being both clinically and ophthalmologically healthy. For the SM test, the tip of the strip was used to evaluate the meniscus without touching the eyelid or the cornea for 5 seconds. After a full tear washout period of 10 minutes, the STT was performed using a standard STT strip.</Abstract><Abstract>In the right eyes, the mean &#177; standard deviation (SD) of SM was 4.32 &#177; 2.27 mm/5 seconds, and in the left eyes it was 5.04 &#177; 2.24 mm/5 seconds (for both eyes combined: 4.68 &#177; 2.26 mm/5 seconds), with a median of 4 in both eyes; the reference values ranged from 4.04 to 5.32 mm/5 seconds. No significant differences were recorded in the SM between the right and left eyes of the cats when using the SM (p &gt; 0.05). When the STT was used, the mean &#177; SD for the cats' right eyes was 12.16 &#177; 4.04 mm/minute, and for the left eyes, it was 12.76 &#177; 4.1 mm/minute (for both eyes combined: 12.46 &#177; 4.20 mm/minute), with a median of 13.50 for both eyes.

The causative agent, prion, is a misfolded isoform of normal cellular prion protein, which is found in cells with higher concentration in the central nervous system. This review explored the sources of infection and different natural transmission routes of animal prion diseases in susceptible populations. Chronic wasting disease in cervids and scrapie in small ruminants are prion diseases capable of maintaining themselves in susceptible populations through horizontal and vertical transmission. The other prion animal diseases can only be transmitted through food contaminated with prions. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is the only animal prion disease considered zoonotic. However, due to its inability to transmit within a population, it could be controlled. The emergence of atypical cases of scrapie and BSE, even the recent report of prion disease in camels, demonstrates the importance of understanding the transmission routes of prion diseases to take measures to control them and to assess the risks to human and animal health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Susceptibility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Encephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prion Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prions</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scrapie</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this report, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections associated with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) is reported. However, there have been no reports on the treatment of MRSA infection following TPLO in dogs. This case report describes the use of a combination of vancomycin and rifampicin to treat MRSA infection following TPLO in a dog.</Abstract><Abstract>A 7-year-old spayed female American cocker spaniel was referred for right hind limb lameness that did not improve with conservative treatment. The dog was diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, for which TPLO was performed. Once the surgical wound was closed, the dog licked the skin on the surgical site, causing the injury to dehisce. MRSA was detected from the purulent discharge, and chloramphenicol was then administered based on the drug sensitivity test results. Because of the continued drainage, the implants were removed after the bone union of the osteotomy site was observed. Since this did not provide any relief to the existing condition, the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin at 132 days after TPLO surgery, and the infected location was cleaned many times through a drain tube placed into the tibia. However, the infection could not be controlled. Thus, a rifampicin and vancomycin combination was started. As a result, the purulent discharge disappeared and the fistula entirely closed on the 154th day after TPLO surgery.</Abstract><Abstract>A combination of rifampicin and vancomycin may be effective for treating MRSA infection at the surgical site following TPLO surgery that does not heal despite implant removal and administration of vancomycin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rifampin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vancomycin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Many studies have noted that LPS do their action through activation of CD14/ TLR4 pathways, which occur mainly in liver cells, including Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are responsible for cytokines releases and shows the good or bad LPS effect.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study aimed to disclose the expression changes in the profile of innate immunological receptors TLR4 and CD14 in rats' livers after stimulation with LPS.</Abstract><Abstract>Ten groups of male Wistar albino rats were used to study the effects of two types of LPS [extracted LPS from the local strain of Escherichia coli (ELPS) and standard E. coli (SLPS)]; these were given by using different doses (5 mg/kg and 100 &#956;g/kg); the LPS were injected either intravenously or intraperitoneally. The TLR4 and CD14 mRNA expression patterns were estimated using qPCR after 6, 12, and 24 hours postinjection.</Abstract><Abstract>The results show that there is a negative effect of ELPS on liver CD14 and TLR4, regardless of the dose and route of administration. On the other hand, the SLPS has an upregulatory impact on the liver gene expression. Also, different times show no effect on the gene expression of the two genes.</Abstract><Abstract>This study concludes that both LPS types used were able to stimulate the CD14 and TLR4 gene expression in the liver in different doses and routes of injection.

Therefore, recent research has resorted to finding cheap natural sources as alternatives to traditional feed and antibiotics.</Abstract><Abstract>The experiment was conducted to study the effects of sea buckthorn fruit residues meal on broilers' performance and skin pigmentation.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 700 broiler chicks (ROSS 308) were allotted into two groups, and each group comprises 350 birds divided into 10 replicants, 35 birds to each replicant. The experimental group was fed diets where 15% of the wheat was replaced by sea buckthorn residues meal. The control group was fed diets without any color additive. Feed and water were provided ad-libitum.</Abstract><Abstract>The sea buckthorn fruit residues contained 21% crude protein and metabolisable energy calculated was 9.88 MJ/kg. The live body weight was significantly lower than the experimental group (p &lt; 0.05) on days 14 and 28. The feed conversion ratio was significantly poorer in the experimental group compared with the control group on days 35 of age (p &lt; 0.05). The mortality was higher in the experimental group than in the control group. The DSM Broiler Fan assessed skin color. The skin of the broilers was significantly more yellowish in the experimental group than the control group (103.08 vs. 102.38 scales). The pigmentation of the skin was higher in males than females.</Abstract><Abstract>The use of sea buckthorn residues in poultry feeding negatively affected the overall performance rate. Mightily, its use in diets depends mainly on the price of feed ingredients. Thus, improving the skin color and biological value of broiler meat can determine its usefulness in broiler feed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fruit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hippophae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Pigmentation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triticum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We collected bursas of Fabricius for virus assays and histopathology. Samples positive in the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test were inoculated onto chicken embryo fibroblast cell culture and embryonated chicken eggs. Twenty-two-day-old chicks were infected experimentally with three selected isolates, and morbidity and mortality rates were compared.</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed that 70% of outbreaks occurred between 6 and 8 weeks of age, and the mean mortality rate was 51%. Epidemiologic, clinical, gross, and histopathological findings were characteristic of the severe disease caused by the very virulent IBDvirus (vvIBDV). The farms that used intermediate or the intermediate plus vaccines had lowered mortality compared with the farms that used intermediate vaccines. The AGID was found more sensitive than the counter-immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP) since it detected 83.4% of the IBDV antigen in the samples while the CIEP detected 66.7% of the samples.

Cases were defined as animals presented for consultation with strong evidence of current, or recent heat induced illness during the study period (2013-2018).</Abstract><Abstract>The HRI cases included 146 dogs, 16 cats, 8 guinea pigs, 3 rabbits and 1 ferret. Of the 118 HRI cases with a recorded trigger, exercise was the primary trigger for dogs presenting (73.5%); 7 (6.9%) canine HRI events followed vehicular confinement. Environmental HRI was recorded as a trigger for the remaining dogs (19.6%), and for all cats, guinea pigs, rabbits and the ferret. Brachycephalic breeds comprised 21.2% of canine HRI cases, and all rabbits were brachycephalic breeds. Dogs with HRI were presented between April and October, with 42.5% during July, typically the UK's hottest month of the year. Cats with HRI were presented between May and September, with 75.0% during June and July. The smaller companion species-ferrets, rabbits and guinea pigs-were presented during the UK's summer months June to August.</Abstract><Abstract>This study highlights the risk of HRI to all pet animals during the UK's warmer summer months (June to August). The findings support previous claims that exercise is the most common trigger of HRI in dogs, while environmental HRI (a hot ambient temperature) accounted for all HRI events in cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Both brachycephalic dogs and rabbits were overrepresented, adding further evidence that owners of these animals should be particularly vigilant for HRI during hot weather.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferrets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Guinea Pigs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hot Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United Kingdom</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although endoscopic balloon dilation is still the first-line therapy, refractory or recurrent strictures do occur and remain a challenge to the endoluminal treatment. The aim of this report was to communicate a recurrent esophageal stricture resolution in a cat treated with balloon dilatation and steroid injections in Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.</Abstract><Abstract>A 1-year-old spayed mix-breed female cat was consulted to the Veterinary Endoscopy Service for recurring regurgitation after two previous esophageal dilations. The cat had received doxycycline for Mycoplasma spp. infection and 20 days after the treatment consulted for dysphagia and regurgitation. Upper esophagogastroscopy (UGE) was performed with an Olympus CV-160 8.7 mm diameter endoscope; an annular 7 mm stricture was observed 3 cm caudal to the cranial esophagus sphincter. Three balloon dilatations procedures were performed with a Boston Scientific Controlled Radial Expansion (CRE) balloon 8-10-12 mm of 1 minute each. Because of ongoing clinical signs, another UGE was performed 15 days from the first procedure: a 3 mm stricture was encountered, balloon dilatation was repeated with 6-10-12 mm diameter, and a four-quadrant triamcinolone was injected in the submucosa. Clinically, the cat could eat with no alterations until day 20, where it started with mild dysphagia. Another UGE was performed, and the known stricture conserved a 11 mm diameter and balloon dilatation 12-15-16.5 mm with triamcinolone injection was repeated 30 days after the previous procedure. The cat could eat kibbles with no clinical signs in an 11-month follow-up.</Abstract><Abstract>The alternative to triamcinolone injection after balloon dilatation presented in this clinical report was successful and it could be a therapeutic option for recurrent esophageal strictures in cats as it is in human medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Constriction, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deglutition Disorders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Stenosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophagoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intralesional</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Steroids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triamcinolone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

L-theanine is the most common nonprotein amino acid and is soluble in water. Theanine can be found in some plants, such as green tea and some mushrooms. Under stress conditions, theanine is proposed to be a naturally effective additive in preventing reactive oxygen species, thus reducing oxidative stress. In addition, as an immune booster in animal bodies, L-theanine can be applied in the diet to help animals improve their performance, especially their immunity during stress conditions. The digestion of L-theanine improves &#947;&#948; T cell growth and development. Thus, it is considered an essential compound in boosting the immune function. Moreover, the immune function of L-theanine is also shown in immune-related organs through increasing their weights. Theanine seems to be widely used in pigs, mice, and humans. However, the study of theanine in poultry species is scarce. Therefore, to fill the knowledge gap regarding the use of theanine in enhancing poultry immunity, this study aims to synthesize all information on the application of theanine in poultry, focusing on its immune-boosting role.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amino Acids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glutamates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Some techniques, such as the massive sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, have made it possible to obtain information about the abundance and functionality of the microorganisms that compose the equine gut microbiome and the interaction with their environment. Recent studies have identified the change in the composition of the intestinal microbiome during and after a colic episode, although is not clear if it is a cause or a consequence. The objective of this review was to elucidate whether there is a direct relationship between the changes that occur in the gut microbiome and colic in the equine. A systematized search in Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed was realized. Although there is good evidence that horses with colic have a change in their gut microbiome, it is not fully understood whether these changes are causes or effects. It is necessary to delve into this topic, considering studying larger population sizes. In addition, it would be of great value to previously know the normal intestinal microbiome of a group of healthy horses, which in the future could develop an episode of colic, to compare the before and after in the same individual.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Microbiome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It works as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is encoded in the NLRP3 gene. This protein is profoundly expressed in macrophage and other innate immune system cells, and participates in the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase-1, which in turn renders the inactive precursors of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, the interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;) and the IL-18, into active forms. This cytokine may trigger many inflammatory responses and cell signaling pathways as well. Little is known about this cytokine in chickens, especially its role in vaccines or induced immune responses.</Abstract><Abstract>In this article, we sought to determine the presence of this gene mRNA in selected organs of male and female commercial, brown leghorn egg-type chickens. In addition, we sought to determine this gene's potential expression in these organs upon stimulation.</Abstract><Abstract>Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, first we tested the presence of the NLRP3 gene in the chickens. Second, the levels and the time course of NLRP3 gene expression have been tested after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 12, 24, and 48 hours postinoculation (pi). One-hundred twenty, day-old males and females egg-type brown leghorn chickens were used for the study.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results showed that the gene mRNA is actually present in chickens solely. Also, there were no significant differences in the density of the expression and the distribution of the expression of the NLRP3 between male and female chickens and among different organs. Upon stimulation with LPS administration, however, there were marked elevations in the gene expression rates in small intestine, large intestine, gizzard, liver, lung, spleen, and Peyer's patches 12 hours pi. This elevation continued to elevate 24 hours pi. However, the significance of the expression was only recorded in the small intestine, large intestine, and with less significance, in Peyer's patches and spleen. This elevation in expression subsided and almost returned to normal within these organs 48 hours pi.</Abstract><Abstract>The results suggest that there were no significant differences in the NLRP3 gene expression between male and female. Upon stimulation, the course of the gene expression showed a time-dependent response. First, the dominance in the NLRP3 gene mRNA expression was in the small intestine and gizzard. Similarly, but less profoundly, the large intestine, Peyer's patches, and spleen expressed NLRP3 mRNA 12 and 24 hours pi with LPS. Secondary immune organs, lungs, small intestine, and large intestine expressed the NLRP3 mRNA significantly 24 hours pi.

CCD is considered a naturally occurring model of human AD. Transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBMT), also known as transcranial laser therapy, entails delivering photons of near infrared to infrared light from the skin surface of the scalp to the underlying brain. Specific molecular cellular receptors, called chromophores, absorb this energy, and use it to initiate biological reactions with potential therapeutic benefit. Improvement in cognitive ability using tPBMT has been documented in rodent AD models and human clinical trials. The purposes of this review are to provide an overview of the suspected molecular mechanisms of action of tPBMT for the treatment of cognitive decline and to propose potential application of this treatment modality for dogs affected by CCD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Alzheimer Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cognitive Dysfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laser Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lasers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Low-Level Light Therapy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, the buyer is protected by law if the purchased animal should be affected by defects such as an illness or a congenital / hereditary condition that depreciates its value. In the sale of animals, a disease is legally considered a defect if it is hidden, severe, and pre-existing at the time of purchase. Canine Atopic Dermatitis (CAD) having these three requirements can, therefore, legally be considered a defect. To acquire his legal rights, the buyer must obtain a certification from the veterinarian reporting that the animal was unfit for buying within a certain time frame.</Abstract><Abstract>This paper analyzes the legal choices that owners of dogs affected with CAD can make to help practicing veterinary clinicians comprehend and recognize this disease and because it may be considered a defect.</Abstract><Abstract>Thirteen cases of CAD are reported and analyzed from a medico-legal point of view.</Abstract><Abstract>In cases n. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 owners of dogs affected with CAD partial or full reimbursement from the seller obtained.

We experienced that surgical treatment with postoperative radiation therapy for spinal nephroblastoma in a dog resulted in the long-term survival of 11 years.</Abstract><Abstract>The patient presented to our veterinary hospital because of progressive hindlimb paralysis. Based on diagnostic imaging, she was diagnosed with a thoracolumbar spinal cord tumor and was treated with surgery. The gross tumor tissue was removed after laminectomy, followed by postoperative radiation therapy using orthovoltage equipment. The histopathological features of the surgical specimen were consistent with those of previously reported spinal nephroblastoma, although infrequent mitotic figures were observed. The dog recovered well after treatment and resumed her normal walking condition. No tumor recurrence was observed on periodic follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 10 and 21 months after surgery. Imaging evaluation for the gradual development of hindlimb weakness was performed 9 years after surgery; however, no recurrence of tumor tissue was observed, and spondylosis deformans, probably induced after laminectomy, were identified as a possible cause. The dog died of aspiration pneumonia 11 years after surgery, independent of spinal nephroblastoma.</Abstract><Abstract>To date, no clinical cases of canine spinal cord primary nephroblastoma that survived for 11 years after surgery have been reported.

On clinical examination, the patient showed depression, right head tilt, left-sided facial paralysis, and horizontal nystagmus with fast phase to the left. The magnetic resonance images showed a voluminous extra-axial lesion, with irregular morphology and well-defined margins, with intracranial extension in the region of the pons, rostral medulla oblongata, cerebellar vermis, floccule, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Due to progressive clinical deterioration, the cat was euthanized 2 weeks later. A necropsy was then performed and histological samples were taken. The necropsy revealed the presence of a voluminous dark red irregular mass extending from the tympanic bulla to the posterior cranial fossa following the left glossopharyngeal nerve. The histopathological exam of the extra-axial lesion featured a nonencapsulated, moderately cellular, rather loose, proliferation of cuboidal to columnar epithelium breaching through chunks of an otherwise normal appearing dura mater and invading some cranial nerves. Sections of the cerebellum and brainstem revealed moderate, focal, impingement of the parenchyma with a very mild extension of the proliferating cells into the ventral left side of the medulla oblongata.

At 11 weeks postoperatively, the tibiotarsal joint showed good valgus stability and the dog's gait was subnormal. At 12 and 16 months postoperatively, the dog regained full function of the operated limb although no weight loss was initiated as recommended.</Abstract><Abstract>The use of a UHMWPE implant fixed with interference screws to reconstruct the MCTL allowed a return to full function of the tibiotarsal joint, without complications despite an early return to weight-bearing without external restraint. The success of this isolated surgical technique could lead to improvements in the surgical management of MCTL rupture if these initial results are confirmed by a prospective study with a larger number of patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligaments</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Currently, surgical management of CCLr is mostly performed using tibial osteotomy techniques to modify the biomechanical conformation of the affected stifle. These surgical techniques have a significant complication rate, associated with persistent instability of the stifle which may lead to chronic postoperative pain. Over the last decade, studies have been published on various techniques of anatomical caudal cruciate ligament reconstruction in veterinary practice, using physiological autografts or woven synthetic implants.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this ex vivo biomechanical study is to investigate the ex vivo dynamic biomechanical behavior of a synthetic implant [ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) implant] fixed with interference screws for the treatment of CCLr in dogs, according to a fatigue protocol (48 hours per test).</Abstract><Abstract>Seven stifles from four skeletally mature canine cadavers were implanted with the synthetic implant. It was fixed with four interference screws inserted in transversal and oblique tunnels in both the distal femur and the proximal tibia. For each case, 100,000 cycles were performed at 0.58 Hz, with traction loads ranging from 100 to 210 N.</Abstract><Abstract>Neither screw-bone assembly rupture nor a pull-out issue was observed during the dynamic tests. Linear stiffness of the implants associated with a fixation system with four interference screws increased over time. The final displacement did not exceed 3 mm for five of the seven specimens. Five of the seven synthetic implants yielded to a lengthening in functional range (0-3 mm). Linear stiffness was homogeneous among samples, showing a strong dynamic strength of the interference screw-based fixations of the UHMWPE implant in the femoral and tibial bones.</Abstract><Abstract>This study completes the existing literature on the biomechanical evaluation of passive stifle stabilization techniques with a testing protocol focused on cyclic loading at a given force level instead of driven by displacement. These biomechanical results should revive interest in intra-articular reconstruction after rupture of the CCLr in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Screws</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Much emphasis is placed on diagnosis and treatment, but little focus is given to the spine's mechanical properties. Degenerative spine diseases are a major problem throughout the world. According to the World Health Organization, osteoporosis is a world-class public problem that reduces bone mass, resulting in bone fracturing and increased risk of bone fracturing. Therefore, the mechanical investigation of vertebrae can provide more information about the development of osteoporosis.s.</Abstract><Abstract>For our case report, we used spayed mongrel lumbar vertebrae samples obtained from a canine which was about 8 years old and weighed 28 kg. The dog was diagnosed with a mammary tumor, and its owners decided to euthanize the dog. All consent forms were filled.</Abstract><Abstract>Mechanical tests were performed on three vertebrae, and a notable difference was observed in the first cycle of the first vertebra (L1). Second-order polynomials for displacement and seventh-order polynomials for pressure were proposed for describing the stress-strain relationship of the vertebrae under the cyclical loads. Our research protocol has been broken down into several parts. After measuring the area of the loaded surface, the largest area was in the L2 vertebra (176 &#177; 16 mm; 177 &#177; 3 mm) and the smallest was in the L7 vertebra (156 &#177; 4 mm; 151 &#177; 33 mm). The smallest distance was recorded between the first (L1) and seventh (L7) lumbar vertebrae (L1) (15.17 &#177; 0.93 mm), and the largest distance was recorded between the L3 and L4 vertebrae of the lumbar (19.8 &#177; 3.7 mm).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Density</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbosacral Region</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoporosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The therapeutic strategy, in these cases, is based on the heart rate control and digoxin is one of the most used drugs.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this work was to study the serum digoxin concentration changes in dogs with AF under long-term treatment with digoxin. Furthermore, the remission of clinical signs and the correlation between digoxinemia and other clinical and laboratory variables were retrospectively evaluated.</Abstract><Abstract>The prospective study was conducted on seven large breed dogs from the time of reaching the definitive digoxin dosage. Digoxinemia was determined at month: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, then twice a year. A post hoc statistical analysis investigated the influence of selected clinical and laboratory variables on the risk to develop spikes in digoxinemia. Clinical data, heart rate, digoxin dosage (mg/m[2]), and digoxinemia (ng/ml) at all available follow-ups were retrospectively evaluated from the medical records of 17 further dogs and a linear regression analysis was performed on the whole data set. The relation between the time of remission of AF clinical signs and variables was also investigated.</Abstract><Abstract>An unexpected increase in digoxin serum concentration was recorded in three dogs after one year monitoring, in absence of digoxin dosage changes. No statistical significance of all the studied variables on the risk to develop spikes of digoxinemia was registered. Two dogs, reaching digoxinemia 4.46 and 5.24 ng/ml, showed symptoms that reversed after digoxin withdrawal. From retrospective data, 88% of dogs reached complete reverse of AF clinical signs in 2.1 months from digoxin treatment starting, regardless of digoxin initial dosage, digoxinemia, and heart rate.</Abstract><Abstract>Digoxin in monotherapy remain a good option to treat AF in dogs, anyway digoxin toxicity could emerge during long-term therapy, similarly to what happen in human medicine. Life-threatening spikes of digoxinemia could occur, especially after 1-year treatment with digoxin.

The core aspects of therapy-diet control, exercise when possible, and adequate treatment of PPID-must also be maintained if using canagliflozin. Canagliflozin should be reserved for refractory cases. Further controlled trials to investigate canagliflozin pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Canagliflozin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperglycemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperinsulinism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Metformin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Monosaccharides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pergolide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pituitary Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sodium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Starch</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroxine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In addition, dogs with azotemia and lower urinary tract diseases were excluded. Information on canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) score, muscular condition score (MCS), presence of glycosuria, proteinuria [urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt; 0.5], and/or cylindruria (&gt;1-2 casts/hpf) at diagnosis were gleaned from the medical records. Dogs were retrospectively classified as food-responsive enteropathy, immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy, or nonresponsive enteropathy based on the presence of gastrointestinal histological inflammation and the treatment response. In addition, based on the serum albumin concentration (ALB), dogs were classified as having protein-losing enteropathy (PLE).</Abstract><Abstract>Ninety CE dogs were included. Fifty-two dogs had mild-to-severely decreased MCS and 38 dogs showed altered urinary parameters. No significant associations were found between CCECAI and altered urinary parameters.

CE is a debilitating and economically important disease primarily affecting sheep and goats caused by the Orf virus (ORFV). Despite field reports of CE in the country, there is no concise country-wide epidemiological data on the disease and limited genetic data of circulating Nigerian ORFV are available in the public domain.</Abstract><Abstract>An epidemiological survey of CE and molecular characterization of ORFV circulating in Nigeria from 2014 to 2016.</Abstract><Abstract>Data were collected using designed questionnaires, administered to veterinarians and farmers in selected States of Nigeria. Samples were collected during passive surveillance for CE from 2014 to 2016 which were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The A32L and B2L genes of circulating ORFV were also characterized.</Abstract><Abstract>Analysis of the questionnaire showed that 69.54% (n = 82/118) of the farmers claimed to have experienced CE in their flocks with average morbidity and mortality rates of 25% and 15%, respectively. A total of 113 veterinarians participated in the study, with 69.9% (n = 79) familiar with CE and claimed CE causes morbidity rates of 25%-37% and mortality rates of 10%-15% in sheep and goats. Laboratory results revealed that ORFV was detected in 72% (18/25) of outbreak samples analyzed by real-time PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of A32L and B2L genes revealed that Nigerian ORFV sequences belong to clusters I and II and are similar to viruses from India, Ethiopia, and China.</Abstract><Abstract>This study is the first nationwide epidemiological data on the status of CE in sheep and goats in Nigeria. It is also the first report of molecular characterization of two genes of ORFV circulating and causing outbreaks in small ruminants in the country.

Here, we describe the successful clinical management of two pet rabbits with fipronil toxicosis.</Abstract><Abstract>The first case was a 5-month-old, intact female, rabbit that presented with the acute onset of seizures, obtunded mentation, and in lateral recumbency, while the second rabbit was a 1-year-old, intact male, rabbit that presented with anorexia and lethargy. In both cases, the owners reported to have administered a 0.5 ml fipronil vial topically on the skin as an antiparasitic drug between 4 and 6 hours prior to presentation. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry were unremarkable and both rabbits tested negative on Encephalitozoon cuniculi serology. Both animals were decontaminated by bathing with tepid water and dishwashing soap. The rabbit with seizures received on admission intravenous midazolam. In both cases, overnight hospitalization, intravenous isotonic crystalloid fluids, and assisted-feeding by oral syringe were provided until voluntary feeding was resumed. Both rabbits rapidly improved approximately 12 hours of initiating supportive care. Complete resolution of clinical signs and return of normal appetite and defecation occurred within 24 hours of hospitalization in both animals. No recurrence of neurological signs was reported in the rabbit presenting with seizures on a follow-up period of 1 month.</Abstract><Abstract>The outcome of these cases suggests that supportive treatment of fipronil toxicity in pet rabbits can be successful if administered promptly.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antiparasitic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Crystalloid Solutions</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Midazolam</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyrazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seizures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soaps</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The bitch had a history of claudication and a mass in the left humeral scapular region, which revealed osteolysis of the proximal humerus on radiography. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed numerous neoplastic cells arranged mostly in cohesive groups but sometimes isolated, that contained cytoplasmic vacuoles and had a moderate-to-high nucleus: cytoplasm ratio with frequent karyomegaly and evident nucleoli. Histologically, the neoplasm was organized in solid, tubular structures with luminal spaces filled with eosinophilic secretions and was composed of cells with clear cytoplasm and prominent vacuoles that pushed the nuclei to the periphery, resembling signet ring cells. The extracellular and intracytoplasmic material of the epithelial cells was positive for periodic acid-Schiff staining and immunoreactive for alpha-lactalbumin. Two chemotherapy sessions were performed, but 1 month after surgery, the clinical condition worsened, and euthanasia was elected, accounting for 133 days of survival after surgical removal of the tumor.</Abstract><Abstract>The bitch presented with secretory mammary carcinoma with nodal and bone metastases, and histological and immunohistochemical characteristics were important for diagnosis.

A P-Holter can also take continuous measurements for up to 14 days without replacing the battery or SD card.</Abstract><Abstract>To compare the performance of the P-Holter and the C-Holter in healthy cats. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether multiday recordings with the P-Holter decrease sympathetic nerve activity or improve the accuracy of arrhythmia detection.</Abstract><Abstract>Five healthy domestic short-haired cats were used for this study. Both a P-Holter and C-Holter were used on the first day, but only the P-Holter was used on days 2-6. The evaluated variables were the analyzable time of both Holter types, heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and the number of arrhythmia occurrences.</Abstract><Abstract>For two out of the five cats, measurement of P-Holter was interrupted. Eventually, continuous recordings using the P-Holters were able to be collected from all individuals for 6 days. The 24 hours analyzable time from the P-Holter and C-Holter was almost identical (p = 0.94). The 24 hours mean HR did not differ across Holter types (p = 0.67). In addition, the timing of the occurrences of arrhythmias was almost identical to the P-Holter and C-Holter. Results of HRV suggested that sympathetic nerve activity was likely to decrease and vagal nerve activity was likely to increase after 4-5 days of measurement, compared to the second day of measurement (p &lt; 0.05). When only the P-Holter was installed, the number of arrhythmia occurrences was similar on days 2-6.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, the P-Holter may be as useful as the C-Holter in cats with suspected intermittent arrhythmias, although the P-Holters were placed on cats without a clinical indication. However, cats may have individual differences in their adaptation to the device. P-Holter recordings taken for more than 4-5 days may allow the cat to acclimate to the device and reduce sympathetic nerve activity. The accuracy of arrhythmia detection across multiday P-Holter recordings requires further investigation using clinical cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Animals in the study were diagnosed with the primary disease by standard echocardiographic methods and algorithms. Blood samples were collected at the moment of presentation and frozen in a -80&#176;C fridge. For biochemistry analysis, we used species-specific ELISA kits, provided by Cloud-Clone Corp. (USA). The tests were provided by the means of Almazov National Medical Research Center, IEM laboratory.</Abstract><Abstract>Dogs with EchoCG-proved PostPH had a higher concentration of VEGF-D in comparison to control and PrePH (&#1088; &lt;0.001, for both). There was no difference between the control and PrePH groups (&#1088; &gt;0.05). ET-1 was higher in PrePH in comparison to PostPH and control dogs (&#1088; &lt;0.001, for both). In addition, there was no difference between the control and PostPH groups (&#1088; &gt;0.05). Serotonin concertation did not have a difference between controls and PostPH. However, it was higher in PrePH than in control (&#1088; &lt;0.033) and PostPH group (&#1088; &lt;0.006). Receiver operating curve analysis showed that plasma concentrations of ET-1 (0.99) and VEGF-D (0.92) had high effectiveness in the differentiation of PostPH and PrePH.</Abstract><Abstract>This study showed a correlation between circulating biomarkers (serotonin, ET-1, and VEGF-D).

Economic losses, impacts on animal health and welfare, and public health concerns justify its herd-level control.</Abstract><Abstract>To systematically collect information to answer: What are the control and eradication strategies of PTB in dairy cattle worldwide?</Abstract><Abstract>The search procedure was carried out on October 2nd, 2019, and updated on August 3rd, 2021, using OVID[&#174;], SciELO, and Redalyc databases, and the registers from the International Colloquium on Paratuberculosis (1991-2018). The inclusion criteria considered articles published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and in peer-reviewed journals. The exclusion criteria included irrelevant topics, species other-than bovines, and not original articles. Definitive studies were obtained through the consensus of the authors on eligibility and quality. Data extraction was performed, considering bibliographic information, control and outcome strategies, follow-up time, and results.</Abstract><Abstract>Twenty-six relevant studies were found, reporting the use of three grouped control strategies: hygiene and management strategy (HMS), test-and-cull strategy (TCS), and vaccination strategy (VS). The HMS was the most common one (20/26), followed by TCS (17/26) and VS (7/26). Combined control strategies such as TCS-HMS (12/26), TCS-VS (1/26), and HMS-VS (1/26) were also described, and the consideration of the three control strategies (TCS-HMS-VS) was reported in two articles. The HMS included practices such as neonates/juvenile livestock hygiene, biosecurity, prevention of infection introduction into the herd, and environmental management. Within HMS, the most frequent practices were to remove calves from their dams as soon as possible after birth and to keep the minimal exposure of calves and heifers to adult cattle. As limitations, within the HMS, it is considered that some strategies cannot be included due to lack of compliance, or the application of the same strategy among one study and another may have a different degree of interpretation; publication bias was not controlled since the results of the control programs in endemic countries may be not available.</Abstract><Abstract>The main PTB control strategies in dairy cattle worldwide are HMS, TCS, and VS. The use of one or several combined strategies has been found to succeed in controlling the disease at the herd-level.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paratuberculosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Felbamate is an anti-seizure drug with established pharmacokinetic and safety data for dogs, but little published evidence of efficacy for managing generalized seizures in this species.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this retrospective case series was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral felbamate in six presumptive epileptic dogs experiencing generalized seizures.</Abstract><Abstract>Medical records from six dogs with presumptive idiopathic/genetic epilepsy manifesting as generalized seizure activity, for which oral felbamate was used as an add-on treatment, were reviewed. The number of seizures recorded for the 3-month period immediately before instituting felbamate was recorded for each dog. Short-term (3 months) and long-term (6 months or greater) seizure frequency post-felbamate therapy was recorded for each dog and compared with baseline.</Abstract><Abstract>Overall, dogs experienced a reduction (82%) in seizures after adding felbamate in the short term, with 5/6 dogs (83%) classified as responders (50% or greater reduction in seizures) and 3/6 dogs (50%) attaining seizure-free status. Mean and median long-term follow-up times were 13 and 11 months, respectively (range: 6 to 23 months). Four of the 6 dogs (67%) remained drug responders at final follow-up, with an average seizure reduction of 98%, 2 of which remained seizure-free at 8 and 21 months. Two dogs (33%) experienced increased seizure activity during long-term follow-up (12 and 23 months) and were considered non-responders. The non-responder dogs had an average long-term seizure reduction of 33%. No dog experienced any obvious adverse effects associated with felbamate administration. However, one dog not included in the analysis because of insufficient (&lt;3 month) post-felbamate follow-up, was weaned off felbamate because of suspected hepatotoxicity.</Abstract><Abstract>Our small case series suggests that oral felbamate might show promise as an add-on drug for epileptic dogs experiencing generalized seizures resistant to drug therapy.

The dogs had not previously been treated for CSK. Systemic and ophthalmologic examinations were performed to exclude other abnormalities. An administered amount of MSC (1 &#215; 10[6] cells each time) was injected via subconjunctival in the peri-limbal region at 0 and 30 days. The animals were followed for 110 days for clinical evaluation, and, at the same time, the images of the corneal abnormalities were obtained and analyzed in the ImageJ software.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the antiemetic effect of maropitant administered via the transdermal route in cats.</Abstract><Abstract>There were 8 cats enrolled in this study, weighing between 2 and 7 kg, more than 6 months old, and experiencing at least 2 episodes of vomiting in the last 72 hours. Compounded transdermal maropitant was prepared using finely ground Cerenia[&#174;] tablets, dissolved in propylene glycol and incorporated in the commercial liposomal base Pentravan[&#174;] (Fagron[&#174;], Thiais, France). The uniformity of content was determined using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The product was administered at a dosage of 4 mg/cat once a day (QD), applied on the inner pinna of the ear for five consecutive days. Monitoring and evaluation of vomiting frequency and nausea were performed. A significant decrease in vomiting frequency was observed in 6 of the 8 enrolled cats. A reduction in nausea, associated with an improvement of appetite, was observed in some cases.</Abstract><Abstract>Transdermal application of maropitant to cats experiencing vomiting seems to be efficient and a good alternative to existing oral medication, taking into account the difficulty of oral administration in these cases. This work provides preliminary clinical results of the efficacy of transdermal maropitant in cats. Further studies are necessary to determine dosing and pharmacokinetics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Administration, Cutaneous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vomiting</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antiemetics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nausea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Management of this subtype with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy has so far not been reported. This case report describes the treatment with surgical management followed by intracavitary carboplatin.</Abstract><Abstract>A 12-year-old male neutered domestic short hair cat was referred for lethargy, hyporexia, and weight loss, and was diagnosed with a cranial mediastinal mass radiographically. Initial cytology through fine needle aspirates was suggestive of carcinoma. Computed tomography was performed which did not show evidence of other primary tumor sources or metastases, and hence surgical resection was recommended. Intraoperative findings revealed local invasion of the surrounding tissues, including major vasculature and nerves, although histopathological assessment showed no local lymph node involvement. Intracavitary carboplatin chemotherapy was administered 2 weeks postsurgery. The patient was humanely euthanized 4 weeks postsurgery due to evidence of local recurrence causing significant respiratory compromise.</Abstract><Abstract>A combination of surgical excision as well as intracavitary carboplatin does not seem to be effective for the treatment of this thymic carcinoma subtype, with evidence of early recurrence and return of clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carboplatin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Maintaining the mice strain by natural mating systems is costly and seems impractical, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sperm-freezing is a cost-effective solution for &#946;-thal mouse colony management.</Abstract><Abstract>To determine appropriate cryopreservation media for &#946;-thal mouse spermatozoa to establish a &#946;-thal mouse sperm bank.</Abstract><Abstract>The epididymal spermatozoa of C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and &#946;-globin gene knockout thalassemia (BKO) mice were frozen in four freezing media: I) raffinose-skim milk-monothioglycerol (MTG), II) raffinose-skim milk-glutamine, III) raffinose-egg yolk-glycerol, and IV) egg yolk-TES-Tris. The sperm quality was assessed prior to and following freeze-thawing.</Abstract><Abstract>Compared with WT counterparts, the viable spermatozoa before freezing exhibiting elevated levels of oxidative stress were significantly greater in BKO (p = 0.01). After thawing, the membrane integrity of BKO spermatozoa preserved in I was significantly lower (p = 0.001). The sperm viability and membrane integrity of BKO males were also inferior when media III and IV were used (p = 0.008-0.027). The amount of oxidative stress in the spermatozoon of BKO mice was significantly greater when preserved in I, III, and IV (p = 0.002-0.044). Comparing freezing media, the motility and acrosome integrity of WT and BKO spermatozoa preserved in IV were significantly higher than those in other media (p &lt; 0.001 to p = 0.01). Spermatozoa with the highest mitochondrial membrane potential were observed in I in both genotypes (p = 0.012 to p &gt; 0.05). The viability, membrane integrity, and oxidative stress of post-thaw BKO spermatozoa did not significantly differ among freezing solutions.</Abstract><Abstract>Irrespective of freezing media, spermatozoa of BKO males are rather more sensitive to cryopreservation than those of WT. Raffinose-skim milk-MTG/glutamine, raffinose-egg yolk-glycerol, and egg yolk-TES-Tris can all be used to preserve BKO mouse spermatozoa. However, with slightly better sperm characteristics, egg yolk-TES-Tris may be a diluent of choice for BKO mouse sperm cryopreservation. The addition of a reducing agent to thawing media is also strongly recommended to efficiently prevent oxidative stress and therefore improve frozen-thawed sperm survival.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycerol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Thalassemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glutamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pandemics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Raffinose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryoprotective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sperm Motility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred C57BL</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryopreservation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The serological examination was carried out by using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit in serum (ID.Vet Innovative Diagnostics Louis Pasteur. Grabeis, France). The results were analyzed statistically using the chi-square test to assess the association between seroprevalence and different parameters (age, sex, season, housing, and health status).</Abstract><Abstract>Thirteen cattle were seropositive for B. besnoiti by ELISA and showed symptoms of besnoitiosis. Acute symptoms included fever, tachycardia, edematous swellings of intermandibular space and limbs with polyarthritis, diarrhea, ruminal atony, and enlarged lymph nodes. The chronic symptoms included cough, mastitis, exophthalmia, cysts on the sclera and conjunctiva, nodules in the skin, and alopecia associated with tick infestation. The overall seroprevalence of B. besnoiti was 22.1%. Regarding sex, the seroprevalence was higher for females 34.6% than for males 6.97%. While, according to age susceptibility, the seroprevalence was highest (50.9%) with age &#8805;5 years, followed by age &gt;1 to &lt;5 years (14.6%), and only one animal of age &#8804;1 year was recorded at 2.2%.

The ecology and epidemiology of IAV are very complex and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens is one of the greatest challenges in the healthcare. IAV are characterized by genetic and antigenic variability resulting from a combination of high mutation rates and a segmented genome that provides the ability to rapidly change and adapt to new hosts. In this context, available scientific evidence is of great importance for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of influenza viruses. The present review summarizes original research papers and IAV infections reported in dogs all over the world. Reports of interspecies transmission of equine influenza viruses H3N2 from birds to dogs, as well as double and triple reassortant strains resulting from reassortment of avian, human, and canine strains have amplified the genetic variety of canine influenza viruses. A total of 146 articles were deemed acceptable by PubMed and the Google Scholar database and were therefore included in this review. The largest number of research articles (n = 68) were published in Asia, followed by the Americas (n = 44), Europe (n = 31), Africa (n = 2), and Australia (n = 1). Publications are conventionally divided into three categories. The first category (largest group) included modern articles published from 2011 to the present (n = 93). The second group consisted of publications from 2000 to 2010 (n = 46). Single papers of 1919, 1931, 1963, 1972, 1975, and 1992 were also used, which was necessary to emphasize the history of the study of the ecology and evolution of the IAV circulating among various mammalian species. The largest number of publications occurred in 2010 (n = 18) and 2015 (n = 11), which is associated with IAV outbreaks observed at that time in the dog population in America, Europe, and Asia. In general, these findings raise concerns that dogs may mediate the adaptation of IAVs to zoonotic transmission and therefore serve as alternative hosts for genetic reassortment of these viruses. The global concern and significant threat to public health from the present coronavirus diseases 2019 pandemic confirms the necessity for active surveillance of zoonotic viral diseases with pandemic potential.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza A virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza, Human</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, no quantitative comparison of osteotomy level has been performed for canine THRs to date.</Abstract><Abstract>To develop and validate a method for quantifying the level of the osteotomy at its most distomedial aspect in conjunction with canine THR and to compare osteotomy level between multiple different THRs.</Abstract><Abstract>Immediate post-operative cranial-caudal or caudal-cranial radiographs of 33 dogs treated with 17 Helica and 17 BFX THR were assessed and osteotomy level was quantified using a novel radiographic assessment by 3 independent observers. Correlation among observers was quantified using a Spearman rank order correlation. Osteotomy location was subsequently quantified for an additional 10 Zurich THRs. The osteotomy level for each THR was subsequently compared between Helica, BFX, and Zurich THRs using one-way non-parametric Mann-Whitney rank sum tests and significance set at p &lt; 0.05.</Abstract><Abstract>R-values assessing correlation between observers were 0.87, 0.72, and 0.60.

Sixty-six eyes (from 65 dogs) diagnosed with non-infectious deep ulcerative keratitis from the medical treatment group (n = 34) and the combined treatment group (n = 32) were included. The combined treatment group was prescribed the same conservative medical administrations plus a surgical nictitating membrane flap for 14 days.</Abstract><Abstract>Healing time was defined as the duration of time from the day that the dog had been diagnosed with deep ulcerative keratitis by a fluorescein staining test to the day that the corneal fluorescein stain was negative. Overall, the mean age of dogs with deep ulcerative keratitis was 10.49 &#177; 4.7 years. The disease was commonly evident in females more than males. Shih Tzu was the most prevalent dog breed. The corneal healing time between dogs receiving medical therapy alone and those receiving combined treatment was not statistically significant (p = 0.386). Healing times were not significantly different between sex and breed (p = 0.41). The median corneal healing time for dogs older than 10 years in the combined treatments group (29.5 days; ranging from 20 to 46 days) was longer than for those receiving medical therapy alone (21 days; ranging from 9.5 to 30.5 days).</Abstract><Abstract>Supportive therapy including a nictitating membrane flap is suggested in dogs prone to deep corneal ulcers not involving infection.

It is characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic lymphocytes in the bone marrow, which are morphologically normal (mature), but non-functional. CLL in canines commonly originates in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TCD8[+]), and although there is controversy regarding the prognostic value of the immunophenotype, this cell lineage may be associated with a good prognosis.</Abstract><Abstract>A 10-year-old, entire female, mixed-breed dog was brought to the University Hospital of the Veterinary Faculty (UdelaR) for consultation because a routine pre-surgical check-up revealed lymphocytic leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, and hyperglobulinemia due to an oligoclonal gammopathy. The ultrasound revealed splenomegaly. PCR performed on blood was negative for Ehrlichia canis. Blood and bone marrow flow cytometry was performed to complement the diagnosis and carry out the immunophenotype, which showed CLL of CD8[+] T-cell lineage. The clinical suspicion of CLL was confirmed by a myelogram. Chemotherapy treatment based on alkylating agents and glucocorticoids was established.

It is difficult to control all potential sources of microbial contamination due to the complexity of the habitats present during the pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest stages of the food supply chain. This is due to the fact that contamination can occur at any stage. As a consequence of this, the food industry is perpetually at risk of being tainted by microorganisms, notwithstanding the progress that has been made in contemporary technology. Antibiotic usage has exacerbated the problem, leading to the emergence of infections transmitted by antibiotic-resistant foods. It's critical to work on novel ways to reduce microbial contamination in meat and in the meat processing environment. Therefore, to assure the wholesomeness of the finished product, several control procedures must be adopted throughout the food manufacturing and processing chain. Because of this, bacteriophages and the derivatives of these viruses have arisen as an innovative, significant, and risk-free option for the prevention, treatment, and/or elimination of such pollutants in a variety of foodstuff handling environments. So, the focus of this review was on the future potential of integrated phage, modified phage, and their derivatives as antimicrobials in the traditional farm-to-table setting, which encompasses areas like primary production, post-harvest processing, bio-sanitation, and bio-detection. In addition to presenting certain safety concerns. Also, this paper discusses how to assure the safe and successful use of bacteriophages in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteriophages</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Microbiology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Underlying causes for spontaneous pneumothorax vary with ruptured bullae being one of the main causes. Treatment after initial stabilization often requires partial or complete surgical resection of affected lung lobes. Partial lung lobectomy can be performed with stapling devices or sealing devices for example, by different surgical approaches including video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. However, inter-thoracic surgery in small-sized dogs using either of the techniques is challenging.</Abstract><Abstract>A 12-year-old Shih Tzu was presented with spontaneous pneumothorax. Further diagnostics with computed tomography and intercostal thoracoscopy revealed a bulla in the right middle lung lobe. Partial lung lobectomy (2.5 &#215; 2.5 &#215; 2 cm) of the respective lung lobe was performed by an intercostal approach using the Caiman[&#174;] 5 Seal &amp; Cut sealing device. The Caiman[&#174;] 5 Seal &amp; Cut device allowed quick and safe partial lung lobectomy in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax without intra- or post-operative complications. The dog was discharged 2 days after surgery in good clinical condition.

To date, commercial vaccines and drugs for the prevention of ASF are lacking in the market and the survival of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in various environmental, farm, and or feed matrices has allowed the virus to remain, causing new outbreaks in the pig population. Besides biosecurity and animal husbandry management practices, the improvement of the host immune responses is critical to control, managing, and preventing ASF.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, we investigated the protective role of &#946;-glucan against ASFV infection using a porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) model.</Abstract><Abstract>The effects of &#946;-glucan on cell proliferation were evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The potential effects of &#946;-glucan against a field ASFV strain isolated in Vietnam were further examined by real-time PCR and hemadsorption assays. The interferon (IFN)-&#945; and interleukin (IL)-6 protein production induced by &#946;-glucan was determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results demonstrated that the &#946;-glucan additive possessed an immune stimulus factor against ASFV. Specifically, protection of PAMs against ASFV infection in vitro was observed at 12 hours (p &lt; 0.05) at the tested doses (30 and 50 &#181;g/ml) as induced by incubation with &#946;-glucan for 2 hours. These effects remained until 24 hours after post-infection. Additionally, at a high dose (50 &#181;g/ml), pre-treatment with the &#946;-glucan statistically increased the expression levels of IFN&#945; and IL-6 when compared to untreated groups or only ASFV infection.</Abstract><Abstract>Together, these findings indicated that the &#946;-glucan may protect the host against ASFV infection via the multiple cellular immune mechanisms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Glucans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Mycoplasma bovis is often isolated from the deep pharynges of healthy cattle and is generally considered not to cause clinical symptoms while in the upper respiratory tract. In mycoplasma infections, adhesion to the host cells is a crucial step. In recent years, five new adhesins, NOX, &#945;-enolase, TrmFO, P27, and VpmaX, have been reported in M. bovis strains from pneumonia cases. However, the presence of these adhesins in wild isolates has not been established.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aimed to investigate the presence of these adhesin genes in wild isolates isolated from cattle nasal cavities and lesion sites (pneumonia, otitis media, arthritis, and mastitis) in various regions in Japan and clarify the relationship between adhesion and the symptoms caused by M. bovis infection.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 141 M. bovis wild isolates isolated from nasal cavities (healthy or sick cattle), lungs with pneumonia, ears with otitis media, joint fluids of arthritic animals, and milk of mastitic animals. Mycoplasma bovis type strain PG45 was also used. Specific polymerase chain reaction reactions were performed to detect nox, &#945;-enolase, trmFO, P27, and vpmaX, which are adhesins of M. bovis.</Abstract><Abstract>This study reports 139 M. bovis wild isolates were positive for nox, &#945;-enolase, trmFO, P27, and vpmaX, while two isolates each lacked &#945;-enolase or P27 genes. Mycoplasma bovis PG45 also had all five adherens genes.</Abstract><Abstract>Almost all M. bovis wild isolates possessed all nox, &#945;-enolase, trmFO, P27, and vpmaX genes regardless of the lesion site or region of origin. This means no relationship was found between the presence of the five adhesins and lesion sites in M. bovis and M. bovis isolated from the nasal cavities of asymptomatic cattle have the same numbers and types of adhesins as isolates from symptomatic lesion sites (pneumonia, otitis media, arthritis, and mastitis). This suggests that not only M. bovis isolates from pulmonary lesions, but also M. bovis existing in the nasal cavity has the potential to causes symptoms in the host.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoplasma bovis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumonia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphopyruvate Hydratase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Group C received no treatment, while groups T1, T2, and T3 received graded doses of oral vitamin D, sequentially 8, 16, and 24 IU, for 3 weeks. IL-17 expression and the extent of endometriotic peritoneal lesions were then measured and analyzed. Statistical tests were performed to see the difference in the mean area of endometriosis lesions and IL-17 expression between the control and treatment groups, as well as the correlation between the extent of endometriosis lesions and IL-17.</Abstract><Abstract>Endometriosis lesions decreased after 16 and 24 IU of vitamin D administration (p 0.023 and 0.009). Endometriosis lesion also tends to be smaller after 8 IU of vitamin D supplementation, although insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). IL-17 expression was significantly lower after 24 IU vitamin D administration compared to the untreated group (p = 0.004). Lower IL-17 expressions were also observed after 8 and 16 IU vitamin D administration, although insignificant (p = 0.452 and p = 0.645). IL-17 expression was moderately and positively correlated with the extent of endometriosis lesions (p = 0.012, rho = 0.505).</Abstract><Abstract>By modulating the expression of IL-17 in endometriotic lesions, vitamin D inhibited the development of endometriotic lesions in the endometriosis mice model.

Several novel murine paramyxoviruses have been discovered in the last several decades. Although these viruses are unclassified, they are recognized as Beilong virus, Mojiang virus (MojV), and Tailam virus in rats, Jeilongvirus, Nariva, Paju Apodemus paramyxovirus-1 and -2 in mice, and Pentlands paramyxovirus-1, -2, and -3 in squirrels. These paramyxoviruses were reported mainly in China and a few other countries like Australia, the Republic of Korea, Trinidad, and France. In June 2012, it becomes a great concern in China whereby, three miners were reported dead potentially caused by a novel zoonotic MojV, a henipa-like virus isolated from tissue samples of rats from the same cave. Rats are considered to be natural hosts for the MojV from the literature research. The classified paramyxovirus, Sendai virus in rodents is also reviewed. Paramyxoviruses infection in rodents leads to respiratory distress such as necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchiolitis, and interstitial pneumonia. Infections caused by paramyxoviruses often spread between species, manifesting disease in spillover hosts, including humans.

Efforts to improve preparedness for ASF outbreak management are proceeding in earnest and mathematical modeling is an integral part of these efforts.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aimed to assess the impact on within-herd transmission dynamics of ASF when the models used to simulate transmission assume there is homogeneous mixing of animals within a barn.</Abstract><Abstract>Barn-level heterogeneity was explicitly captured using a stochastic, individual pig-based, heterogeneous transmission model that considers three types of infection transmission, (1) within-pen via nose-to-nose contact; (2) between-pen via nose-to-nose contact with pigs in adjacent pens; and (3) both between- and within-pen via distance-independent mechanisms (e.g., via fomites). Predictions were compared between the heterogeneous and the homogeneous Gillespie models.</Abstract><Abstract>Results showed that the predicted mean number of infectious pigs at specific time points differed greatly between the homogeneous and heterogeneous models for scenarios with low levels of between-pen contacts via distance-independent pathways and the differences between the two model predictions were more pronounced for the slow contact rate scenario. The heterogeneous transmission model results also showed that it may take significantly longer to detect ASF, particularly in large barns when transmission predominantly occurs via nose-to-nose contact between pigs in adjacent pens.</Abstract><Abstract>The findings emphasize the need for completing preliminary explorations when working with homogeneous mixing models to ascertain their suitability to predict disease outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, in dogs with FS, the damage in the proximal tubules that is responsible for the clinical symptoms has not been evaluated. Among FS cases, tubular damage in acquired FS is reversible following the elimination of a causative factor. Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a biomarker of tubular damage in various animals including dogs. Urinary L-FABP measurement may be useful for the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation in canine FS.</Abstract><Abstract>At the first visit, two Toy Poodles that had no remarkable findings on physical examination presented with glycosuria without hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, increased levels of plasma alkaline phosphatase, and metabolic acidosis. Considering all the factors involved, the dogs were clinically diagnosed with acquired FS. The owner reported that they routinely fed the dog with chicken jerky, a recently considered cause of acquired FS. Following the withdrawal of the jerky, abnormalities including glycosuria improved in both dogs. Moreover, urinary L-FABP levels, which were high at diagnosis, presented a decreasing trend during the follow-up. However, in one dog, the elevated urinary L-FABP level did not return to normal.</Abstract><Abstract>Although the clinical symptoms of acquired FS in dogs could be improved by the elimination of a causative factor, the severity of tubular damage described by urinary L-FABP may not be necessarily linked to the degree of functional deterioration. Therefore, the evaluation of proximal tubular damage by L-FABP may be of clinical value during the follow-up of acquired FS in canines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fanconi Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycosuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

EED refers to the fetal mortality which varies in mare and camelids but most probably not later than 50 days of gestation. This duration may be divided into very early mortality, early mortality and late embryonic mortality. This also varies in mare and camelids. There are different embryonic, maternal, environmental/external, and infectious and noninfectious factors which lead to early embryonic loss. Diagnosis is very difficult as in most of the cases resorption of fetus occurs but it is done by the use of ultrasound. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to avoid early embryonic mortality. However, new reproductive technologies have increased the service rate in a herd, and efforts are still being made to determine the rate and frequency of camel embryonic loss.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Abortion, Veterinary</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Further, an association between BPA and circulating vitamin D (VitD) levels were documented.</Abstract><Abstract>The role of VitD in BPA-induced liver pathological changes was explored in this study.</Abstract><Abstract>Healthy 4.5-week-old male (n = 35) and female (n = 35) Swiss albino mice were used in this study. The animals were randomly divided into control and treated groups. The control groups were further divided into sham (no treatment) and vehicle (corn oil), whereas the treated groups were also divided into VitD (2195 U/kg), BPA (50 &#956;g/kg), and BPA + VitD (50 &#956;g/kg + 2195 U/kg) groups. For 6 weeks (twice a week), the animals were dosed intraperitoneally. One week later (at 10.5-weeks-old), the animals were sacrificed for biochemical and histological analyses.</Abstract><Abstract>BPA produced a considerable rise in the body and liver weights in both genders of mice when compared to control mice. BPA also caused significant increases in the liver damage markers alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). It also induced liver histopathological changes, including higher apoptotic indices in both genders. On the other hand, treatment with VitD considerably reduced liver damage and slightly decreased the apoptotic index rate. The ALP, ALT, and GGT levels were also markedly reduced. VitD has been proven to have a protective effect on both genders.</Abstract><Abstract>According to our findings, VitD protects mice from BPA-induced liver damage, possibly via suppressing liver damage markers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Benzhydryl Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endocrine Disruptors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin D</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in blood plasma can be an indicator of oxidative stress. Then, macrophages can secrete proinflammatory cytokines that will stimulate immune cells and vascular endothelial cells to release inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrotic factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;). Curcuma longa works by scavenging the active free radicals involved in the peroxidation process.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to prove that the administration of C. longa can reduce MDA, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 levels in Rattus norvegicus exposed to soot particulates.</Abstract><Abstract>The subjects of this study were 30 male rats which were divided into 5 treatment groups with the following: (C0): negative control; (C+): positive control; (T1): Treatment group 2, rats exposed to particulate soot at a concentration of 1,064 mg/m[3] for 8 hours and given C. longa at a dose of 1 mg/kg bw; (T2): Treatment group 3 was rats exposed to soot particulates at a concentration of 1,064 mg/m[3] for 8 hours and given C. longa at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw; (T3): Treatment group 4 was rats exposed to soot particulates at a concentration of 1,064 mg/m[3] for 8 hours and given C. longa at a dose of 3 mg/kg bw.Giving the C. longa extract orally with a probe every day for 30 days after treatment of exposure to soot.

The data on the clinical characteristics of animals, hematology, serology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were retrieved and tabulated. The data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using a simple descriptive method and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26, respectively.</Abstract><Abstract>Fourteen cases of sRCC in animals have been identified in this study. It was found in rodents, dogs, and cats. sRCC predominantly occurred in rodents (57.14%) without specific clinical signs. The common histopathological findings of sRCC were epithelial renal cells transition into elongated atypical spindle cells. In addition, other histopathological patterns of a renal epithelial cell such as clear cell, tubule-cystic, and papillary also have been found. IHC by using antibodies demonstrates that PAX8 is expressed on sRCC tissue samples 92.85% (13/14 samples). Hence, PAX8 could be used as a supporting method for establishing the diagnosis of sRCC in animals. Hematology and serological tests did not correlate to the type of sRCC either pure sRCC or dedifferentiated sRCC. sRCC results in hypercreatinemia in rodents and dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>This study shows that the incidence of sRCC in animals is rare. Animals with sRCC did not show any specific clinical signs. The histopathological finding is quite difficult to be differentiated from the other RCC.

This needs to concentrate the efforts to minimize and control these organisms. Efflux pumps are considered one of the important strategies used by bacteria to exclude harmful materials from the cell. Inhibition of these pumps can be an active strategy against multidrug resistance pathogens. There are two sources of efflux pump inhibitors that can be used, chemical and natural inhibitors. The chemical origin efflux pump inhibitors have many toxic side effects while the natural origin is characterized by a wide margin of safety for the host cell.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, the ability of some plant extracts like (propolis show rosemary, clove, capsaicin, and cumin) to potentiate the inhibitory activity of some antibiotics such as (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, and ampicillin) against Staphylococcus aureus pathogen were tested.</Abstract><Abstract>Efflux pump inhibitory activity of the selected plant extracts was tested using an ethidium bromide (EtBr) accumulation assay.</Abstract><Abstract>The results have shown that Propolis has a significant synergistic effect in combination with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and gentamycin.

With this research, we hope to draw the attention of researchers to the fact that the examination of animals for this disease is just as important as the examination of humans; human osteoporosis research receives a great deal of attention, while animals and their health are neglected.</Abstract><Abstract>We aimed to analyze the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and thickness of first (L1) and second (L2) lumbar vertebrae samples from five cadavers using histomorphometric analysis. In addition, we aimed to investigate one cadaver using microcomputed tomography (&#956;CT) imaging.</Abstract><Abstract>The L1 and L2 vertebrae from five dog carcasses were used to evaluate the BV/TV and the trabecular thicknesses. We used precise sampling criteria, and also developed a methodological approach to the study of the vertebrae. Using semi-automated methods, we performed histomorphometric analysis and &#956;CT data analysis.</Abstract><Abstract>We used five dog cadavers in this research. During the histomorphometry study, we observed that the lowest L1 BV/TV ratio was 7.88% and the highest was 23.08%. The L2 vertebrae BV/TV ranged from 11.58% to 23.7%. The L1 and L2 lumbar trabeculae thicknesses were also measured. L1's smallest trabecula was 17.34 microns and its largest was 31.88. The L2 vertebrae trabecula thickness was 18.76-30.75 microns. BV/TV and trabecular thickness were positively correlated (and vice versa). The two-tailed p value was less than 0.00001. This difference is statistically significant. After &#956;CT analysis, we discovered regions in the vertebral body with low porosity; these cavities are usually filled with connective tissue. The bone tissue in these areas is more vulnerable, meaning fracture risk has increased.</Abstract><Abstract>Animals should not just be considered as models for osteoporosis in humans, but also as potential patients. A single test, such as histomorphometry, may not be sufficient; more advanced technology, such as &#956;CT, is required, since it reveals the pores that make the vertebral column more brittle and susceptible to fracture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>X-Ray Microtomography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoporosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone and Bones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The therapy disrupts the virulence structure of the bacteria, resulting in bacterial death. Currently, chemical drugs have resulted in many resistant bacteria, so it is necessary to find alternative natural materials that are not toxic and do not quickly induce resistance.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aimed to analyze the potential of methanol extract from Black soldier fly (BSF) prepupae as an antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas through in silico and in vitro tests.</Abstract><Abstract>The BSF prepupae methanol extract was analyzed for protein and fatty acid contents. Disc diffusion method, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration test were used for in vitro tests against Staphylococcis and Aeromonas. Molecular docking of the active ingredients (defensin, chitin, and chitosan as well as fatty acids) in BSF was downloaded from the NCBI database and docked by the Hex Cuda version 8.0 program with Correlation type parameters Shape + Electro and Grid Dimension version 0.6. Docking results were analyzed using the Discovery Studio program version 21.1.1.</Abstract><Abstract>The highest fatty acid contents in the extract were palmitic acid and myristic acid. Methanol extract from BSF prepupae acted as a bactericidal agent against S. aureus at a concentration of 320 mg/ml, in contrast to Aeromonas, which still showed bacterial growth. The results of the in silico test showed that defensin-aerolysin and defensin-hemolysin was bound to the same active site area. However, the amount of binding energy produced by 69-Defensin-83-aerolysin was higher than all defensin types in BSF against Aeromonas. Chitin and chitosan showed a bond on the active site of aerolysin and hemolysin, but chitosan had a stronger bond than chitin. In silico study also showed the strongest binding affinity of BSF fatty acids to isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase of S. aureus.</Abstract><Abstract>The study showed that methanol extract from BSF prepupae had potential capability as an antibacterial agent against S. aureus than Aeromonas in vitro and in silico.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chitosan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Defensins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diptera</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemolysin Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methanol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Molecular Docking Simulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus aureus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aeromonas</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The most common bones involved with this tumor included the mandible, maxillofacial bones, and nasal sinuses. Definitive diagnosis is based on pathology findings which allow for differentiation with other bone lesions.</Abstract><Abstract>The patient, a 5-year-old intact male Mongrel dog presented with a huge mandibular mass that involved both the right and left mandible, and led to dental occlusion. The radiography was performed and depicted the intense mass with a well-demarcated edge, a short transitional zone between normal and abnormal bone, and a smooth rounded radiopaque appearance. The investigation according to the fine needle aspiration showed the presence of oval to spindle shape cells with poorly malignancy criteria, fatty cells, reactive osteoblasts, and osteoclasts based on a population of spindle-shaped cells, and low numbers of degenerated neutrophils, bacteria, and few macrophages. Then, the radiographic assessments and cytology findings demonstrated the osteoma and were referred for surgical intervention. A unilateral mandibulectomy was performed, and the lesion was sent to the histopathology laboratory. The histopathology evaluation showed osteocyte proliferation without malignancy features. The osteoblast cells also showed no atypical proliferation that endorses the osteoma tumor.</Abstract><Abstract>Although mandibular and maxillofacial bone resection in small animals have different tolerations, this patient became a candidate for surgery for future better nutrition and prevention of facial deformity and dental malocclusion.

After 2 years of use by animals in our group, a horse on canagliflozin was incidentally noted to be hyperlipemic.</Abstract><Abstract>We have been following a cohort of equines (n = 20) treated with SGLT2 inhibitors due to refractory hyperinsulinemia. The animals are owned by members of the Equine Cushing's and Insulin Resistance Group and treated by their attending veterinarians. The index case was a 23 years old gelding with a 2 years history of recurring laminitis that began canagliflozin therapy to control hyperinsulinemia which was no longer responsive to metformin. Between 6 and 10 weeks post start of therapy, significant weight loss was noticed. Two days later he was hospitalized with colic symptoms and hyperlipemia but was bright, alert, and eating well throughout. Canagliflozin was discontinued and triglycerides returned to normal reference values within 10 days. A subsequent study of 19 other horses on SGLT2 inhibitors revealed varying degrees of hypertriglyceridemia, all asymptomatic.</Abstract><Abstract>While this class of drugs holds great promise for cases of refractory hyperinsulinemia and laminitis that do not respond to diet or metformin therapy, hypertriglyceridemia is a potential side effect. In our experience, animals remained asymptomatic and eating well. Further study of hypertriglyceridemia in horses on SGLT2 inhibitors and the possible mitigating effect of diet is indicated.

The tomographic examination of the cavity showed an air content structure, oval to round in shape, with irregular thick hyperattenuating walls measuring approximately 0.4&#160;cm in thickness, occupying more than 30% of the left hemithorax, and pulmonary lobectomy was chosen. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma, with the presence of sparse areas of necrosis and dystrophic calcification.</Abstract><Abstract>The present case successfully diagnosed a malignant bulae, after a surgical remove. The tomographic finds although not confirmatory, suggest a malignant component by the shape and thickness of its wall. The tomographic exam is of great importance, because only through it, it is possible to evaluate if there is lymph node or pleural involvement or the presence of small metastasis foci. There is indication for surgery and histopathological examination of the piece for a definitive diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blister</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Mites such as Sarcoptes scabiei, Otodectes cynotis, Demodex canis, and Cheyletiella spp., commonly affect domestic dogs. However, the impact generated by these mites on populations of wildlife animals and the mechanisms involved in their epidemiological dynamics are still not clear. In recent decades, the migration of populations and their interaction with domestic environments and vice versa have generated a worrying threat due to the transmission of some of these ectoparasites. Some reports have suggested that sarcoptic mange represents an emerging threat to wildlife. Given the outbreaks of greater magnitude and geographical extension. The objective of this review is to contribute to the state of the art of the main mites that cause dermatopathies in members of the Canis lupus familiaris family and other members of the Canidae family. For this, a systematic search was carried out in the Embase and PubMed databases. Infections caused by mites, mainly scabies, continue to be diseases with a worldwide distribution, affecting mammals and humans. Although they are long-standing diseases, the effects that are generated in wild canids are still unknown. A comprehensive evaluation is required to generate guidelines in favor of the conservation of some species of foxes and wolves present in different regions of the world.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Canidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoptes scabiei</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ever since the disease was detected in 1988 in Argentina, many outbreaks have been reported involving both feral swine and dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>At present, in Argentina, Pseudorabies virus (PRV) cases are sporadically reported; however, clinical cases are informed. This study aims to obtain information about the seroprevalence of PRV in wild boars and to isolate and characterize PRV from clinical samples.</Abstract><Abstract>From 2018 to 2019, 78 wild boars' serum samples from Bah&#237;a de Samboromb&#243;n natural reserve were analyzed for antibodies to PRV using a virus neutralization test. Clinical samples from 17 pigs, 2 wild boars, 1 dog, and 1 cat were collected from 2013 to 2019 for viral isolation and detection of the presence of the gD gene by PCR. For sequence analysis, the gC partial gene was amplified.</Abstract><Abstract>Five strains were isolated from the dog, cat, and swine samples. The new PRV strains identified were confirmed by BLAST analysis, which revealed between 99.74% and 100% of similarity to the NIA-3 strain and phylogenetic analysis of the partial gene encoding the gC protein revealed that the PRV strains have divided into two main clades, clade 1 and clade 2.</Abstract><Abstract>This report informed that most new cases of PRV were detected in the central regions of Argentina, where pig production is concentrated. The study in Bah&#237;a de Samboromb&#243;n revealed a high percentage of detection but, the sampling is not representative of that of the rest of the country. Therefore, a systematic sampling effort of wild boar throughout the country should be included in the national program control. Although in Argentina only the inactivated Bartha vaccine is allowed, recombination risk should not be ignored if attenuated vaccines are incorporated into the National control plan. The two strains, one from the cat and one from the dog sample, are directly related to infected swine. The information about clinical cases and molecular characterization of new strains is important for a better understanding of the dynamics of PRV and to promote preventive measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesvirus 1, Suid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Argentina</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pseudorabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The equine carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ) was reported to have variations in its three palmaromedial articulations. Lacking one or more of these articulations has not been radiographically evaluated in Thoroughbred (TB) and Standardbred (SB) racehorses.</Abstract><Abstract>The study aimed to identify the prevalence of the variation in the palmaromedial articulation of the carpometacarpal joint (PM-CMCJ) in TB and SB horses. Additionally, to detect the probability of having each of the three articulations within and between the breeds. Finally, to establish an anatomical description for the different patterns of the articulations in these horses.</Abstract><Abstract>313 dorsopalmar radiographs from 174 horses (117 TB and 57 SB) were used. Three articulations at PM-CMCJ were evaluated based on their presence or absence: the articulations between the second and third carpal bones (C2-C3), the second carpal-second metacarpal (C2-Mc2), and the second and third metacarpal (Mc2-Mc3) bones. The probability of each articulation was determined in the breeds. Depending on the presence/absence of one or more of these articulations in each horse, each group of horses that had the same patterns of articulation was gathered into one category.</Abstract><Abstract>Prevalence of variation in articulations of PM-CMCJ was identified in about 28% of the horses. SB showed a higher variation than TB throughout the comparisons. C2-C3 articulation was significantly the most common articulation, especially in TB (98%). The most common pattern of articulations (73%) was found in category I, which had three articulations whereas three horses grouped in category VI had no palmaromedial articulations.</Abstract><Abstract>The variations in the articulations of PM-CMCJ in TB and SB racehorse might show a breed association. C2-C3 articulation was considerably the most frequent feature and category I was the common pattern of articulations in PM-CMCJ.

Although cranial plate application has been consistently advocated when performing radial MIPO, medial plating affords several purported advantages including improved screw purchase through the wider medial-to-lateral dimension of the radius, the potential to use smaller plates allowing more screws per unit length, and avoidance of extensor tendons which can complicate cranial plate placement in distal diaphyseal or metaphyseal fractures.</Abstract><Abstract>To compare cranial versus medial MIPO applications for the stabilization of diaphyseal radius and ulna fractures in dog cadavers.</Abstract><Abstract>Simulated bilateral antebrachial fractures were stabilized with cranial MIPO on one forelimb and medial MIPO on the contralateral limb, facilitated by a two-ring circular fixator construct. Procedure times and ease, number of fluoroscopic images obtained, and post-procedural frontal and sagittal alignment and radial length were compared between plating groups. The ease of construct placement, fracture reduction, radial approach, and plate application, were subjectively scored 1-5 for each procedure. Paired t-tests were performed to identify significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the two plating groups.</Abstract><Abstract>There was no difference in total or incremental procedural times, subjective ease scores, or the number of fluoroscopic images obtained between plating groups. Both plating groups had comparable post-procedural frontal and sagittal plane alignment.

Eggs were collected from different retail stores in the Aswan governorate, Egypt. Egg samples were subjected to thorough physical and chemical quality evaluation as well as an assessment of antimicrobial residues.</Abstract><Abstract>The results reported that organic eggs were cleaner and had a better odor, less blood, and meat spots, but smaller with more shell cracks than conventional eggs. Chemical analysis of some nutrient contents in the egg yolk revealed significantly higher nutritive values of organic eggs than that of conventional ones as the organic eggs contain significantly higher levels of vitamin A and vitamin D/D3 and significantly lower values of cholesterol, calcium, magnesium, and zinc than those in conventional eggs. Disc diffusion assay has been used for monitoring antimicrobial residues in egg samples. The results have shown that all examined organic eggs were free from antimicrobial residues, while 12% and 8% of conventional egg yolk and white were positive for antimicrobial residues, respectively.</Abstract><Abstract>The study concludes the higher nutritive value of organic eggs compared with the conventional type because of their significantly higher contents of vitamins A and D and their significantly lower contents of cholesterol.

Surgical repair consists of re-apposition of the damaged tendon ends using sutures, but this type of repair is not always possible especially if the tendon has retracted. Tendon augmentation with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) implant is a recent solution to support the sutures and allow the repair of the canine calcaneal tendon.

It is necessary to conduct research on new strains for the development of vaccines.</Abstract><Abstract>The research aims to characterize a novel strain isolated from the CMLV used to produce a CMLV vaccine.</Abstract><Abstract>The objects of the study were the "M-0001" strain isolated from a sample of animals infected with the CMLV during the epidemic. The cultural and reproductive properties of the virus isolate were studied using primary cell lines from primary trypsinized lamb kidney and testicular cell cultures (LK and LT). Other samples included kidney cell lines from transplanted sheep as well as a kidney cell line from transplanted cattle, Vero (transplanted green monkey kidney cell line), and calf trachea. The strain was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-tested and sequenced for characterization purposes.</Abstract><Abstract>The PCR results show that the study sample is species specific and corresponds to the CMLV by the size of the cumulative amplifications, which is 241 bp. Given the maximum percentage of a sequence match analyzed by the BLAST algorithm based on the international database and the results of phylogenetic analysis, the M0001 sample was determined to belong to the CMLV (gene bank inventory number KP768318.1).</Abstract><Abstract>The sample "M0001" is located on the same branch with a representative from CMLV. Among the cell cultures tested, the LK and LT cell lines were the most sensitive to the isolated CMLV isolate. Reproducing the virus in these cell cultures remains stable even after 15 consecutive passes. The cytopathic effect of the virus was less pronounced and low in transplanted cell lines, and the cytopathic effect was no longer apparent in the third passage. A genome alignment of the virus has identified potentially conserved sites, and analysis of loci in different virus types revealed one maximally conserved locus. An epizootic strain of the camelina virus "M-0001" candidate to produce vaccines for the camels was obtained. An experimental vaccine sample based on an isolated and charred camellia virus will be created in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chlorocebus aethiops</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Culture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epithelial Cells</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It caused mild respiratory symptoms and a drop in egg production in poultry. Outbreaks of AI-H9N2 have occurred in poultry since the 1990s in many countries in USA, Europe, and Asia. Recently, outbreaks of H9N2 in commercial chicken were recorded in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. Furthermore, numerous studies demonstrated that co-infection with AI H9N2 and other pathogens results in severe respiratory illness with high mortality in broiler chickens. Outbreaks of respiratory disease with variations in mortality rate were recorded in broiler flocks growing in the southwest of Tripoli in Libya.</Abstract><Abstract>The present study was conducted to explain the variation of mortality rate on broiler flocks growing in the southwest area of Tripoli by detection of AI H9N2 antibodies and antigens.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 453 sera samples, 60 tracheal swabs, and 60 cloacal swabs were collected from unvaccinated broiler flocks against avian influenza. Specific avian influenza type A antibodies were detected by using the Elisa test, and specific AI-H9N2 antibodies were detected by using the HI test, whereas specific AI-H9N2 antigens were detected in tracheal and cloacal swabs by using One-Step RT-PCR (M gene) technique.</Abstract><Abstract>Respiratory diseases with high variations in mortality rate were recorded in broiler flocks growing in the southwest of Tripoli in Libya; the broiler mortality rate in Twisha farms was higher than other farms (62.2% and 11%, respectively). Whereas avian influenza type A antibodies were detected at a high level in Twisha and other farms (95.2%, and 76.7%, respectively). The positive samples for AI type A were tested for AI H9N2 using the HI test. Interestingly the percentage of AI-H9N2 antibodies was quite similar in high and low mortality regions (53.4% and 46.8%, respectively). Additionally, AI-H9N2 antigens were detected only in tracheal swabs in Twisha farm 3, Al-Maamoura, and Ber Al-Tota districts.</Abstract><Abstract>This study confirmed the endemic of AI- H9N2 in broiler flocks in the southwest of Tripoli-Libya.

Animal models play a crucial role in studying PCa pathology and discovering novel approaches to prevent, detect and treat this disease. However, the challenge of translational medicine is the limited reproducibility and inadequate recapitulation of human conditions in animal models. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the prostate gland among distinct animal species is essential for better translating research findings to clinical practice. This review aims to compare and describe the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the prostate gland in humans, rats, and dogs, emphasizing the relevant features. Despite the anatomical differences between these species, rats are a valuable model to study human prostate diseases, once they share some features implicated in carcinogenesis in humans. Dogs, on the other hand, are considered the best model for studying PCa due to the development of spontaneous cancer with a higher incidence when compared with other animals and the development of bone metastases. Moreover, the lymphatic system and the sentinel lymph node role and mapping are similar in dogs and humans. However, it is important to recognize that no animal model can directly mimic all aspects of PCa as the human prostate is anatomically different from that of rats and dogs. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and understand the intra- and interspecies variability when translating research findings into clinical practice. This review highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of the anatomical differences between the prostate gland in humans, rats, and dogs when selecting the appropriate animal model for studying PCa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Translational Science, Biomedical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

From each colony, 300 worker bees were taken as samples, put in container filled with 100 ml of alcohol, and transported to the Honey bee Laboratory-Plant Protection Department at the University of Tripoli's. The parasites were separated from the bees and identified, and the infestation rates were calculated.</Abstract><Abstract>The study of the parasite distribution clearly showed that Varroa mites were present in all regions. However, the degree of mite density varies not only between apiaries but also between colonies in the same apiary, while the bee louse, Barulla coeca, was detected in 23.1% and 5.8% of apiaries in the western region and southern region of Libya, respectively. On the other hand, all the inspected apiaries in the northern region were not infested.</Abstract><Abstract>Lack of knowledge about honey bee parasites, poor management practices, and the lack of proper distance between hives of migrated apiaries have been attributed as the possible reason for the spread of these two parasites, especially the Varroa mites in the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Bees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phthiraptera</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Varroidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Libya</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethanol</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Group C was considered as a control. Groups T1, T2, T3, and T4 were given probiotics, antibiotics, humic acid for the first 7 days and humic acid for 42 days, respectively. Samples were collected on days 27 and 42 to assess the humoral immunity, cellular immunity, lymphoid organs weight, and differential leucocyte count (DLC).</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in antibodies titer against Newcastle disease virus in chickens given humic acid (T4) daily for 42 days as compared to the control. There was also a significant increase in antibodies titer in the T1 group given probiotic for the first week lasting up to day 27 as compared to the control. The skin thickness of T4 group showed a significant increase as compared to T1 and T2 groups after 24 hours of DNCB challenge. After 48 hours, the thickness was still significantly higher in the T4 group as compared to other groups except for the control. There were no significant differences in Bursa of Fabricius/Body weight (%) between the groups. Spleen/Body weight (%) was significantly higher in the control group and T1 than the other groups on day 42. The DLC remains normal in all groups.</Abstract><Abstract>It is concluded that the humic acid has a stimulant and strengthening effect on the humoral and cellular immune system when given daily to broiler chickens. Moreover, the use of humic acid and probiotics with good hygiene in the first week of age may alternate the use of antibiotics which could be toxic and raise bacterial resistance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humic Substances</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Probiotics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In order to be safe and increase number of bee colonies for pollination, the breeding of queens is necessary. For several decades, bees were selected on economic and behavioral aspects. With the appearance of the neozootic mite Varroa destructor beekeepers were forced to adapt their methods. Varroa destructor can act as a vector for many different bee pathogenic viruses and by this potentiates its devastating impact.</Abstract><Abstract>Methods of rearing queens were not evaluated since the mites' appearance. Besides scientific approaches, viruses received too little attention in regard to the rearing process of honeybee queens. Herein, we present a detailed analysis of virus abundances [Aparavirus, acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV); Triatovirus, black queen cell virus (BQCV); Cripavirus, chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV); and Iflaviruses, deformed wings virus (DWV), Sacbrood virus (SBV), VDV-1] in breeding hives, donating first instar larvae, hives that are nursing these larvae until the pupa stage, and on queens of Apis mellifera in a breeding apiary.</Abstract><Abstract>Nurse and donor colonies of the queen-rearing process were sampled in the year 2020 and analyzed by RT qPCR. Virus quantifications were correlated with queen mortalities and seasonal effects.</Abstract><Abstract>Virus detections increased in reared queens, however, the elevated virus titers did not increase the mortality of the queens until their exclosure. Moreover, we observed a lower interrelation between virus abundance in queens and their original donor colonies, than between nurse hives and their nursed queens.</Abstract><Abstract>The bee pathogenic viruses ABPV, BQCV, CBPV, DWV, SBV, and VDV-1 do not influence the mortality of bee queens during the rearing process.

In dogs with particular somatotypes, such as brachymorphic dogs, breed-specific echocardiographic values are needed for a proper echocardiographic interpretation. Nowadays, the Pug represents one of the most popular brachymorphic canine breeds worldwide. However, data on echocardiographic measurements in this breed are currently limited.</Abstract><Abstract>We aimed to determine echocardiographic values in a population of apparently healthy Pugs, and to assess the possible effects of body weight (BW), age, and sex on selected echocardiographic variables, with particular emphasis on those related to the left-sided cardiac chambers.</Abstract><Abstract>Apparently healthy Pugs underwent a full physical examination, a 1-minute six-lead electrocardiogram, and a complete transthoracic echocardiography. Twenty-four echocardiographic variables were measured by combining M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler modalities, and relative values were determined by applying the statistical procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Moreover, the effect of selected demographic variables on echocardiographic measurements was tested using a linear mixed model.</Abstract><Abstract>The investigation included 86 Pugs. Echocardiographic values were provided for each variable and compared with previous veterinary literature. A statistically significant effect of BW, age, and sex was documented for several of the tested variables. Doppler examination demonstrated a trivial pulmonary regurgitation in 24/86 (27.9%) Pugs. Moreover, a persistent left cranial vena cava was suspected in 4/86 (4.7%) dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>Echocardiographic features of the Pug were addressed and echocardiographic values were made available for clinical use. Because our findings were obtained using a standardized echocardiographic analysis in a population of 86 healthy Pugs, they may act as a reliable guide for an accurate echocardiographic interpretation in this breed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In canine and human medicine, dermatologic adverse effects of subcutaneous furosemide (SF) have been documented; conversely, no prior case has been published describing skin reactions to this therapeutic protocol in cats. In this report, we describe, for the first time in feline medicine, a suspected dermatologic adverse effect after SF in a cat.</Abstract><Abstract>A 2-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented for CHF associated with lung edema and pleural effusion. Echocardiography revealed asymmetric left ventricular myocardial thickening and severe left atrial dilation. The cat was hospitalized and initially treated with oxygen, intravenous furosemide, and clopidogrel. After discharge, the route of administration of furosemide was switched from intravenous to oral. Within the following 2 weeks, the cat experienced two relapses of lung edema despite the progressive increase of the furosemide dose, the addition of spironolactone and adherence to the therapeutic protocol by the owners. The dose of furosemide was further increased and its route of administration at home was switched from oral to parental. As the owner was not able to administrate intramuscular injections, SF was prescribed. This allowed the prevention of further episodes of lung edema. However, although the cat had never presented skin problems before, multiple well-defined circular, crusted ulcerative cutaneous lesions associated with alopecia developed at the sites of furosemide injections 2 weeks later. After ruling out several differential diagnoses for these lesions, a rare side effect of furosemide, not yet described in cats but already known in canine and human medicine, was strongly suspected as the possible cause. Therefore, the ongoing injectable formulation of furosemide was interrupted and substituted with an alternative brand, maintaining the same dose and route of administration. Thanks to this change, the dermal ulcerations disappeared within 1 month. Subsequently, the cat experienced neither further skin problems nor a recurrence of lung edema.</Abstract><Abstract>Although SF is sometimes prescribed in small animal practice, it should be noticed that this may lead to dermatologic adverse reactions in the cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Furosemide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Failure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edema</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A complete ophthalmologic examination including electroretinography and ocular ultrasound was performed. After conventional phacoemulsification, a marked PCO obstructing the visual axis was found in five cases, previously diagnosed by ultrasound in the sixth. An axial posterior capsulorhexis (APC) was performed in all cases, before or after implantation of the intraocular lens (IOL). For the four cases implanted before APC, the posterior capsule (PC) was visualized either by positioning the IOL laterally in the bag with viscoelastic or through the optic of the implant. After perforation of the PC with a 30-Gauge needle, APC was initiated with Vannas curved scissors, then finalized with Utrata forceps to obtain a circular axial opening (3 mm diameter).

Although some cases of L. serrata infection have been reported in dogs, the epidemiology of this parasite remains largely unknown in developed countries. In recent years, canine linguatulosis has been repeatedly linked to cases of imported infections. This study aims to focus attention on this uncommon parasite through the presentation of a case report and an overview of the literature.</Abstract><Abstract>A 1-year-old intact female Borzoi imported from Romania to Italy sneezed spontaneously a worm-like parasite specimen. Morphological and molecular diagnosis identified the parasite as a female of the zoonotic pentastomid L. serrata (so-called European tongue worm) that lives in the nasopharyngeal tract of canids. Eggs of Linguatula were detected in the feces. Molecular identification (99%-100% homology) was based on DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction of a 700-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, and alignment with BLAST analysis. Due to the possibility of other adult or juvenile specimens of the parasite still occurring in the dog, a treatment attempt with a combination of febantel/pyrantel/praziquantel was made. No parasite eggs were detected in fecal samples after the drug was administered. Endoscopy confirmed the absence of adult parasites and slight pathological changes. A follow-up examination conducted 3 months after the treatment did not reveal any clinical and laboratory abnormalities.</Abstract><Abstract>Linguatula serrata appears to be currently prevalent in some European countries, but there are no recent extensive studies on the prevalence of canine linguatulosis, so the parasite frequently remains undetected and unreported in dogs as the diagnosis is often overlooked. Parasites not commonly found such as L. serrata can become increasingly prevalent and may be detected in imported dogs. Therefore, veterinarians must be aware of the possible presence of uncommon and exotic pathogens in these dogs, be able to recognize the relevant clinical signs, and diagnose the infection quickly. This will improve the prognosis in individual dogs, reduces the risk of possible public health implications, and reduces the risk of uncommon and exotic pathogens establishing new endemic foci.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pentastomida</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Romania</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Canidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest control and prevention strategies against NiV, focusing on vaccine development, antiviral drug discovery, early diagnosis, surveillance, and high-level biosecurity measures. Advancements in vaccine research, including live-attenuated vaccines, virus-like particles, and mRNA-based vaccines, hold promise for preventing NiV infections. In addition, antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, ribavirin, and favipiravir, have the potential to inhibit NiV replication. Early diagnosis through molecular and serological assays, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction plays a crucial role in timely detection. Surveillance efforts encompassing cluster-based and case-based systems enhance outbreak identification and provide valuable insights into transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the implementation of high-level biosecurity measures in agriculture, livestock practices, and healthcare settings is essential to minimize transmission risks. Collaboration among researchers, public health agencies, and policymakers is pivotal in refining and implementing these strategies to effectively control and prevent NiV outbreaks and safeguard public health on a global scale.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nipah Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Henipavirus Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cases were categorized based on whether an underlying etiology had been established in cases with confirmed etiology, idiopathic, and inconclusive cases. All cases had a minimum of 12-month follow-up unless an underlying etiology had been established. Population characteristics, clinical signs, diagnostic investigation features, and results were reported.</Abstract><Abstract>72 cases of uveitis were included, of which male cats and domestic breeds were overrepresented. An underlying etiology was determined in 23.6% of cases: 9.7% had infectious diseases, 5.6% had systemic neoplasia, 4.2% had primary ocular neoplasia, and 4.2% had metabolic disease. Idiopathic uveitis comprised 37.5% of cases, and the remaining 38.9% were inconclusive, of which 35.7% died or were euthanased within the follow-up period. Among the study population, no significant age difference was found between cats with idiopathic disease or confirmed etiology. The unilateral disease was reported in 56.9% of cases and was not different across the idiopathic cases and confirmed etiology groups. The most common ophthalmic clinical sign was an aqueous flare, followed by keratic precipitates and hypotony. Iris color change (p = 0.015) and the presence of an intraocular mass (p = 0.025) were associated with an underlying etiology.</Abstract><Abstract>Idiopathic uveitis was found to be the most common diagnosis in this study population.

Dogs were classified into three groups: the control group (G0), the group receiving topical 1% CsA once per day (G1), and the group receiving topical 1% CsA twice daily (G2).</Abstract><Abstract>Ninety-two client-owned dogs (163 eyes) of different breeds, ages, and gender fulfilled the inclusion criteria. When compared to G0, where the eyes significantly increased COD (p &lt; 0.001), G1 and G2 significantly decreased COD (p &lt; 0.001). In fact, the probability of reducing COD was about three times higher in G2 than in G1, being nearly the same for the right [odds ratio (OR) = 2.94; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.55-15.78] and left eye (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 0.49-17.26). In addition, for each additional month of treatment in G2, the probability of reducing COD increased significantly (OR = 1.12; 95%CI = 1.00-1.26 for the right eye and OR = 1.16; 95%CI = 1.02-1.32 for the left eye).</Abstract><Abstract>Long-term treatment with topical 1% CsA eyedrops significantly improved CCD in dogs, being the probability of reducing COD higher when applying the treatment twice daily.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ophthalmic Solutions</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although it has been suggested that its occurrence may be related to the immune targeting of erythroid precursors, this pathogenesis has not been established. PIMA is mainly treated with glucocorticoids, and in cases where glucocorticoids alone are not effective, immunosuppressants are also used as combination therapy. However, not all cases of PIMA go into remission after these treatments.</Abstract><Abstract>Two dogs with severe nonregenerative anemia diagnosed as PIMA based on the results of clinical pathological examinations, including bone marrow examination, were treated with whole-blood transfusion and immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine. However, these treatments failed to achieve remission of PIMA. Therefore, concomitant administration of oclacitinib, which is a Janus kinase-1 inhibitor that has been applied recently to the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, was performed; this combined regimen improved the anemia and achieved complete remission of PIMA.</Abstract><Abstract>Oclacitinib may be an option for the treatment of PIMA in dogs failing to achieve remission with conventional immunosuppressive therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisolone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Potassium Iodide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The main in vivo method, the stable test, is considered a defining methodology. In Uruguay, the Rhipicephalus microplus (R. microplus) strain Mozo is used as the standard susceptible strain by the regulatory authorities. In vitro techniques applied both on adult and larvae stages are validated by FAO and can serve as an orientation diagnosis of the resistance profile developed in field conditions. An alternative was proposed as a modification of the larval immersion test (LIT), where syringes were used seeking to reduce the work necessary to perform the original technique, resulting in the syringe immersion test (SIT).</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this study was to expand the SIT for the characterization of sensitivity to Macrocyclic Lactones (MLs) in R. microplus and provide information on field strain sensitivity of R. microplus larvae.</Abstract><Abstract>Log-logistic dose-response model for Ivermectin (IVM), Doramectin (DRM), and Moxidectin (MOX) were performed using concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 20.0 ppm (n = 6, 3 replicates per level on each drug). Larvae sensitivity results were determined after 24 hours of incubation at 27&#176;C/90% RH, counting live/dead larvae. The final model will be decided as the best fit according to the model selection AIC criteria for each drug. Pharmacodynamic parameters [lower limit, slope, and effective dose at different levels (ED20, ED50, ED80, and ED95)] and its 95% confidence interval were considered for drug comparison.</Abstract><Abstract>Dose-response models were fitted for IVM, DRM, and MOX. MOX had the lowest ED50 of the three drugs, implying that MOX is of higher potency (two folds) when compared to IVM and DRM on R. microplus larvae using SIT. DRM had a different slope compared to IVM and MOX (p &lt; 0.05), while IVM and MOX showed a similar slope (p &gt; 0.05).</Abstract><Abstract>This study allowed us to standardize the technique for larvae immersion for each ML, granting a new tool for in vitro test as a screening technique for tick sensitivity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syringes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhipicephalus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immersion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Larva</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biological Assay</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Each animal underwent a complete clinical evaluation as well as hematological analyses, lipid profile indices, liver functions, cardio-thoracic radiography, and echocardiography to confirm no diseased conditions were detected. The study was conducted on healthy buffaloes (n = 30) in Assiut Governorate, Egypt.</Abstract><Abstract>The obtained results reported healthy buffaloes with normal clinical findings as well as indices of blood pictures and serum biochemicals that were within the reference intervals. Radiography revealed a free reticulum and a well-defined diaphragm. The heart was seen as a typical radio-opaque organ. Ultrasonographically, using grayscale B-mode and M-mode, the heart was commonly imaged from the left fourth intercostal space. Different echocardiographic views were described, including the four chamber view, i.e., right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), tricuspid valve (TCV), left atrium, left ventricle, mitral valve, and interventricular septum (IVS), and the right ventricular outflow tract, i.e., RA, TCV, RV, pulmonary artery (PA), and pulmonary valve. Cross sections in each of the apex and base of the heart were described. Echocardiographic dimensions during cardiac diastole and systole, including diameters and wall thickness of each of the atria and ventricles, were demonstrated. Interventricular septal thickness wall thickness as well as diameters of the aorta and PA, were stated.</Abstract><Abstract>The work tried to put reference values on the normal echocardiographic dimensions using 2-D B-mode gray scale ultrasonography in healthy adult buffaloes. These echocardiographic reference dimensions with normal echocardiographic imaging will be very helpful in enhancing the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasounds for recognizing abnormal findings related to cardiac disorders.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diastole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Ventricles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records were accessed for details of signalment, history, management, and follow-up. Histopathology was used to confirm the diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma and assess the surgical margins. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a minority of cases with poorly differentiated solid tumours to support vascular lineage.</Abstract><Abstract>Seven eyes from seven horses (five geldings and two mares) with a mean age of 16 years and median of 18 years (range 10-21 years) met the criteria. Serosanguinous discharge was seen in six eyes. All eyes were managed surgically; 4 by exenteration and 3 by conjunctivectomy/keratectomy. Adjunctive cryotherapy was performed in two eyes. Metastatic disease in the ipsilateral parotid salivary gland, confirmed with histopathology, was seen in one horse. Surgical margins were clear in all but one eye. Solar elastosis was noted in five eyes. All horses were healthy at the last follow-up (0.2-5 years, mean 2.9 years, and median 2 years).</Abstract><Abstract>Equine conjunctival haemangiosarcoma is rare.

Review of its role in human health or diseases.</Title>	<Abstract>Camels play an important role in the pastoral mode of life by fulfilling basic demands of livelihood. Various pathologies, such as tuberculosis, hemorrhoids, ascites, increased size of the abdomen, gas colic, anemia, and abdominal tumors, were treated with animal urine, including camels, horses, donkeys, sheep, goats, elephants, and buffalo. Thirty different compounds were analyzed in camel urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. For inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis, 28 important elements were analyzed in the urine of both camel and bovine. It was found that the inorganic elements are almost similar, except sodium, potassium, iron, zinc, and magnesium are higher in levels in camel urine, while chromium is high in bovine urine. Camel urine also contains different nanoparticles, crystals, and nano-rods with varying shapes and sizes, which offer potent selective cytotoxic activity against several lines of cancer cells. It is believed that the camel's urine has a therapeutic effect for a wide range of diseases such as chill, fever, or even tumors; therefore, it has been consumed in the Arabian Peninsula for a long time. Usually, patients take it directly or by mixing a few drops with camel milk. Camel urine is also used for therapeutic purposes, most widely in Asia, Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. The religious aspect of using camel urine in treatment comes from the fact that there has been convincing evidence that the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) suggested the use of camel urine to treat his companions who were suffering from abdominal pains at that time. The camel's urine has anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. It also has hepato-protective and cardiovascular effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United Kingdom</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, it has been associated with dose-dependent cardiovascular depression. Therefore, the administration of liposoluble, intravenous (IV)-administered injectable induction agents, such as alfaxalone, is recommended to be based on the dog's lean body mass (LBM).</Abstract><Abstract>To determine the influence of body condition score (BCS) on IV alfaxalone dose requirements to achieve endotracheal intubation in dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>Prospective clinical study. A group of 34 dogs undergoing GA for diagnostic and/or surgical procedures, body weight (BW) &gt; 4 kg, BCS &gt; 2, age 1-14 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASAs) classification I-III. Dogs were allocated to two different groups according to their BCS: non-overweight group (NOW) BCS: 3-5 and over-weight group (OW) BCS: 6-9. All dogs were premedicated IV with methadone 0.2 mg kg[-1], and anesthesia was induced by a slow IV infusion of alfaxalone at 1 mg kg[-1] minute[-1], delivered with a syringe driver, until loss of jaw tone and no/minimal gagging reflex sufficient to allow endotracheal intubation was achieved. The total dose of alfaxalone and the occurrence of post-induction apnoea were recorded.The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test for normality. A Chi-square test was performed to compare the incidence of post-induction apnoea between groups, and the Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the induction dose of alfaxalone between groups.

Surgical correction is often the first treatment choice, however, nonsurgical methods, such as urine removal via urinary catheters and abdominal drains, have been successfully performed in foals.</Abstract><Abstract>Two foals were referred to the Equine Perinatology Unit for suspicion of uroperitoneum. The diagnosis was confirmed by hematobiochemical and ultrasound examinations, thus cystorrhaphy and cystoplasty were attempted. Surgeons found a lesion in the dorsocranial margin of the bladder (Case 1) and a tear in the pelvic urethra (Case 2); in the first case, the defect was routinely repaired, while the last lesion was impossible to repair due to its localization. A urinary catheter was left in place in both cases. Uroperitoneum recurred 72 hours after the surgery in both foals: a second surgical correction was not recommended due to the localization of the tears and conservative treatment, with the placement of a 32F chest tube in the most ventral part of the abdomen, was preferred. Abdominal drains were removed 5-7 days after surgery, while urinary catheters were left in place for up to 7-8 days. Colts' conditions improved during hospitalizations. Two months after bladder surgery, Case 1 was euthanized due to multiple adhesions between the small intestine and the abdominal wall. Case 2 was still alive one year postoperatively.</Abstract><Abstract>Although it cannot be considered the first choice for the treatment of uroperitoneum in the foal, nonsurgical treatment was successful in both cases in the short-term follow-up.

The aim of this study was to describe clinical and endoscopic features, and outcomes of ubRMS in dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>Dogs undergoing transurethral endoscopy and with a histological diagnosis of ubRMS were retrospectively collected. Seven dogs with a median age of 18 months (range 6-32 months) were included in this retrospective, multicenter, and descriptive study. Median tumor size was 58 mm (range 30-65 mm), and tumor location was bladder neck in three cases, trigone in two cases, and bladder body in two cases. Two dogs had monolateral ureteral obstruction. Two dogs presented with regional lymphadenopathy and one dog had lung lesions suggestive of metastatic disease. A grape-like mass was reported in four cases and solid in two, with variable consistency (two friables, two firms, and two not reported). Tumor treatments included surgery in three cases, surgery, and adjuvant doxorubicin in one case, and palliative therapy in three cases. The overall median survival time (ST) was 45 days. STs were shorter (range 20-45 days) for dogs treated with palliative care than for dogs treated with curative-intent treatment (range 70-120 days).</Abstract><Abstract>ubRMS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in young dogs presenting with bladder masses. In this study, ubRMS confirmed its aggressive clinical behavior. Surgery and chemotherapy seem to increase STs but the prognosis remains poor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhabdomyosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Environmental contamination by oocysts excreted by cats as definitive hosts affects the spread of this disease. Wild rats as rodents can be used as an indicator of environmental contamination by oocysts, considering that rats have a habit of living in dirty environments and can be infected by oocysts from the environment.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to detect toxoplasmosis from tissue cysts and serological tests in wild rats as an indicator of environmental contamination in Surabaya.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 100 wild rats collected from Surabaya were collected in five areas (West, East, Central, North, and South of Surabaya) obtained from three trapping locations: housing, dense settlements, and markets. All samples were examined microscopically for parasitological tests through the brain tissue samples, and the serum was examined using the toxoplasma modified agglutination test to detect the presence of IgG and Immunoglobulin M (IgM).</Abstract><Abstract>This research used 100 wild rat samples, 77 Rattus tanezumi and 33 Rattus norvegicus, with evidence of 31% in serology and active infection with 19% tissue cyst. The results showed that the seroprevalence of T. gondii in wild rats was 31% (30% for IgG and 1% for IgM). Tissue cysts in the rat brain samples tested were 19% (19/100). The IgG prevalence rate in female rats was 25% (8/32), while for males, it was 32.3% (22/68). The highest seropositive IgG from densely populated settlements was 50%, markets were 25.8%, and housing was 12.1%. The highest seropositive IgM from densely populated settlements was 2.8%. Population density and the presence of cats are factors supporting the high seropositive rate at the trapping location.</Abstract><Abstract>This study revealed that there has been toxoplasmosis contamination in Surabaya with evidence of 31% in serology and active infection with 19% tissue cyst. It is necessary for controlling with surveillance in cats to prevent transmission in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indonesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Protozoan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxoplasmosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxoplasma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oocysts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulin M</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulin G</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodent Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In dogs, no reports have been described as acute respiratory failure following hypertensive crisis. Here, we report the clinical presentation, course, and treatment of acute respiratory failure following the hypertensive crisis in a dog with presumed pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.</Abstract><Abstract>A 12-year-old neutered male toy poodle was referred for the diagnostic evaluation of a right adrenal gland mass. The dog suddenly exhibited severe dyspnea with abnormal hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg) 15 minutes after recovery from the anesthesia for the computed tomography (CT) examination. Pulmonary CT and ultrasonography findings suggested acute onset of severe pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema was treated with mechanical ventilation (pressure-support ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure) and negative fluid balance after the administration of furosemide. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was successful 24 hours after the onset of respiratory failure. Finally, the dog was discharged 3 days after weaning from ventilation without complications.</Abstract><Abstract>This report outlines a case of acute respiratory failure following a hypertensive crisis requiring mechanical ventilatory management in a dog. The onset and progression of pulmonary edema were extremely rapid. However, improvement in pulmonary edema was also rapid. Hemodynamic stability, in addition to prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapeutic intervention, including mechanical ventilation, may have contributed to the good prognosis of pulmonary edema following hypertensive crisis in a dog, which we attribute to a catecholamine storm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pheochromocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertensive Crisis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Edema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Changes in blood parameters are a meaningful manifestation of physiological and pathological changes in an organism.</Abstract><Abstract>Therefore, the present study was conducted to analyze and compare hematological and biochemical parameters between blood profiles of Lohi sheep naturally infected and uninfected with Babesia ovis, the main causative agent of ovine babesiosis.</Abstract><Abstract>Initially, blood and serum samples from 67 Lohi sheep were collected, DNA was extracted and babesial infection was detected through polymerase chain reaction. The overall infection rate of B. ovis was 37% (25/67). Sixteen infected (experiment group) and 16 uninfected (control group) sheep that were apparently healthy with no history of previous treatment for babesiosis, were selected for hemato-biochemical analysis. Blood samples were analyzed through an automatic CBC analyzer, while serum collected from gel vacutainers was analyzed for blood urea, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and total bilirubin. Each parameter was compared between infected and uninfected animals using a paired t-test in Minitab Express&#8482; software for statistical analyses.</Abstract><Abstract>Erythron comparison showed a highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) decrease in RBC, hemoglobin, and Hct. A nonsignificant increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and RDW-standard deviation (RDW-SD), while a nonsignificant decrease in mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and MCH concentration (MCHC) values was recorded in infected sheep. Leukon comparison showed a significantly low level of total leukocyte (p &lt; 0.001) in infected sheep. Platelet (Plt) along with platelet crit (Pct) and platelet distribution width (PDW) were nonsignificantly higher, whereas a nonsignificant decrease in mean Plt volume was recorded in infected sheep as compared to uninfected animals. Among biochemical parameters, blood urea, BUN, and total bilirubin showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05), while creatinine showed a nonsignificant difference.</Abstract><Abstract>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on hemato-biochemical changes associated with babesiosis in the Lohi breed. Consistent with hemolytic anemia, these data would justify physical examination and, together with the medical history, would provide an excellent basis for the diagnosis of babesiosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bilirubin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>38107233</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Tracking lethal threat: in-depth review of rabies.</Title>	<Abstract>An infectious disease known as rabies (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) causes severe damage to mammals' central nervous systems (CNS). This illness has been around for a very long time. The majority of human cases of rabies take place in underdeveloped regions of Africa and Asia. Following viral transmission, the Rhabdovirus enters the peripheral nervous system and proceeds to the CNS, where it targets the encephalon and produces encephalomyelitis. Postbite prophylaxis requires laboratory confirmation of rabies in both people and animals. All warm-blooded animals can transmit the Lyssavirus infection, while the virus can also develop in the cells of cold-blooded animals. In the 21st century, more than 3 billion people are in danger of contracting the rabies virus in more than 100 different nations, resulting in an annual death toll of 50,000-59,000. There are three important elements in handling rabies disease in post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), namely wound care, administration of anti-rabies serum, and anti-rabies vaccine. Social costs include death, lost productivity as a result of early death, illness as a result of vaccination side effects, and the psychological toll that exposure to these deadly diseases has on people. Humans are most frequently exposed to canine rabies, especially youngsters and the poor, and there are few resources available to treat or prevent exposure, making prevention of human rabies challenging.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabies Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabies virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38107234</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Variations in metabolic parameters of in vitro matured porcine oocytes after vitrification-warming.</Title>	<Abstract>As the porcine oocyte is the most sensitive to low-temperature damage, it has been difficult to cryopreserve compared to those from other domestic animals. However, at present, vitrification is used as a method for the cryopreservation of both oocytes and embryos in this species.</Abstract><Abstract>Our aim was to analyze alterations in metabolic parameters in vitrified-warmed in vitro matured porcine oocytes at different post-warming recuperation times. In addition, metaphase II plate recovery time analysis, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection were carried out to evaluate oocyte recovery capacity.</Abstract><Abstract>Oocytes were vitrified-warmed and then incubated for 0, 3, or 21 hours post-warming to assess biochemical parameters.</Abstract><Abstract>Oocyte viability and morphology were not affected by vitrification-warming. Cytosolic oxidative status, active mitochondria, and reactive oxygen species levels presented changes at the different time points in control and vitrified-warmed oocytes (p &lt; 0.05) as well as differences between both groups (p &lt; 0.05). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels remained constant throughout different recuperation times but were significantly lower in vitrified-warmed oocytes (p &lt; 0.05). Metaphase II plate recovery occurred mostly between 3 and 4 hours post-warming, but the percentage of metaphase II was reduced by vitrification-warming. Sperm head decondensation and pronuclear formation capacities were not modified.</Abstract><Abstract>In conclusion, vitrification-warming generates biochemical alterations in porcine oocytes that would be, in part, responsible for affecting their performance. Therefore, although the technique is a valid alternative for porcine oocyte cryopreservation, the protocols should be adapted to minimize those alterations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitrification</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryopreservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fertilization in Vitro</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
