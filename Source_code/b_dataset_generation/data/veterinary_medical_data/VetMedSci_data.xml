Infected cats often remain asymptomatic for several years before immune dysfunction leads to an increased risk for the development of systemic diseases, neoplasia and opportunistic infections. FIV is structurally related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the pathogenesis of FIV-related disease is similar to that seen in HIV-infected patients. Observational studies have documented an association between low plasma vitamin D and HIV infection. Vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with HIV-related disease progression, morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that vitamin D status, as assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, are lower in cats with FIV infection compared to healthy control cats. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in 20 healthy cats, 39 hospitalized ill cats and 59 cats infected with FIV. Cats which were FIV infected had significantly lower 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control cats. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not significantly different between FIV-infected cats and hospitalized ill cats. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether vitamin D status influences the prognosis of cats infected with FIV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28713573</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>A monograph proposing the use of canine mammary tumours as a model for the study of hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes in humans.</Title>	<Abstract>Canines are excellent models for cancer studies due to their similar physiology and genomic sequence to humans, companion status and limited intra-breed heterogeneity. Due to their affliction to mammary cancers, canines can serve as powerful genetic models of hereditary breast cancers. Variants within known human breast cancer susceptibility genes only explain a fraction of familial cases. Thus, further discovery is necessary but such efforts have been thwarted by genetic heterogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity is key, and studying isolated human populations have helped in the endeavour. An alternative is to study dog pedigrees, since artificial selection has resulted in extreme homogeneity. Identifying the genetic predisposition to canine mammary tumours can translate to human discoveries - a strategy currently underutilized. To explore this potential, we reviewed published canine mammary tumour genetic studies and proposed benefits of next generation sequencing canine cohorts to facilitate moving beyond incremental advances.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Horses were groomed for collection of ectoparasites. Out of the horses examined, 164 came from Fundong, 80 from Acha, 30 from Fongo-Tongo, 30 from Fokoue and 17 from Dschang, all of which were infested with ectoparasites. Five hundred and seventy-three (573) horses came from Banso and 99.48% were infested by ectoparasites. From the results obtained, three species of hard ticks (Boophilus decoloratus, Amblyomma hebraeum and Hyalomma rufipes) and one species of biting lice (Bovicola equi) were identified. Boophilus decoloratus (66%) had the highest prevalence per locality, followed by A. hebraeum (18%), H. rufipes (11%) and B. equi (5%). Boophilus decoloratus infested horses of all ages, sex or colour. Meanwhile, A. hebraeum and H. rufipes had a higher prevalence in adult male horses. Mono-parasitic infestation (69%) was more common than poly-parasitic infestation (31%). Only three horses were free from infestation with ectoparasites. Understanding the biology, epidemiology and economic impact on the equine industry is important for public health and disease prevention programmes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

While the international wildlife trade represents over US $300 billion per year industry involving exchange of billions of individual animals, animal products, and plants as traditional medicines, meat from wild animals, trophies, live exotic pets, commercial products and food, surveillance and reporting of OIE-Listed diseases in wildlife are often opportunistic. We reviewed peer-reviewed literature for reports of 73 OIE-Listed terrestrial animal diseases in wild animals and found 528 possible wild animal hosts using our methodology. Not all host-pathogen relationships indicate that a particular species serves an epidemiologically significant role in the transmission of disease, but improved reporting of infections in wild animals along with clinical and pathological findings would contribute to improved One Health risk assessments.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Most infected horses show mild clinical signs and mortality is usually very low. EEV is closely related and similarly transmitted to other, more pathogenic and economically important, orbiviruses such as African horse sickness virus (AHSV), bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV), and may serve as an indicator for possible transmission of the latter. Israel has been reported to be endemic for EEV since 2001. This study was initiated to re-evaluate the current seroprevalence and risk factors for EEV exposure in Israel, and to assess, for the first time, the seroprevalence of EEV in Palestine and Jordan. Three hundred and sixteen serum samples were collected from apparently healthy horses at 21 farms in Israel, 66 horses at nine farms in Palestine and 100 horses at three farms in Jordan. The presence of EEV antibodies was detected by a serum neutralization assay. Seroprevalence of EEV was 58.2% (184/316 horses) in Israel, 48.5% (32/66 horses) in Palestine and 2% (2/100 horses) in Jordan. Seroprevalence in Jordan was significantly lower than in Israel and Palestine (P &lt; 0.001). The farm (P &lt; 0.001) and horse age (P = 0.003) were found as significant risk factors for EEV exposure in Israel in multivariable statistical analysis. The results of this study further demonstrate that EEV is no longer limited to South Africa and is endemic in both Israel and Palestine and horses in Jordan were also exposed to this virus emphasizing the potential of pathogens to invade new ecological niches.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Ticks belonging to the family Ixodidae can act as vectors, reservoirs or amplifiers of SFG rickettsiae. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SFG rickettsioses in cattle, sheep and goats from Khartoum State, Sudan. Blood samples were collected from a total of 600 animals (sheep, goats and cattle) from 32 different farms distributed in three locations in Khartoum State during the period January to December 2012. Sera were tested for antibodies against SFG rickettsiae using IFAT. The prevalence of seropositivity was 59.3% in sheep, 60.1% in goats and 64.4% in cattle. Season was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae in cattle during winter. The SFG rickettsiae antibodies prevalence was significantly higher in female compared with male in sheep, but there were no significant differences between male and female in either cattle or goats. The prevalence was significantly higher in adult animals compared with young in both sheep and goats. With regard to management system, there was a significant difference in the prevalence in cattle raised in closed system compared with those raised in semi-intensive system. In contrast, there was significant difference in the seroprevalence of SFG in sheep where the prevalence was higher in the sheep raised in semi-intensive system compared with those raised in close system. There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence in goats with regard to management systems. The unexpected high prevalence of SFG rickettsia antibodies in domestic ruminants sera suggest that the veterinary and public health impact of these agents in Sudan need further evaluation especially in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Sildenafil (SF) is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) V inhibitor that causes pulmonary artery (PA) vasodilation by increasing pulmonary vascular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate which subsequently increases the activity of endogenous nitric oxide. Pimobendan (PB) is a PDE III inhibitor with calcium sensitizing effects thereby exerting positive inotropy and vasodilation. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term survival of dogs with severe PH treated with SF and PB compared to SF alone. The use of PB in combination with SF did not result in a statistically significant increase in survival times in dogs with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic respiratory disease compared to SF alone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) methods have been developed and published, and are currently being used in many countries across Europe for BTV detection and typing. In France, the national reference laboratory (NRL) for orbiviruses develops and validates 'ready-to-use' kits with private companies for viral RNA detection. The regional laboratories network that was set up to deal with a heavy demand for analyses has used these available kits. From 2007, ring tests were organized to monitor the performance of the French laboratories. This study presents the results of 63 regional laboratories in the ring trial organized in 2016. Blood samples were sent to the laboratories. Participants were asked to use the rtRT-PCR methods in place in their laboratory, for detection of all BTV serotypes and specifically BTV-8. The French regional laboratories are able to detect and genotype BTV in affected animals. Despite the use of several methods (i.e. RNA extraction and different commercial rtRT-PCRs), the network is homogeneous. The ring trial demonstrated that the French regional veterinary laboratories have reliable and robust BTV diagnostic tools for BTV genome detection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The birds appeared unconscious and their feathers were soaking wet, and with a body rigid and cold to touch. The aim of the study was to resuscitate the hypothermic pullets. Blood samples were obtained and core body temperature recorded before and after rewarming. The birds were resuscitated using active external rewarming technique. Blood samples revealed significant (P &lt; 0.05) decreases in the concentrations of serum electrolytes of Na, Cl, K, Ca and P; and renal function and activities of the serum enzymes of AST, ALT, ALP and CRT decreased compared to baseline reference normal values. Colonic temperature, recorded through the cloacae, revealed a temperature of 29 &#177; 0.4&#176;C. The presumptive diagnosis was severe hypothermia. Treatment of the pullets using active external rewarming technique for 7 to 10 h resulted in successful restoration of all the behavioural, biochemical and colonic temperature responses to normal values. The treatment resulted in a complete recovery of all the birds with no signs of illness at 4-week follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first reports to evaluate the behavioural and biochemical responses of pullets accidentally exposed to severe hypothermia, and successful treatment of the birds using active external rewarming technique.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirteen abattoirs were visited during 2 years and bruises were identified, classified, and quantified by zone and degree (depth and size). One hundred carcasses were separated and bruises were cut out and weighed separately. From a total of 15 157 carcasses observed, 60.0% had at least one bruise; 42.0% of these had bruises on both sides. The expensive butt zone was the most damaged, followed by rib, shoulder and loin, respectively. The mean weight and standard error of the condemned trimmed meat was 1602 &#177; 212 g. It suppose a loss of 899 g per animal slaugtered in Uruguay. In a country sending 2.5 million heads of cattle to be slaughter yearly, this indicates an important financial loss. Improving transport conditions and personnel skills will probably result in a better welfare for the animals as well as better financial profit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Treatment with immunosuppressive medication has been widely reported, however no prospective clinical trials with a standard glucocorticoid monotherapy are available. The objectives were to compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis at diagnosis and after treatment with a standard glucocorticoid (GC) dose and to determine the survival time in dogs with MUE. We hypothesized that abnormal CSF findings would normalize in dogs with MUE, and survival time would be longer than previously reported for glucocortocoid therapy alone. Inclusion criteria were: (1) normal minimum database, (2) no GC use within 5 days, (3) magnetic resonance imaging performed, (4) negative infectious disease titres, and (5) abnormal CSF analysis. All dogs received GC therapy at 1 mg/kg per os q 12 h. Responders had normal CSF analysis at 1 month. Sixteen dogs met the inclusion criteria. Median total nucleated cell count (TNCC) and protein concentration at time of diagnosis were 39 cells/&#956;L (0-1400 cells/&#956;L), and 49 mg/dL (25-293 mg/dL), respectively. Median TNCC and protein concentration at 1 month were 1 cell/&#956;L (0-120 cells/&#956;L), and 24 mg/dL (13-175 mg/dL), respectively. Seven of 16 dogs (44%) were responders. There was no significant difference in survival between the CSF responders and CSF non-responders (P = 0.85). Overall median survival was 602 days (45-654 days). This study supports using GC therapy in dogs with MUE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) a condition where porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection is necessary - though not sufficient - to trigger disease, has become one of the major health problems to the porcine productive chain. Despite the high expected prevalence of both PCMV and PCV2 in swine-raising farms, no links between PCMV and PMWS have been investigated so far. In view of that, the present study was conducted to search for relations between PCMV infections and the occurrence of PMWS. Spleen and sera of PMWS-affected and non-PWMS-affected animals were examined. In PMWS-affected animals, PCMV DNA was detected in 88.4% of the spleen samples and 7.6% of the sera, whereas in non-PMWS-affected pigs, PCMV DNA was detected in 72.7% of the spleens and 10% of sera. Such differences were not statistically significant. These findings showed despite the high prevalence of PCMV infections in the swine population examined, no positive or negative association could be inferred from the presence of PCMV DNA and the occurrence of PMWS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dietary fibre has been recommended to stimulate hair faecal excretion. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of psyllium and different levels of total dietary fibre (6% vs. 11% vs. 15% TdF) on hair faecal excretion in short and long-haired (LH) domestic cats. Twenty-one adult cats were divided into three panels: shedding panel, short-haired (SH) panel and LH panel. Shedding panel was used to assess shedding throughout the study with a normalized brushing. In parallel, SH panel and LH panel were used to evaluate the impact of the diets on faecal hair excretion. They were fed a low-fibre diet during phase 1 (diet 6, 6.0% TdF). In phase 2, panels were fed either diet 11 (11% TdF) or diet 15 (15% TdF). In phase 3, cats returned to diet 6 before a crossover on the other diet in phase 4. Those diets were fed to cats for 14 days. Faecal hair excretion was quantified daily. Data were analysed using a generalized linear model procedure. The assessment of shedding showed that the study did not occur during moulting season. In the LH panel, diet 11 and diet 15 increased (P &lt; 0.001) faecal hair excretion by 81% and 113% respectively, compared to the control diet. In the SH panel, no influence of the diets was observed. This study supports that fibre affects faecal hair excretion in LH cats, suggesting that a diet with psyllium and 11% or 15% TdF might minimize hairball formation in 14 days and between shedding periods. In SH cats, 11% and 15% fibre levels had no effect on faecal hair excretion. This could be explained by the low quantity of hair ingested outside the shedding season or by the short duration of the study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical suitability of a perineural coiled catheter (PCC) at the sciatic nerve and to evaluate pain during the early post-operative period in dogs after tibial plateau levelling osteotomy. Pre-operatively, a combined block of the sciatic and the femoral nerves was performed under sonographic guidance (ropivacaine 0.5%; 0.3 mL kg[-1] per nerve). Thereafter, a PCC was placed near the sciatic nerve. Carprofen (4 mg kg[-1] intravenously) was administered at the end of anaesthesia. After surgery, all dogs were randomly assigned to receive four injections of ropivacaine (group R; 0.25%, 0.3 mL kg[-1]) or NaCl 0.9% (group C; 0.3 mL kg[-1]) every 6 h through the PCC. Pain was assessed by use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a multi-dimensional pain score (4Avet) before surgery (T-1), for 390 min (T0, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 and T390) as well as 1 day after surgery (Day 1). Methadone (0.1 mg kg[-1]) was administered each time the VAS was &#8805;40 mm or the 4Avet was &#8805;5. At T390 dogs received buprenorphine (0.02 mg kg[-1]). Data were compared using Mann-Whitney rank sum tests and repeated measures analysis of variance. Regardless of group allocation, 55% of dogs required methadone. VAS was significantly lower at T390 (P = 0.003), and at Day 1 (P = 0.002) and so was 4Avet at Day 1 (P = 0.012) in group R than in group C. Bleeding occurred in one dog at PCC placement and PCC dislodged six times of 47 PCCs placed. Minor complications occurred with PCC but allowed four repeated administrations of ropivacaine or saline over 24 h in 91.5% of the cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Treatment-associated toxicity, response to rescue chemotherapy and prognostic factors are largely unknown. This retrospective study was performed to identify treatment-associated toxicity, response to rescue chemotherapy and treatment outcome for cats diagnosed with small cell lymphoma of various anatomic locations. Medical records from 56 cats were evaluated. All cats were treated with glucocorticoid and chlorambucil with discontinuation of treatment recommended at 1 year if complete clinical response was documented. Chemotherapy toxicity was uncommon (33.9%) and generally mild. Grade III or IV hepatotoxicity was documented in 10.7% of patients. Overall response rate was 85.7% with glucocorticoid and chlorambucil. Median progression-free survival was 1078 days. Overall response rate for rescue chemotherapy was 59%. Reintroduction of prednisone and chlorambucil was associated with significantly longer survival than prednisone and lomustine (&gt;1500 vs. 492 days, P = 0.01). Median overall survival times for cats with lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract was not significantly different from those with extra-intestinal disease locations (1148 vs. 1375 days, P = 0.23). Median overall survival was 1317 days. Toxicity, other than hepatotoxicity was mild. Rescue chemotherapy with re-introduction of glucocorticoids and chlorambucil was most successful. Discontinuation of glucocorticoid and chlorambucil with subsequent reintroduction as rescue chemotherapy appears to be just as effective as continued administration in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The drug was administered at the dose rate of 7.5 mg kg[-1] body weight through the intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) route followed by plasma collection and analysis at different time intervals. After analysis, using High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Ultraviolet, various pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using visual fit for compartmental analysis, followed by integration with pharmacodynamic parameters against Escherichia coli and Pasteurella multocida. Although total area under plasma drug concentration time curve was higher through the i.v. route, mean residence time and metabolic conversion ratio was higher following administration by the i.m. route indicating longer persistence of the drug in body. Overall i.m. bioavailability of the parent compound with its metabolite was found to be 91%. Upon, Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic integration, all the parameters indicated significant antibacterial activity. It can be concluded that the dose of enrofloxacin used in the present study can be administered to contain infections caused by P. multocida and E. coli in buffalo calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067176</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Grapiprant: an EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist and novel therapy for pain and inflammation.</Title>	<Abstract>There are five active prostanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) that have widespread and varied physiologic functions throughout the body, including regulation of gastrointestinal mucosal blood flow, renal haemodynamics and primary haemostasis. Each prostanoid has at least one distinct receptor that mediates its action. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) is a prostanoid that serves important homeostatic functions, yet is also responsible for regulating pain and inflammation. PGE 2 binds to four receptors, of which one, the EP4 receptor, is primarily responsible for the pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (OA). The deleterious and pathologic actions of PGE 2 are inhibited in varying degrees by steroids, aspirin and cyclo-oxygenase inhibiting NSAIDs; however, administration of these drugs causes decreased production of PGE 2, thereby decreasing or eliminating the homeostatic functions of the molecule. By inhibiting just the EP4 receptor, the homeostatic function of PGE 2 is better maintained. This manuscript will introduce a new class of pharmaceuticals known as the piprant class. Piprants are prostaglandin receptor antagonists (PRA). This article will include basic physiology of AA, prostanoids and piprants, will review available evidence for the relevance of EP4 PRAs in rodent models of pain and inflammation, and will reference available data for an EP4 PRA in dogs and cats. Piprants are currently in development for veterinary patients and the purpose of this manuscript is to introduce veterinarians to the class of drugs, with emphasis on an EP4 PRA and its potential role in the control of pain and inflammation associated with OA in dogs and cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It is transmitted by biting midges, first and foremost Culicoides spp., and causes congenital malformations reflected in arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly (AH) syndrome. The aim of this study was to collect data on the emergence of SBV as a new arthropod-borne disease introduced into Europe in 2011. Germany was located in the core region of the 2011/2012 epidemic. Following two seroprevalence studies in the north-west of Germany in 2012, this study focused on the epidemiology and distribution of SBV throughout 130 small ruminant flocks in the whole country. Blood samples were obtained of 30 animals per flock and a SBV-specific questionnaire was used to collect operating data of the farms. The median within-herd seroprevalence for all 130 flocks tested was 53.3% with a total range from 0% to 100%. The median within-herd seroprevalence for goats was 30% [interquartile range (IQR): 40.3%] and 57% for sheep (IQR: 43.3%). Small ruminant flocks kept permanently indoors or housed overnight had a significantly lower seroprevalence than flocks kept permanently outdoors. In addition, this study revealed a significantly lower seroprevalence in the north-east of Germany. These results show that small ruminants in Germany are still at risk of contracting new SBV infections following incomplete seroconversion of flocks especially in the north-east of Germany. This might contribute to SBV becoming enzootic in central and northern Europe. Furthermore, the survey revealed that housing animals at least during mating and early pregnancy may reduce the risk of new SBV infections and may thus be an option to reduce losses as long as there is no licensed vaccine available on the German market.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The specific objective of this paper was to assess the practices, capacities and incentives of actors involved in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) control to provide information for prevention and control in Ghana. Questionnaires were designed based on specific practices, incentives and capacities associated with each mitigation measure that was being assessed. Two peacetime preventive mitigation measures (biosecurity and reporting) and two outbreak containment measures (culling with compensation and movement control) were selected for evaluation. Supply chain actors were characterised based on baseline information. Tables were generated showing proportions of respondents in the various response categories in Likert-scale type itemised questionnaire. Mean scores (and their standard deviations) for the various actors with regard to mitigation measures were calculated. Pair-wise comparisons were done using t-ratio statistic and significance of differences were determined at a Bonferroni adjusted P-value of 0.0024. The study found statistically significant differences between certain actors for practices (biosecurity, reporting, culling and compensation and movement controls), incentives (reporting and movement control) and capacities (reporting and movement control). The findings provide lessons to help improve education and messages on HPAI and to help provide technical assistance targeted at specific actors to prevent and control future HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Ghana.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Commercial multispecies nucleoprotein (NP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been replacing the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test as pre-screening tools. Few comparative studies have been conducted to test sera from domestic ducks for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation between commercial NP ELISAs and the HI test. Anti-NP and anti-haemagglutinin (HA) antibodies were measured in sera from domestic ducks that had undergone serological screening and from juvenile domestic Pekin ducks that were experimentally infected with LPAI viruses. The findings highlight an absence of a correlation between NP ELISA and HI results with both field and experimental duck sera. Dissimilar kinetics of the antibodies detected during the follow-up evaluation of the humoral immune responses in experimentally infected ducks may explain this lack of correlation. Indeed, anti-NP titres decreased over time, whereas anti-HA titres remained unchanged after inoculation with the H3N1 LPAI virus isolated from domestic duck or the H7N1 LPAI virus isolated from chicken. Despite these differences, the NP ELISA may serve as a valid pre-screening tool to detect circulating LPAI viruses in domestic duck populations at the flock level.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Its safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in human clinical studies, but have only rarely been discussed in the veterinary literature. This prospective observational study was performed to evaluate changes during a 24 h period in serum biochemistries associated with administration of lactated Ringer's solution subcutaneously to healthy cats. Lactated Ringer's solution was administered subcutaneously once to ten healthy, euvolemic cats at a dose of 22 mL kg[-1]. Blood biochemistry analytes were sampled at baseline and at serial time points for a total of 24 h. Changes in biochemical analytes at each time point were compared to baseline and evaluated for statistical significance. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly less than baseline at 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-infusion. Serum creatinine was significantly less than baseline at 2, 4 and 6 h. Packed cell volume (PCV) was significantly less than baseline at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Total plasma proteins were significantly less than baseline at all time points. Serum electrolytes did not change from baseline at any time point. Urine specific gravity was significantly increased from baseline only at 6 h post-Lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) administration. Subcutaneous administration of lactated Ringer's solution appears to result in haemodilution with minimal change to serum electrolyte concentrations in clinically normal, euvolemic cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067181</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Differing perceptions - Swedish farmers' views of infectious disease control.</Title>	<Abstract>Although farm biosecurity reduces the risk of disease spread among livestock, this knowledge is not always applied. Farmers' application of disease preventive measures is expected to depend on many things, e.g. whether they consider disease prevention possible and demographic factors. In this study, Swedish livestock farmers' perspectives on occurrence, control and communication related to infectious livestock diseases were investigated. A questionnaire study was performed in 2012-2013, and included responses from almost 2000 livestock farmers with cattle, pigs, sheep or goats. Associations between responses and factors related to herd type and demography were investigated using multivariable regression models. Results showed a strong general agreement among farmers that disease prevention is important. However, results also showed differing opinions among farmers. For example, female farmers indicated higher levels of perceived knowledge of disease spread and a stronger belief that they can prevent disease introduction. Results indicate that farmers who believe they have the necessary knowledge, have stronger sense of control and also demand that others take responsibility to prevent spread. Furthermore, dairy farmers were more likely to respond that repeated exposure to infections could be beneficial for animal health. The number of perceived disease outbreaks was also higher among these farmers. Regarding government issued compensation to farmers in case of outbreaks, a wide range of opinions were recorded. Responses confirm that the farm veterinarian is an important source of disease information and several different communication channels are needed to reach farmers. In conclusion, our results show that factors such as gender, education level and age influence how prevention and occurrence of disease outbreaks are perceived and best communicated. We suggest that efforts are made to increase knowledge about disease prevention among farmers and veterinary practitioners and that farm veterinarians should be encouraged to motivate farmers to strengthen farm biosecurity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067182</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Understanding the canine intestinal microbiota and its modification by pro-, pre- and synbiotics - what is the evidence?</Title>	<Abstract>Interest in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and possibilities of its therapeutic modifications has soared over the last decade and more detailed knowledge specific to the canine microbiota at different mucosal sites including the gut is available. Probiotics, prebiotics or their combination (synbiotics) are a way of modifying the intestinal microbiota and exert effects on the host immune response. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways, for example production of antimicrobial peptides, enhancing growth of favourable endogenous microorganisms, competition for epithelial colonisation sites and immune-modulatory functions. Despite widespread use of pro-, pre- and synbiotics, scientific evidence of their beneficial effects in different conditions of the dog is scarce. Specific effects of different strains, their combination or their potential side-effects have not been evaluated sufficiently. In some instances, in vitro results have been promising, but could not be transferred consistently into in vivo situations. Specific canine gastrointestinal (GI) diseases or conditions where probiotics would be beneficial, their most appropriate dosage and application have not been assessed extensively. This review summarises the current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome composition in the dog and evaluates the evidence for probiotic use in canine GI diseases to date. It wishes to provide veterinarians with evidence-based information on when and why these products could be useful in preventing or treating canine GI conditions. It also outlines knowledge about safety and approval of commercial probiotic products, and the potential use of faecal microbial transplantation, as they are related to the topic of probiotic usage.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067183</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Atopic dermatitis and the intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The prevalence of human and canine allergic diseases is commonly perceived to be increasing. Suggested predisposing factors in people and dogs include increased allergen load, increased exposure to pollutants, reduced family size, reduced microbial load and less exposure to infection at a young age, increasingly urbanised environment, and changes in dietary habits. Genetic make-up may provide a template for phenotypic predisposition which is strongly influenced by our diet and environment leading to constant regulation of gene expression. One way in which diet can alter gene expression is via its effects on the gut flora or microbiota, the collection of microbes residing in the gastrointestinal tract. The resident microbiota is important in maintaining structural and functional integrity of the gut and in immune system regulation. It is an important driver of host immunity, helps protect against invading enteropathogens, and provides nutritional benefits to the host. Disruption of the microbiota (dysbiosis) may lead to severe health problems, both in the gastrointestinal tract and extra-intestinal organ systems. The precise mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota exerts its effects are only beginning to be unravelled but research is demonstrating close links between gut microflora and many factors involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). AD and indeed any other 'skin disease', may be seen as a possible manifestation of a more systemic problem involving gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, which may occur even in the absence of gastrointestinal signs. Manipulation of the canine intestinal microbiota as a method for modifying atopy, may be attempted in many ways including avoidance of certain foods, supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics, optimising nutrient intake, minimising stress, antimicrobial therapy, correction and prevention of low stomach acid, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Milk has traditionally been a popular food to give to dogs in this country. There is a recent perceived increase in the number of owners choosing commercial diets for their pets. This study aimed to determine how dog owners visiting a single veterinary practice in Colombo fed their pets. We hoped that this would help achieve a general understanding of pet feeding practices in Sri Lanka and gain some basic demographic information on the owned dog population. The study was conducted via questionnaires distributed to pet owners visiting a first opinion and referral practice in Colombo. Hundred questionnaires were collected and analysed, 69% of study dogs were neutered, 42% of dogs were fed only home-cooked food, while 18% were fed only commercial food. About 40% of dogs were fed a mixture of commercial and home-cooked food, 49% of dogs were fed milk as a separate meal in addition to their normal diet and 57% of dogs received dietary supplements. Dogs consuming commercial food for more than half their intake were no less likely (P = 0.75) to receive dietary supplements than dogs fed homemade food for more than half their diet. This study provides some basic information regarding the feeding practices and demographics of the owned dog population in one Sri Lankan city, Colombo, highlighting some areas of concern.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thirty-six cats with CKD were randomly assigned to receive either daily vitamin E or a placebo for 3 months in a double-blinded study design. History and physical examination, blood pressure, complete blood count (CBC), PCV, biochemical profile and urinalysis (UA) were determined. Parameters of oxidative stress and osmotic fragility were measured. Cats were administered vitamin E or placebo once daily for 3 months. Cats were then reassessed and the diagnostics were repeated. Twenty-four cats completed the study, 11 in the vitamin E group and 13 in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between the two groups at the start, or upon completion of the study with regard to biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, erythrocyte osmotic fragility or PCV. None of these parameters changed significantly in either group over the treatment period. Daily supplementation with 30 IU of vitamin E did not affect the measures of oxidative stress or the anaemia seen in cats with CKD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there is only a small number of cases documenting its use in dogs with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology (MUE). We hypothesized that the use of MMF and corticosteroids in dogs with MUE results in comparable survival data to other published treatment protocols and is associated with limited adverse effects. A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs clinically diagnosed with MUE recorded signalment, neuroanatomic localization, magnetic resonance imaging findings, cerebrospinal fluid analysis results, medications administered, follow-up neurologic examinations, survival and adverse events. Variables were compared between dogs which were treated with MMF within 30 days of diagnosis (immediate group) vs. dogs in which MMF therapy was started &gt;30 days after diagnosis (delayed group). Twenty-five cases of MUE were identified. The overall median survival time from diagnosis was 731 days (range 43-1672 days). After 1 month of MMF treatment, 92% of dogs showed improvement on a neurological examination. There was no significant effect of any recorded parameter on survival, including delayed vs. immediate initiation of MMF treatment. Dogs with delayed treatment had significantly lower clinical remission rates than dogs with immediate treatment at 6 months after starting MMF. Adverse events were identified in two cases (8%) and were characterized by mild gastrointestinal signs (vomiting and decreased appetite). Administration of MMF appears safe in dogs with MUE. The use of MMF results in comparable survival times to alternate immunosuppressive protocols.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067187</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Phylogenetic analysis of Dermatophilus congolensis isolated from naturally infected cattle in Abeokuta and Ilorin, Nigeria.</Title>	<Abstract>Dermatophilus congolensis, the aetiological agent of dermatophilosis, is a pleomorphic, Gram-positive actinomycete, which infects animals and humans. Often, there is a wrong diagnosis of the infection in animals because of the close resemblance of the organism with other members of the family Actinomycetaceae. In this study, molecular tools were applied to suspected isolates of D. congolensis obtained from naturally infected cattle in Nigeria for confirmation of dermatophilosis. DNA extraction from 54 suspected pure colonies of D. congolensis was carried out using the QIAamp[&#174;] DNA Mini extraction kit. PCR targeted at the 16S rRNA gene was employed for the confirmation of D. congolensis using 5'-ACATGCAAGTCGAACGATGA-3' and 5'-ACGCTCGCACCCTACGTATT-3' as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Positive amplicons were then sequenced directly using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit with the forward primers and AmpliTaq-FS DNA Polymerase. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using bioedit (Ibis Biosciences Carlsbad, CA USA) and the phylogenetic analysis was carried out using mega 5.2 (Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, The Biodesign Institute, Tempe, Arizona, USA) software programme. The aligned nucleotide sequences of 10 positive D. congolensis isolates had between 94% to 99% homology with the sequences of D. congolensis satellite DNA in GenBank. This result also revealed that the sequenced D. congolensis are of different strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that D. congolensis, though closely related to Nocardia brasiliensis (NR 074743.01) and Streptomyces sp. (JN 400114.1), belongs to different genus. In conclusion, molecular tools employed in the study were able to confirm the identity of the test organisms as D. congolensis. It can also be concluded that two strains of D. congolensis obtained from the study can still be accommodated within the previously listed strains available in GenBank while the remaining eight may be different strains of D. congolensis not yet listed in GenBank.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The study involved seven client-owned dogs with histologically or cytologically confirmed neoplasia that were treated with CSR intramuscularly. Platinum levels were measured at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Complete blood cell (CBC) counts, body weight, local toxicity and side effects were also evaluated at the time of platinum measurement at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. CSR released carboplatin steadily over 30 days. Neutropenia was noted as Grade 3 in one dog (14%) and Grade 4 in two dogs (29%) at day 14, and Grade 4 in one dog (14%) at day 21. Thrombocytopenia was noted as Grade 2 in four dogs (57%), Grade 3 in one dog (14%) and Grade 4 in one dog (14%) at day 14; Grade 2 in two dogs (29%) and Grade 3 in one dog (14%) at days 21 and 28. Grade 1 lethargy in one dog (14%) and Grade 1 nausea in dog (14%) occurring within 7 days after administration. No obvious local injection site reactions were noted. CSR administered at 350 mg m[-2] intramuscularly resulted in a steady release over 30 days. Myelosuppression (Grade 4) was noted in 86% of patients. CSR released the drug slowly and steadily, however additional studies are needed to assess acceptable dosage requirements.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Consumption of unpasteurized milk is a risk factor of human toxoplasmosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of T. gondii in goats' milk in Northwest of Tunisia (Jendouba Governorate). A total number of 77 blood samples were collected from six herds were screened with a commercial ELISA kit for T. gondii antibodies. For the same goats' samples, a nested PCR was performed to detect T. gondii DNA in milk. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 31.2% (&#177;0.05) while the molecular prevalence of this parasite in milk was estimated to 7.8% (&#177;0.03). A very low value of kappa showed that there is not agreement between seroprevalence and parasite prevalence in milk. These results suggest that the consumption of raw milk from naturally infected goats is a potential source of human infection. An extension programme should be implemented to decrease related to goats' raw milk consumption.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We conducted a study to explore people's awareness about rabies, their attitudes towards dogs and practices associated with treating dog bites in Satkhira Sadar, a south-western sub-district of Bangladesh. Of the total 3200 households (HHs) surveyed, the majority of the respondents have heard about rabies (73%) and there was a high level of awareness that dog bite is the main cause of rabies (86%), and that rabies can be prevented by vaccination (85%). However, 59% of the dog bite victims first seek treatment from traditional healers instead of visiting the hospitals, 29% received the rabies vaccine, 2% practiced proper wound washing with soap and water, while 4.8% have not taken any measures. None of the victims have received rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). Of the respondents, 5.2% reported a history of dog bite in at least one family member, and 11.8% reported a history of dog bite in domestic animals during the previous year. The HHs having a higher number of family members (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07-1.2), having a pet dog (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.2) and caring or feeding a community dog (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-2.9) showed an increased risk of getting a dog bite. Among the bite victims, 3.6% (n = 6) humans and 15.8% (n = 60) animals died. As a measure for dog population management (DPM), 56% preferred sterilization while the rest preferred killing of dogs. The current treatment seeking behaviours of the respondents should be improved through additional education and awareness programme and better availability for the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis in Bangladesh. We recommend scaling up national mass dog vaccination and DPM to reduce the burden of rabies cases and dog bites in Bangladesh.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total of 238 M. bovis-negative calves were challenged on three consecutive days with M. bovis by endobronchial deposition. Post-challenge, a total of 126 animals fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomly allocated to three treatment groups: tulathromycin, tildipirosin and saline. Clinical observations for signs of respiratory disease and injection site assessments were conducted daily for 14 days post-treatment. The animals were then killed, the lungs were examined for evidence of lesions, and samples collected for bacterial isolation. Calves treated with tulathromycin had a lower percentage of lung with lesions (P = 0.0079), lower mortality (P = 0.0477), fewer days with depressed demeanour (P = 0.0486) and higher body weight (P = 0.0112) than calves administered tildipirosin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Efficacy was assessed as a secondary measure. The first dose of SalpIL2 was administered to 19 dogs on Day 0; amputation was done after 10 days with chemotherapy following 2 weeks later. SalpIL2 was administered concurrent with chemotherapy, for a total of five doses of doxorubicin and six doses of SalpIL2. There were six reportable events prior to chemotherapy, but none appeared due to SalpIL2. Dogs receiving SalpIL2 had significantly longer disease-free interval (DFI) than a comparison group of dogs treated with doxorubicin alone. Dogs treated using lower doses of SalpIL2 also had longer DFI than dogs treated using the highest SalpIL2 dose. The data indicate that SalpIL2 is safe and well tolerated, which supports additional testing to establish the potential for SalpIL2 as a novel form of adjuvant therapy for dogs with osteosarcoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The debilitating joint disorders of hip dysplasia, cranial cruciate ligament tear (CCL) and elbow dysplasia can shorten a dog's useful working life and impact its role as a family member. For this study, veterinary hospital records were examined over a 14.5-year period on 1170 intact and neutered (including spaying) German Shepherd Dogs for joint disorders and cancers previously associated with neutering. The diseases were followed through 8 years of age, with the exception of mammary cancer (MC) in females that was followed through 11 years. The cancers followed, apart from mammary, were osteosarcoma, lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma and mast cell tumour. In intact males, 7% were diagnosed with one or more joint disorders, while in males neutered prior to a year of age, a significantly higher 21% were diagnosed with one or more joint disorders. In intact females, 5% were diagnosed with one or more joint disorders, while in females neutered prior to a year of age, this measure was significantly increased to 16%. The increased joint disorder incidence mostly associated with early neutering was CCL. MC was diagnosed in 4% of intact females compared with less than 1% in females neutered before 1 year. The occurrence of the other cancers followed through 8 years of age was not higher in the neutered than in the intact dogs. Urinary incontinence, not diagnosed in intact females, was diagnosed in 7% of females neutered before 1 year, a significant difference. These findings, profiling the increase in joint disorders associated with early neutering, should help guide the timing of neutering for this breed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For bone marrow aspiration as well as for MSC cultivation, there is a need to optimize techniques and protocols to enhance MSC harvest at minimized culture times. In a comparative study bone marrow aspirates from sternebra 4 and 5 were collected at two different positions within the sternebrae, either from 10 mm or from 30 mm dorsal from the ventral margin of the sternebrae. Accuracy of the puncture depth was confirmed by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Isolated MSCs were cultivated using media supplemented with three alternative sera, i.e. fetal calf serum, standardized horse serum and autologous serum. Due to morphological characteristics (spherical shape, only thin layer of hyaline cartilage at the ventral site, reliable bone marrow aspiration from only 10 mm intraosseous depth), sternebra 5 appeared most suitable for bone marrow aspiration. Cultivation and expansion of BM-MSCs was most efficient using fetal calf serum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The potential of rabbits and hares to serve as competent reservoirs for the disease has recently been demonstrated, although assessment of the importance of their role on disease dynamics is hampered by the absence of quantitative knowledge on the accuracy of diagnostic techniques in these species. A Bayesian latent-class model was used here to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the Immuno-fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) in serum and a Leishmania-nested PCR (Ln-PCR) in skin for samples collected from 217 rabbits and 70 hares from two different populations in the region of Madrid, Spain. A two-population model, assuming conditional independence between test results and incorporating prior information on the performance of the tests in other animal species obtained from the literature, was used. Two alternative cut-off values were assumed for the interpretation of the IFAT results: 1/50 for conservative and 1/25 for sensitive interpretation. Results suggest that sensitivity and specificity of the IFAT were around 70-80%, whereas the Ln-PCR was highly specific (96%) but had a limited sensitivity (28.9% applying the conservative interpretation and 21.3% with the sensitive one). Prevalence was higher in the rabbit population (50.5% and 72.6%, for the conservative and sensitive interpretation, respectively) than in hares (6.7% and 13.2%). Our results demonstrate that the IFAT may be a useful screening tool for diagnosis of leishmaniasis in rabbits and hares. These results will help to design and implement surveillance programmes in wild species, with the ultimate objective of early detecting and preventing incursions of the disease into domestic and human populations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Four dholes, two Indian grey wolves and four Indian jackals were immobilised using ketamine-xylazine combination for either medical or management interventions. Based on the estimated body weight, canids were darted upon with 6-8 mg kg[-1] ketamine and 0.7-1.14 mg kg[-1] xylazine. Initial signs of drug effect included decreased mentation and progressive ataxia followed by recumbency. The mean &#177; SD of induction time was 14.25 &#177; 2.75 (range: 11-17 min), 11 &#177; 3.16 (range: 8-15 min) and 15.5 &#177; 3.54 (range: 13-18 min) in dhole, Indian jackal and Indian wolf, respectively. Hyperthermia was initially observed in all the jackals and dholes, whereas rectal temperature in wolves remained well within the normal range for canids. The mean duration of anaesthesia was 31 &#177; 8.83 (range: 23-43 min), 32.5 &#177; 5.32 (range: 26-39 min) and 30.5 &#177; 7.78 (range: 25-36 min) in dhole, Indian jackal and Indian wolf, respectively, with subsequent smooth and uneventful recovery in all the cases. The observations made during immobilisation procedures in this work suggest that chemical immobilisation of captive dhole, Indian wolf and Indian jackal with 6-8 mg kg[-1] ketamine and 1 mg kg[-1] xylazine is effective and safe for routine management and medical interventions in these species provided body temperature is closely monitored and corrected as appropriate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, local anaesthetics currently available have a relatively short duration of action. Although there are several tools available to treat perioperative pain in companion animals, overall, there is an unmet need for products that can be administered in the clinic, and provide pain relief for the crucial first few days following surgery in the home environment. Specifically, in relation to local anaesthetics, there is a clear unmet need for a long-acting local anaesthetic that can be added to the multimodal analgesic protocol to provide pain relief to patients in the home environment or during extended hospitalization. Bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension recently became available for use in humans, and has proven efficacious and safe. This paper will review the use of local anaesthetics, particularly bupivacaine, in dogs and cats, and introduce a new formulation of prolonged release bupivacaine that is in development for dogs and cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Birds of prey are considered indicators of the presence of AMR bacteria in their ecosystem because of their predatory behaviour. Only few data are reported in the literature on AMR strains isolated from animals housed in zoos and none about AMR in raptors housed in zoological gardens. This study investigated the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the isolates obtained from the conjunctival and cloacal bacterial flora of 14 healthy birds of prey, 6 Accipitriformes, 3 Falconiformes and 5 Strigiformes, housed in an Italian zoological garden. Staphylococcus spp. was isolated from 50% of the conjunctival swabs, with S. xylosus as the most common species. From cloacal swabs, Escherichia coli was cultured from all animals, while Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. were isolated from a smaller number of birds. Worthy of note is the isolation of Escherichia fergusonii and Serratia odorifera, rarely isolated from raptors. Staphylococci were also isolated. All the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). To the author's knowledge, this is the first report regarding the presence of MDR strains within raptors housed in a zoological garden. Since resistance genes can be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria, this represents a potential hazard for the emergence of new MDR pathogens. In conclusion, the obtained data could be useful for ex-situ conservation programmes aimed to preserve the health of the endangered species housed in a zoo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Data on putative risk factors were collect and analysed for their significance of association with these pathogens. Salmonella spp. were detected at higher proportions in sheep faeces and sheep carcasses in comparison to cattle faeces (odds ratio = 2.4 and 2.2, respectively). This pathogen was less common in milk or carcasses samples from cattle or chickens. Sheep and camel carcass samples were highly contaminated with Salmonella spp. Faecal samples from cattle had the most diverse serovars of Salmonella enterica including S. Newport, S. Haifa, S. Kedougou, S. Kentucky, S. Mbandaka and S. Goettingen. Exotic serovars in sheep included S. Eastbourne, S. Chester and S. Kottnus. Serovars that were shed in camel faeces included S. Newport, S. Bovismorbificans and S. Infantis. In all sampled populations, detection of Salmonella spp. was more likely during warmer months than cold months. Listeria monocytogenes was not common in the targeted populations and was detected at a rate of 2.4%, mainly from sheep carcasses. The study highlights the role of food animals as reservoirs of pathogens across boundaries since all feed are imported in that population from different parts of the world.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The prevalence of uroliths reported on imaging findings has not been published. The objective of this retrospective study was to use imaging data to investigate the anatomical location and the prevalence of macroscopic in situ uroliths in cats. Radiographs, sonograms and imaging reports from two cohorts of cats (from New Zealand (n = 497) and the United States (n = 693)) from 2004-2013 were reviewed for the presence of in situ uroliths. Uroliths were categorized by their location in the lower or upper urinary tract. Radiographic studies were performed on 43% (212/497) of the cats from New Zealand and 50% (349/693) of the cats from the USA. Sonographic studies were performed on 57% (285/497) of the cats from New Zealand and 50% (344/693) of the cats from the USA. The total prevalence of uroliths was 3% in the New Zealand cohort and 13% in the USA cohort. Lower tract urolith prevalence in the New Zealand cohort was 2.4% (5/212) in cats &#8804; 6y and 1.1% (3/285) in cats &gt;6y. Upper tract urolith prevalence in the New Zealand cohort was 0.5% (1/212) in cats &#8804; 6y and 1.8% (5/285) in cats &gt;6y. Lower tract urolith prevalence in the United States cohort was 6.0% (11/183) in cats &#8804; 6y and 2.9% (15/510) in cats &gt;6y. Upper tract urolith prevalence in the United States cohort was 2.7% (5/183) in cats &#8804; 6y and 10.2% (52/510) in cats &gt;6y. The prevalence of uroliths in the upper tract or lower tract was low in the New Zealand cohort compared to that of cats in the USA cohort, irrespective of age category. Geographical location may be important when evaluating risk factors for feline urolithiasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to determine the tolerability and toxicity profile of a rapidly escalating vinblastine and prednisolone protocol (VPP) in which 3.00 mg/m[2] was administered once 7 days apart: at day 14 and at day 21. Dogs with chemotherapy-na&#239;ve MCTs presenting to the Oncology Service of a single institution were prospectively enrolled to receive escalating vinblastine, and haematology and a standardised quality-of-life questionnaire were assessed prior to each dosage. Thirty-four dogs were included: 30 with microscopic disease treated with adequate local therapy and four with macroscopic disease. Of 220 doses of vinblastine administered, 4% were associated with grade 3 and 4 toxicity. A total of 70% of dogs tolerated 3.00 mg/m[2] given 7 days apart at day 14 and 21, although 29% of dogs developed dose-limiting toxicities and 8% discontinued the protocol due to toxicity. In conclusion, VPP was well-tolerated overall, although prior to further dose intensity optimisation, it is important to determine if dose intensity is linked to outcome in canine MCT to avoid unwarranted toxicity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fifty-five neutropaenic dogs presenting to the University of Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were enrolled for a total of 57 neutropaenic episodes. The overall incidence of bacteraemia was 12.3% (n = 7/57). Three afebrile dogs and four febrile dogs were bacteraemic; this difference was not significant (P = 0.6968). The overall incidence of bacteruria was 7.5% (n = 4/53). Two afebrile dogs and two febrile dogs were bacteruric; this difference was not significant (P = 1.0). Of the positive blood cultures, the majority of organisms cultured (n = 6/7) were gram-positive organisms with one gram-negative organism. Three of the positive blood cultures showed in vitro resistance to more than one antimicrobial agent. Clinical parameters (age, body weight, heart rate, rectal temperature, neutrophil count, haematocrit and platelet count) were not predictive of bacteraemia. The results of this study were not sufficient to justify the use of blood cultures as a first-line diagnostic test for neutropaenic patients. Blood cultures may have utility in individual case management for a minority of patients in guiding antibiotic choice in the case of resistant bacterial infections. Blood cultures may serve as a tool for antimicrobial de-escalation, although further study is needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29067204</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Using oral fluids samples for indirect influenza A virus surveillance in farmed UK pigs.</Title>	<Abstract>Influenza A virus (IAV) is economically important in pig production and has broad public health implications. In Europe, active IAV surveillance includes demonstration of antigen in nasal swabs and/or demonstration of antibodies in serum (SER) samples; however, collecting appropriate numbers of individual pig samples can be costly and labour-intensive. The objective of this study was to compare the probability of detecting IAV antibody positive populations using SER versus oral fluid (OF) samples. Paired pen samples, one OF and 5-14 SER samples, were collected cross-sectional or longitudinally. A commercial nucleoprotein (NP)-based blocking ELISA was used to test 244 OF and 1004 SER samples from 123 pens each containing 20-540 pigs located in 27 UK herds. Overall, the IAV antibody detection rate was higher in SER samples compared to OFs under the study conditions. Pig age had a significant effect on the probability of detecting positive pens. For 3-9-week-old pigs the probability of detecting IAV antibody positive samples in a pen with 95% confidence intervals was 40% (23-60) for OF and 61% (0.37-0.80) for SER (P = 0.04), for 10-14-week-old pigs it was 19% (8-40) for OF and 93% (0.71-0.99) for SER (P &lt; 0.01), and for 18-20-week-old pigs it was 67% (41-85) for OF and 81% (0.63-0.91) for SER (P = 0.05). Collecting more than one OF sample in pens with more than 25 less than 18-week-old pigs should be further investigated in the future to elucidate the suitability of OF for IAV surveillance in herds with large pen sizes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Seroprevalence by Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) was estimated to 81.4 &#177; 6% and 35 &#177; 2% in cows and calves, respectively. Seropositivity to more than one serovar was noticed in 91% (81/89) of infected animals. The examination of the distribution pattern of Leptospira serovars involved in this outbreak indicates that serovar Pomona was the predominant one (75.3%), followed by Autumnalis (59.5%), Bim (58.4%) and Munchen (55%). High titres (between 400 and 6400) were found in 68.7% of the tested animals and were correlated with clinical onset of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is an underestimated pathogen in Tunisia; further investigations are needed to study the epidemiology both in man and animals and to implement effective control measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It can infect all warm-blooded vertebrate species and causes abortions and birth defects in pregnant women and pregnant ewes. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of infection with T. gondii in sheep meat in the region of Sidi Bouzid (central Tunisia) and Beja (northern Tunisia), the realization of a descriptive study of risk factors and the phylogenetic analyses of T. gondii. Neck muscle samples were obtained from 174 ewes and ewe lamb slaughtered in Sidi Bouzid and 150 lambs slaughtered in Beja. DNA was extracted from the samples using the Wizard[&#174;] genomic DNA purification kit. A nested PCR using two pairs of primers (NN 1 and NN2, Tg-NP1 and Tg-NP2) were used to detect infection with T. gondii, which was then confirmed by sequencing. Eight T. gondii amplicons were sequenced (accession number KT896498) and deposited in GenBank. The T. gondii amplicons showed 97-100% identities with GenBank sequences. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed. The nested PCR detected T. gondii DNA in 31% of animals tested in Sidi Bouzid and 32% of lambs tested in Beja. No significant difference in the prevalence of T. gondii infection was established between the two tested regions. In both regions, no significant variation of the infection depending on age, breed and locality was found.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

From the 106 samples, 93 were from dogs and 13 were from cats. Frequency of positive results for T. gondii, T. cruzi and Leptospira spp was 97.8%, 9.7% and 45.2% for dogs and 92.3%, 0.0% and 15.2% for cats, respectively. No associations with age, sex and body condition was found for T. gondii and Leptospira spp neither for the place where pets sleep, fumigation or presence of triatomes in the household in the case of T. cruzi. For leptospirosis the most common serovars found were Canicola, Autralis and Bratislava in dogs and cats with titres of 100 or 200 with exception of one dog with a titre of 400. The high frequency of seropositive dogs suggests a high circulation of the agents in the population of free roaming owned dogs and cats probably due to the lack of control of the reservoirs and vectors involved. Domestic animals in those rural communities can be sentinels to assess the risk of human exposure in the rural communities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of CAM use for the management of orthopaedic problems in a defined population of Swiss Warmblood horses. A total of 239 owners and caretakers of horses from a pre-defined database were called by a veterinarian to participate in the survey. A standardized questionnaire was designed to determine, for each orthopaedic case, where the localization of the problem was (limb or back) and if conventional medicine or CAM was used for consultation and treatment. When CAM was employed, the CAM discipline and administrator (veterinarian or alternative therapist) was defined. A total of 222 cases in 170 horses with orthopaedic problems were identified. Sixty-two horses were identified with a back problem, 96 horses with a lameness involving one or more limbs and 12 horses with a combined back problem and lameness. CAM was used commonly in this population (73.9%, 164 of 222) for both diagnostic workup and treatment of suspected orthopaedic problems, but was rarely administered by a veterinarian (12%, 27 of 222). In general, if a back problem was suspected by the owner, CAM was more frequently applied for diagnosis and treatment than in cases where a lameness was suspected; (91.9%, 68 of 74) vs. (64.9%, 96 of 148) (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Osteopathy was the most frequently applied CAM discipline. CAM was frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in Swiss Warmblood horses with suspected orthopaedic problems. CAM practitioners were consulted predominantly if a back problem was suspected, and the majority of CAM practitioners were not veterinarians.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A USDA-approved xenogeneic human tyrosinase (huTYR) plasmid DNA vaccine delivered intramuscularly induces detectable immune responses and has clinical activity in some dogs with melanoma. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of huTYR plasmid DNA administered to the skin via microseeding in dogs with spontaneous melanoma. DNA microseeding utilizes a modified tattooing device as an alternate and potentially more potent delivery method for DNA immunization. DNA was delivered to shaved inner thigh skin of six companion dogs with melanoma approximately every 14 days for a planned total of four vaccination time points. An anti-huTYR ELISA was used to test pre- and post-treatment sera. Biopsies of treated skin were obtained for detection of huTYR transgene expression. DNA microseeding was well tolerated with no significant toxicity detected beyond local site irritation, and there were no signs of autoimmunity. huTYR-expressing cells were observed in biopsies of huTYR DNA microseeding sites. Increased humoral anti-huTYR antibodies were seen in two of five evaluable dogs following microseeding compared to baseline. DNA microseeding is well tolerated in companion dogs with melanoma. Further investigation is needed to determine if combining DNA microseeding with other immunotherapy regimens potentiates this delivery platform for cancer immunotherapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is expressed by neoplastic cells in canine scMCT, but the relevance of this signalling pathway for disease pathobiology is not clear. The objective of this study was to quantify VEGF-A, VEGFR2, pVEGFR2, the VEGF co-receptor Neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) and the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase c-Cbl in canine scMCT, and to evaluate their association with disease outcome. Immunohistochemical staining for biomarkers was quantified from 14 cases of canine scMCT using manual and computer-assisted methods. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for disease-free survival (DFS) and compared using Mantel-Cox log-rank analysis. Cases with high levels of neoplastic cell VEGFR2, pVEGFR2 or c-CBL immunoreactivity had significantly reduced DFS. All cases displayed neoplastic cells positive for VEGF-A, which was significantly associated with pVEGFR2 immunoreactivity. There were also significant positive correlations between VEGFR2 and pVEGFR2, and between c-CBL and pVEGFR2 levels. This pilot study demonstrates the potential utility of these markers in a subset of scMCT in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This practice provides sustained dissemination of avian viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The objectives of this study were to assess their knowledge/awareness, risks identification and biosecurity measures on HPAI H5N1 in pastoral poultry flocks. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in systematically selected pastoral households of North-central Nigeria between May 2015 and June 2016. A total of 422 pastoralists participated in the study. Mean age of the respondents was 54.7 &#177; 11.4 SD years and 36.0% of them were in age group 50-59 years. The majority (81.3%) of respondents were of the Fulani tribe. Also, 64.9% of the respondents had no formal education and only 6.9% had tertiary education. About 30.8% of the nomadic and 81.0% of sedentary pastoralists significantly mentioned avian influenza to be a zoonotic disease. Very few nomadic (10.9%) and sedentary (26.1%) pastoralists significantly reported restriction of birds' movement to nearby water bodies as biosecurity measure. Only 7.6% of the nomadic and 16.1% of sedentary pastoralists practiced keeping of birds according to species. Sedentary pastoralists were more likely to have significant knowledge about HPAI H5N1 than the nomadic (OR: 1.76; 94% CI: 1.19-2.61). Female pastoralists were more likely to practice significant biosecurity measures against HPAI H5N1 than the males (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.28-3.09). The majority of pastoralists neither possessed adequate knowledge about avian influenza nor applied adequate biosecurity measures against it, which are the most challenging gaps. Education of pastoralists on HPAI virus infection, specifically on information about clinical signs of avian influenza in birds, transmission dynamics among different species of birds, flyways of migrating wild birds and adequate mitigation measures are recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For our study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of pulse oximetry and to determine the most clinically useful sites for probe placement in llamas and alpacas. The objectives included an analysis of pulse oximetry probes for accurate assessment of llamas and alpacas and to determine the best placement of the probes to achieve accurate readings. For study 1, saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen was measured in 184 arterial blood gas samples (SaO2) using a co-oximeter and compared to saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen simultaneously measured using a pulse oximeter (SpO2). The bias and precision for the SpO2-SaO2 difference was calculated and plotted on a Bland-Altman plot. For study 2, SpO2 data was collected 624 times from a variety of sites [tongue (T), nasal septum (NS), lip (L), vulva (V), prepuce (P), ear (E), and scrotum (S)] and recorded based upon a percentage of successful readings. Results for study 1 revealed that SpO2 was consistently 0 to -6% points different than SaO2. The bias and precision of the SpO2-SaO2 difference was -2.6 &#177; 1.7%. Results for study 2 uncovered that 540 recordings were successful readings and were obtained from the tongue and nasal septum with 97% accuracy, the lip 80%, vulva 62%, prepuce 59%, ear and scrotum &lt; 50%. We concluded that pulse oximetry probes provide reliable estimates of arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation in llamas and alpacas and is most accurately read when placed on the nasal septum or tongue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In order to assess herd productivity in cattle in Nyagatare, Eastern Rwanda, the proportional distribution of male reproductive organ abnormalities was investigated in 3087 bulls slaughtered over a 4-year period. The aim of the study was to investigate the proportional distribution of male reproductive organ abnormalities in exotic and indigenous bulls slaughtered over a 4-year period at Nyagatare abattoir in Eastern Rwanda. Positioning of the testicles was observed and recorded as the animals were assembled before slaughter. After slaughter, the internal and external reproductive organs of all bulls were removed, labelled and analysed for pathology. Significantly more indigenous (79.01%) than exotic (20.99%) animals were slaughtered (P &lt; 0.05; N = 3 087). Overall occurrence of abnormalities was significantly higher in exotic (20.83%) than in indigenous (10.33%) animals (P &lt; 0.05). Overall, abnormal location of testicles was the most common abnormality (4.08%) followed by abnormal prepuce and penis (2.33%), orchitis (1.94%), enlarged vesicular gland (0.91%), scrotal hernia (0.87%), unilateral cryptorchidism (0.81%), testicular hypoplasia (0.81%) and hydrocoele (0.78%). Abnormal location of testicles, abnormal prepuce and penis, orchitis, testicular hypoplasia and enlarged vesicular glands had significantly higher prevalence in exotic animals than in indigenous animals (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of unilateral cryptorchidism, hydrocoele and scrotal hernia between the exotic and indigenous breeds. The encountered reproductive abnormalities result in poor herd fertility manifesting as low first-service conception rates, prolonged breeding seasons and reduced weaning weights accompanied by inevitable financial losses in beef production. The observed high proportion of male reproductive abnormalities in exotic breeds might offset the professed benefits from introduction of these exotic breeds with the aim of improving productivity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Eight adult Standardbred horses received a single bolus of romifidine at a dosage of 100 &#956;g/kg. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected immediately before romifidine administration (t0), and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150 and 180 min after injection. A sedation score was recorded at the same time. The romifidine concentrations in plasma and red blood cells were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The plasma and red blood cell concentrations were correlated with the sedation at each time point. Romifidine produced a satisfactory level of sedation in all animals. The sedation was detectable in all horses for up to 105 min. All the animals returned to normal without any behavioural changes at 180 min. The romifidine concentrations in the red blood cells were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) at all time points than those in the plasma. The T1/2&#946; was 148.67 &#177; 61.59 min and body clearance was 22.55 &#177; 6.67 mL/kg per min.

In Morocco, the first cases were reported in horses in 1996 and the disease re-emerged in 2003 and in 2010. The objective of this work was to study the epidemiological situation of WNV-associated infection in Morocco, by quantifying the seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies in horses in different bioclimatic regions-zones of Morocco in 2011. During the months of May, June and July 2011, 840 serum samples were collected from horses in four regions characterized by different environmental and climatic features such as altitude, temperature and precipitation. These environmental-climatic regions are: the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb and pre-Rif region, the North Atlasic plains and plateaus region, the Atlas Mountains and pre-Atlas region and the plains and plateaus of the Oriental region. All samples were tested for the anti-WNV IgG antibodies by ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by virus neutralization (VN). An anti-WNV antibody prevalence map was developed. A total of 261 samples (31%) were found positive by both techniques. The prevalence of the infection was higher in the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb and pre-Rif region, in the northern part of the country. Available data concerning the previous WNV-associated disease outbreaks in Morocco and the preliminary results of this serological survey suggest that the Moroccan northwest is the region at highest risk for WNV circulation. In this region, the climate is more humid with higher rainfall than other regions and milder winter temperatures exist. In the same area, the presence of migratory bird settlements may affect the risk of virus introduction and amplification.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The aim of this pilot study was to: (1) test the feasibility of a protocol for monitoring farm animal welfare in Serbia, (2) ascertain preliminary data on animal-based outcomes of farm welfare and (3) gain insight into Serbian farmers' understanding of animal welfare as part of a wider project working towards inclusion of animal-based assessments in a 'higher welfare' voluntary assurance scheme. This study encompasses the first national survey of farm animal welfare in which animal-based outcomes were tested on 105 farms by a total of ten trained assessors. Data on the views and aspirations of the farmers from these 105 farms were also systematically gathered during face-to-face interviews. Existing animal-based measures for pigs, sheep, dairy cows and broilers that have been successfully applied and identified as valid, reliable and feasible measures in other countries, were found to be largely transferable. However, some on-farm protocols, previously used in other countries, had to be shortened for logistical reasons when used in Serbia. Our findings suggest that further refinement may be needed in order to allow local application of all measures. While the term 'animal welfare' has only recently been introduced into the Serbian language, seventy-three percent of farmers had heard of it. Overall, few positive associations were found between farmer satisfaction with animals' living conditions and animal-based data. Many farmers had aspirations to develop and expand their farms, which may potentially enhance animal welfare, but these farmers identified that financial and technical advice and support would be needed in order to achieve these goals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A survey of the risk of spread of HPAI in two HPAI-infected and -uninfected Nigerian states were studied. A cross-sectional study to detect avian influenza (AI) H5 antibodies was conducted using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 950 birds' sera were tested for AI H5 antibodies. Questionnaires were also administered to evaluate risks of AI spread in two states of Nigeria in 2013. AI H5 seroprevalence of 3% and 5% were obtained in Bauchi and Gombe states, respectively. Free flying and captive wild birds had 15% and 11% seroprevalence, respectively. Ninety-two per cent AI awareness and 90% preparedness to report outbreaks of poultry diseases were recorded. Veterinary personnel, radio and television contributed 87% to HPAI awareness. Of the 10 risk categories evaluated, Gombe state had 3 moderate and 1 high risk of AI virus spread. Bauchi state recorded 5 moderate and 1 high risk of AI virus spread. Chi-square analysis showed associations of altitude, temperature, rainfall and presence of live bird markets (LBMs) (P &lt; 0.05) to AI seroprevalence. Odds ratio at 95% CI (1.313-6.333) indicated LBMs presence to be three times more likely to influence AI occurrence. HPAI H5N1 resurged in many states and occurred for the first time in Gombe state in 2015. Veterinary personnel, radio and television may be reliable in changing farmers' attitudes to adopt good biosecurity practices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A source of allogeneic eMSCs might be the bone marrow from euthanized horses. The purpose of this study was to compare in vitro characteristics of equine bone marrow derived eMSC (eBM-MSCs) from euthanized horses (eut-MSCs) and from narcotized horses (nar-MSCs). Eut-MSCs and nar-MSCs showed typical eMSC marker profiles (positive: CD44, CD90; negative: CD11a/CD18 and MHCII) and possessed tri-lineage differentiation characteristics. Although CD105 and MHCI expression varied, no differences were detected between eut-MSCs and nar-MSCs. Proliferation characteristics did not differ between eut-MSCs and nar-MSCs, but age dependent decrease in proliferation and increase in MHCI expression was detected. These results suggest the possible use of eut-MSCs for therapeutic applications and production of commercial available eBM-MSC products.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29152318</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Gut microbiota composition may relate to weight loss rate in obese pet dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Obese dogs seem to have a different gut microbiome (GM) composition compared to lean dogs, and in humans, GM composition may negatively impact the ability to lose weight in some individuals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between exercise, weight-loss and the composition of GM in dogs. Eighteen obese pet dogs were recruited for a 12-week weight-loss intervention. All dogs were fed restrictively with a commercial high-protein/high-fibre dry diet, and eight of these dogs were enrolled in an exercise program in addition to the diet intervention. Faecal samples were collected and the dogs were weighed at week 0, week 6 and week 12. GM composition was determined using MiSeq-based tag-encoded 16S rRNA gene high-throughput amplicon sequencing, and concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by gas-liquid chromatography. Total weight loss, food allowance and GM were not changed by exercise inclusion. However, Megamonas abundance negatively correlated with weight loss rate and Ruminococcaceae relative abundance was lower at 12 weeks in dogs with a faster weight loss rate (&#8805;1% per week) compared with slower weight loss rate (&lt;1% per week) independent of exercise. Acetic and propionic acid concentrations decreased in the dogs with a faster weight loss rate. Members of Megamonas and Ruminococcaceae produce acetic and propionic acids and we therefore interpret that having a GM that favour SCFA production may negatively affect weight loss rate in dogs. Weight loss rate in dogs may be related to the composition of the GM and its production of metabolites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Treatment of horses with sodium bicarbonate did not result in any adverse events. Mean TCO 2 concentration was significantly higher from 1 to 8 h in the sodium bicarbonate-treated horses compared to the untreated controls. Within an hour, administration of sodium bicarbonate increased the TCO 2 level from 31.5 &#177; -2.5 (SD) to 34.0 &#177; 2.65 (SD) mmol/L and at 2-8 h post-administration, the TCO 2 level was above the 36 mmol/L cut-off level. In all quality control analysis of Australian standard by Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer, the instrument slightly over estimated the TCO 2 level but the values were in close agreement with mean TCO 2 level being 38.03 with &#177; 0.87 mmol/L (SD). Expanded uncertainty was calculated using different levels of confidence interval. Based on 99.5% confidence interval using 0.805% expanded uncertainty using mean measured concentration of 38.05 mmol/L, it was estimated that any race samples TCO 2 level higher than 38.5 mmol/L will be indicative of sodium bicarbonate administration using Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer in Louisiana.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29468076</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Capromorelin: a ghrelin receptor agonist and novel therapy for stimulation of appetite in dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Ghrelin is a hormone, secreted from cells in the stomach, which is important in the regulation of appetite and food intake in mammals. It exerts its action by binding to a specific G-protein-coupled receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) which is found in areas of the brain associated with the regulation of food intake. Ghrelin causes a release of growth hormone (GH) through binding to GHS-R1a in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. A class of compounds known as growth hormone secretagogues, or ghrelin receptor agonists, were developed for therapeutic use in humans for the stimulation of GH in the frail elderly, and have subsequently been studied for their effects on increasing appetite and food intake, increasing body weight, building lean muscle mass, and treating cachexia. Subsequent research has shown that ghrelin has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. This article reviews the basic physiology of ghrelin and the ghrelin receptor agonists, including the available evidence of these effects in vitro and in vivo in rodent models, humans, dogs and cats. One of these compounds, capromorelin, has been FDA-approved for the stimulation of appetite in dogs (ENTYCE [&#174;]). The data available on the safety and effectiveness of capromorelin is reviewed, along with a discussion of the potential clinical applications for ghrelin receptor agonists in both human and veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A total number of 96 cattle from five farms were evaluated. T. annulata and T. evansi prevalences were 61% [56/66] and 10% [7/13], respectively, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, while co-infection was present in 6% [4/8] of the tested animals at a CI of 95%. There was a significant correlation between age and the prevalence of T. annulata infection, whereas, there was no significant association shown with the age of cattle and T. evansi infection. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the T. annulata Tams1 gene and T. evansi ITS1 rDNA gene were highly conserved with 97.1-100% and 98.3-100% sequence identity, respectively.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Dogs may harbour Salmonella in their intestines and can easily shed Salmonella in the environment with the possibility of transmission to humans. Thus, monitoring is essential to understand the role of dogs in zoonotic transmission. The objectives of this study were to determine the shedding of Salmonella by owned, apparently healthy dogs in Grenada, West Indies, to identify the serovars, and to examine their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Faecal samples collected during August to October, 2016 from 144 non-diarrhoeic owned dogs were examined by enrichment and selective culture for the presence of Salmonella spp. Eight (5.6%) of the tested animals were culture positive, yielding 35 Salmonella isolates that belonged to six serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. These were serovars Arechavaleta from two dogs, Arechavaleta and Montevideo from one dog, and Javiana, Rubislaw, Braenderup and Kiambu from one dog each. All these serovars have been reported as causes of human salmonellosis globally. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests on 35 isolates showed absence of resistance to the currently used drugs for cases of human salmonellosis, including ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. One isolate (2.9%) was resistant to neomycin, two isolates (5.7%) showed intermediate susceptibility to neomycin, and another (2.9%) had intermediate susceptibility to tetracycline. This is the first report of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibilities of non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars from dogs in Grenada. This study shows that dogs in Grenada may be involved in the epidemiology of salmonellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It utilised a complete factorial design replicated on 18 smallholder cattle farms in three villages in Pursat province, Cambodia. Antibody responses from the 108 cattle involved were assessed by serological examination of blood samples collected at primary vaccination (day 0), at booster vaccination (day 30) and finally at 60 days post primary vaccination. Vaccination responses to the inactivated vaccine were assessed by testing for antibodies directed against FMD structural proteins in a liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE test) and differentiated from responses to natural infection by examining antibody titres against non-structural viral proteins (NSPE test). LPBE results indicated that the mean log10 LPBE antibody titres of all experimental cattle increased from below protective levels at day 0 to protective levels at 30 days post primary vaccination, and increased further at 60 days post primary vaccination. Storage at ambient temperature for 1 week had no effect on antibody response to vaccination. However, freezing the vaccine for a week or use of a half dose resulted in significant reduction in titres at day 60 (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively). The results of this study reinforce the need to store FMD vaccines within the range recommended by the manufacturers and to adhere to the specified dosage instructions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One of them died on June 24 and the second died on July 3. Shortly after, the remaining pigs also fell ill and died from the same illness by 10 August 2015. We investigated the aetiology, epidemiological and clinical features of the outbreak. We recorded the clinical signs and symptoms for each pig with the date of onset of illness. Veterinarians conducted post-mortem examinations on the 12 dead pigs, they collected tissue samples from the dead pigs and placed them in a tube containing 1 mL of nucleic acid extraction buffer (lysis buffer). We tested all the tissue samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect classical swine fever virus (CSFV) because the animals' symptoms matched those of this disease. We also conducted a phylogentic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene segment of CSFV detected in a lung tissue sample. The attack rate (22/22) and the case fatality were 100%. The predominant symptoms of the disease included high fever, cough, diarrhoea and swaying movements of the hind legs prior to death. Of the 12 pigs tissue samples tested, all had evidence of the presence of CSFV RNA by rRT-PCR. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus belongs to genotype 2.2, which is closely related to CSFV genotype 2.2 reported in India. Our investigation suggests that CSF is circulating in pigs, posing a risk for communities in Bangladesh that rely on pigs for economic income and dietary protein. Future research could focus on estimating the disease and economic burden of CSFV in pig rearing areas to determine if interventions might be warranted or cost-effective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

There is currently no standard of care for managing this condition and it has not been reported in the Hungarian Vizsla. This case series documents the clinical features of canine pigmented viral plaques in Hungarian Vizsla dogs and the treatment of a severe case using a novel topical agent tigilanol tiglate (EBC-46). A 4-year-old spayed Hungarian Vizsla in Australia was presented for multiple cutaneous pigmented plaques extending from the ventral cervical region. Lesions were neither painful nor pruritic. The number and size of these sessile plaques increased over time, with the largest lesions eventually taking on an exophytic (wart-like) appearance. These lesions did not affect the dog's wellbeing. Two much less severe cases in a 5-year-old Vizsla from the UK and a 7-year-old Vizsla from New Zealand were also diagnosed. Histology was consistent with papillomavirus-induced pigmented plaques and CPV-4 DNA sequences were amplified from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue using the polymerase chain reaction from the most severely affected patient. Topical imiquimod was ineffective although used for only a short time. Two topical applications of novel anti-neoplastic diterpene ester tigilanol tiglate as a gel, 9 days apart, greatly reduced the size and number of lesions in a limited portion of skin treated, over the lateral hock. While CPV-4 has been previously reported to cause pigmented plaques, most commonly on pug dogs, but sporadically on other breeds, this is the first report of this virus causing plaques in Hungarian Vizslas. The cases illustrate some of the difficulties in diagnosing papillomavirus-induced disease in dogs, especially in its early stages. Topical tigilanol tiglate is a potentially useful topical therapy for this viral-induced disorder of cell growth and represents a treatment deserving of further investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Post-mortem examination revealed a copious pleural effusion with multifocal to coalescing numerous white to grey nodular masses on the serosal surface of the pericardium, lungs and thoracic cavity. In addition, the left thyroid gland was markedly enlarged. A thoracic mesothelioma and C-cell adenoma with amyloid deposits of the left thyroid gland were diagnosed by histopathology and confirmed by immunohistochemistry employing antibodies against cytokeratin (CK), vimentin and calcitonin. Amyloid deposits in the thyroid tumour were confirmed by Congo red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Mesothelioma remains an uncommon neoplasm encountered in aged horses. Discussion includes the diagnostic challenge of differentiating carcinomatosis from mesothelioma by histology and differentiating reactive and neoplastic mesothelial cells by cytology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several systems for analysing acid-base disturbances have been reported, but the prognostic abilities of these systems have not been compared in dogs. The objectives of this retrospective study were to determine if the commonly used acid-base interpretation methods (Henderson-Hasselbalch, Stewart and semi-quantitative) have prognostic value, and to compare the performance of the three methods. Electronic medical records were searched to create a database containing point-of-care blood-gas, electrolyte and serum chemistry values for 1024 dogs assessed at a university teaching hospital. Dogs with contemporaneous blood-gas analysis, blood lactate and serum biochemistry samples were eligible for study, and only the first recorded analyses for each patient visit were included. Components of the Henderson-Hasselbalch, Stewart and semi-quantitative methods were calculated. To assess prognostic ability and to compare analysis system performance, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for survival to hospital discharge were created. Of the 1024 dogs identified, case fatality rate was 23.8%. Area under the ROC curve did not exceed 0.63 for any calculated variable. Performance of all three analysis systems was similar. While some acid-base abnormalities identified were associated with mortality, no individual abnormality or system output yielded sensitive and specific cut-off values for mortality prediction, and no interpretation method outperformed the others. This study suggests that initial acid-base abnormalities have limited prognostic utility and that various analysis systems can be used to assess acid-base disturbances in critically ill dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Adequate knowledge of the diversity of circulating strains of PPR virus will help livestock authorities choose appropriate vaccines. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of PPR and characterize the strains circulating in Bangladesh. Veterinarians enrolled goats showing signs consistent with PPR, including diarrhoea, fever and respiratory distress, from three veterinary hospitals. Post-treatment follow up was carried out to ascertain health outcomes of the goats. Faecal and throat swab samples were collected from the goats and tested for PPRV RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Nucleotide sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of two structural genes, the nucleocapsid (N gene), and the haemagglutinin (H gene) were studied to determine the genetic variations of PPRV strains. Of the 539 goats enrolled, 38% (203/539) had detectable RNA for PPRV. We were able to follow up with 91% (184/203) of the PPRV infected goats; 44 of them died (24%). PPRV was more frequently identified in the summer (45%) than in the rainy season (29%) (Odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-3.1). Bangladeshi strains were phylogenetically similar to the lineage IV PPRV strains; showing particularly strong affiliation with Tibetan and Indian strains. PPR is a common viral infection of the goats in Bangladesh, with a high case-fatality rate. This study confirms the circulation of lineage IV PPRV in the country with unique amino acid substitutions in N and H proteins and provides baseline data for vaccine development and implementation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This study aims to characterise BCoV genetically on the basis of the N gene. A total of 114 faecal samples from beef and dairy calves with or without clinical symptoms of diarrhoea from five Brazilian states (S&#227;o Paulo, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso and Bahia) were evaluated between 2008 and 2015 by technique of Semi-nested RT-PCR for gene N and genealogical analysis. Of the 114 samples analysed, 14.91% (17/114) were positive. BCoV was detected in 22.72% (10/44) of the animals with diarrhoea and in 10% (7/70) of asymptomatic animals. BCoV was identified in calves from rural properties located in all of the regions sampled. Genealogical analysis showed that the Brazilian sequences of BCoV for the gene which codes for the N protein can be broken down into two distinct clusters, and the samples from this study were closely linked to Asian strains. These results contribute to the molecular characterization of BCoV in Brazil and are the first report of the circulation of BCoV in the states of Santa Catarina and Bahia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29707919</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Optimising lameness detection in dairy cattle by using handheld infrared thermometers.</Title>	<Abstract>Lameness is one of the most serious economic and welfare issues in the dairy industry. Early detection of lameness can be difficult, but provision of early treatment is crucial. Previous studies have used infrared thermography to show that increased foot temperature (FT) is associated with lameness and foot lesions. However, poor accuracy has limited the management application potential. This study analysed ambient-temperature (AT)-adjusted foot-surface temperatures and temperature differences between the hind feet of individual cows to enhance lameness detection. Cow FTs were recorded on a 990-cow farm using an infrared thermometer fortnightly for 6 months. Additionally, mobility level was scored using the AHDB Dairy 4-point scale. The averages of FTs and ATs were 23.83 &#177; 0.03&#176;C and 13.99 &#177; 1.60&#176;C, respectively. The FT of cows with lameness was significantly higher than that of cows without lameness (P &lt; 0.001). Increases in FTs correlated with the mobility score (MS) (P &lt; 0.001). According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the optimal threshold based on actual FTs was 23.3&#176;C with 78.5% sensitivity and 39.2% specificity. However, the ROC curve for the AT-adjusted FT and FT difference parameters showed minimal improvements over the FT in detecting lameness. In conclusion, the infrared thermometer results demonstrated the association between elevated FTs and lameness, but further improvements to this detection technique will be required before it can be implemented as a management tool for detecting cows that could benefit from treatment. With additional validation, the technique could be used as a screening device to identify cows in need of further assessment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Few studies and reports have been performed to estimate the true prevalence of animal brucellosis in the Sultanate of Oman; however, no incidence of the disease was previously reported in Al Jabal Al Akhdar. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of brucellosis in goats in eight villages in Al Jebal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman, namely: Al Aqaieb, Al Helailat, Al Ghilayil, Hail Al Hedap, Da'an Al Hamra, Shnoot, Al Qasha'e and Al Sarah, Al Jabal Al Akhdar in the Sultanate of Oman. In this study we used different diagnostic serological tests, namely, RBT, I-ELISA and CFT to study the prevalence of Brucella infection in goats in Al Jabal Al Akhdar. Statistical analysis using Kappa statistics was used to compare the performance of the serological tests. Biochemical tests and species-specific Multiplex PCR were used to identify the brucella species involved in the infection. A structured questionnaire and Chi-square (x[2]) statistical analysis was used to identify related brucellosis risk factors. This study is the first to reveal brucellosis infection in goats in eight villages in Al Jebal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman, namely: Al Aqaieb, Al Helailat, Al Ghilayil, Hail Al Hedap, Da'an Al Hamra, Shnoot, Al Qasha'e and Al Sarah, with an overall seroprevalence of 11.1%. The study also compared the performance of three different serological tests, namely, RBT, I-ELISA and CFT. Statistical analysis using Kappa statistics showed that the degree of agreement was best seen between RBT and CFT (96%), followed by RBT, I- ELISA (91.4%) and CFT and I- ELISA (89.2%). Biochemical tests and species-specific Multiplex PCR showed the typical profile for B. melitensis. A structured questionnaire and Chi-square (x[2]) statistical analysis indicated that the presence of abortion is the major risk factor for the prevalence of brucellosis, whereas age and sex were not significant factors in the tested animals. Besides, poor knowledge about brucellosis, consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products, free trade of animals and the introduction of new animal breeds to herds were all contributing risk factors to the prevalence of brucellosis. The prevalence of human brucellosis obtained verbally from pastoralists gave an insight that brucellosis could pose a public health hazard, especially in those high-risk groups, mainly the pastoralists in the study area. Because of their constant and increasing interaction with their animals, pastoralists could be at a high risk of occupational infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The effects of halothane on the avian EEG are of interest, as this agent has been widely used to study nociception and analgesia in mammals. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of halothane anaesthesia on the EEG of the chicken. Twelve female Hyline Brown chickens aged 8-10 weeks were anaesthetized with halothane in oxygen. For each bird, anaesthesia was progressively increased from 1-1.5 to 2 times the Minimum Anesthetic Concentration (MAC), then progressively decreased again. At each concentration, a sample of EEG was recorded after a 10-min stabilization period. The mean Total Power (PTOT), Median Frequency (F50) and 95% Spectral Edge Frequency (F95) were calculated at each halothane MAC, along with the Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR). Burst suppression was rare and BSR did not differ between halothane concentrations. Increasing halothane concentration from 1 to 2 MAC resulted in a decrease in F50 and increase in PTOT , while F95 increased when MAC was reduced from 1.5 to 1. The results indicate dose-dependent spectral EEG changes consistent with deepening anaesthesia in response to increasing halothane MAC. As burst suppression was rare, even at 1.5 or 2 times MAC, halothane may be a suitable anaesthetic agent for use in future studies exploring EEG activity in anaesthetized birds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Inhalation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroencephalography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Halothane</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A routine influenza booster vaccination was used as a model to study the effects of Equi-Strath[&#174;] supplementation on the immune response. Twenty healthy Franches-Montagnes stallions with pre-existing antibody levels were randomly divided into a study group (SG, n = 10) receiving 0.06 mL/kg bodyweight of Equi-Strath[&#174;] , and a control group (CG, n = 10), receiving the same amount of placebo, daily. The supplement and placebo were given from week 1 until week 14 of the trial. After 10 weeks, the horses were vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing equine influenza strains of the H3N8 subtype. Antibody titres in blood were measured at day 0 before vaccination, and 14 and 32 days after vaccination. In addition, a complete blood count (CBC) was performed on day 0 and day 32. A linear increase of haemagglutination inhibition titres in both groups was observed after vaccination, but with no difference between treatment groups. CBC components remained unaffected by treatment. In conclusion, daily Equi-Strath[&#174;] supplementation did not affect the adaptive immune response in stallions after a routine commercial H3N8 influenza booster vaccination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunization, Secondary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza A Virus, H3N8 Subtype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orthomyxoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Efficient sequencing, share of genomic data combined with the implementation of epidemiological tools would be the ideal approach for study and analysis of transboundary infectious diseases as PED.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Alignment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, RNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29851309</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Description of a new approach for great auricular and auriculotemporal nerve blocks: A cadaveric study in foxes and dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Otitis externa is a painful condition that may require surgical intervention in dogs. A balanced analgesia protocol should combine systemic analgesic agents and local anaesthesia techniques. The aim of the study was to find anatomical landmarks for the great auricular and the auriculotemporal nerves that transmit nociceptive information from the ear pinna and to develop the optimal technique for a nerve block. The study consisted of two phases. In phase I, one fox cadaver was used for dissection and anatomical localization of the auricular nerves to derive landmarks for needle insertion. Eight fox cadavers were subsequently used to evaluate the accuracy of the technique by injecting methylene blue bilaterally. In phase II findings from phase I were applied in four Beagle canine cadavers. A block was deemed successful if more than 0.6 cm of the nerve's length was stained. Successful great auricular nerve block was achieved by inserting the needle superficially along the wing of the atlas with the needle pointing towards the jugular groove. For the auriculotemporal nerve block the needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin at the caudal lateral border of the zygomatic arch, close to the temporal process. The overall success rate was 24 out of 24 (100%) and 22 out of 24 (91%) for the great auricular and the auriculotemporal nerves, respectively, while the facial nerve was stained on three occasions. Our results suggest that it is feasible to achieve a block of the auricular nerves, based on anatomical landmarks, without concurrently affecting the facial nerve.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foxes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mandibular Nerve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nerve Block</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Nerves</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study was designed to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for the molecular detection of E. canis by the amplification of a portion of its 16S rRNA gene, as well as the effects of this alpha-proteobacterium on the haematological parameters of the sampled dogs and the risk factors associated with E. canis infection. A total of 151 blood samples were collected from dogs of various breeds at three sampling sites (Lahore, Rawalpindi/Islamabad and Multan) in Punjab, Pakistan. Data regarding the epidemiological factors (including age, gender, breed, body temperature, deworming, vaccination, mucous membrane status, hydration status, the presence of haematuria and tick infestation) were collected through a questionnaire at the time of sample collection. A 400 bp DNA fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of E. canis was amplified from 42 dog blood samples (28% of the total), [Lahore (N = 24), Rawalpindi/Islamabad (N = 13) and Multan (N = 05)] through PCR. Data analysis revealed that the character of the animals (age, sex and breed) had no significant association (P &gt; 0.05) with the presence of E. canis. Various haematological parameters were also compared, and the results revealed that all of the parameters remained unaffected, except significantly lower white blood cell counts (P = 0.004) in E. canis-positive blood samples, as compared with the control group. We concluded that this is the first molecular confirmation of canine infection by E. canis using PCR. Moreover, no specific epidemiological parameter was found associated with the prevalence of E. canis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichia canis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukocyte Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In the period from April 2010 to April 2012, 842 faecal samples from dogs and cats from Styria, Austria were examined for Campylobacter (C.) species (spp.). All samples were subjected to qualitative microbiological culture testing, and additionally, some of them have been studied using qualitative real-time PCR. In microbiological culture, 5.9% of all samples investigated were C. spp. positive. With 3.1% out of positive samples, C. jejuni was the most common type. Campylobacter upsaliensis (C. upsaliensis) was detected only in 0.5% of the samples. The remaining positive samples (2.4%) were classified as C. species (sp.). C. coli could not be found in any of the samples. A higher prevalence of C. jejuni was found in kittens with 14.3% and in diarrhoeic dogs (7.4%) and cats (23.8%). The real-time PCR revealed for dogs and cats together, 27% of C. jejuni-positive faecal and 8% positive faecal swap samples. The obtained C. jejuni strains underwent antibiotic resistance testing using three different tests (agar diffusion, MIC testing and E-test) with different numbers of antibiotics. From the antibiotics used in this study, several showed high test-dependent resistance rates (cephalexin, cefovecin, kanamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, penicillin G, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, nalidixic acid). Overall, the prevalence of C. spp. in this study was very low compared to others, with the exception of C. jejuni in kittens and diarrhoeic animals. The results of the real-time PCR suggest that the rate of colonization of C. jejuni was actually higher than the results of the culture showed. As the resistance rates of C. jejuni isolates partly were very high, possible transmission of (multi-) resistant C. jejuni strains to humans especially from kittens and diarrhoeic animals must be expected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Austria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter jejuni</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The latter family unites human and veterinary pathogens (Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Neorickettsia bacteria) with Wolbachia, some of which are obligatory endosymbionts of pathogenic filarial nematodes. The epidemiology of Anaplasmataceae and Filariidae species infecting dogs living in kennels in New Caledonia was studied. 64 EDTA blood samples were screened for the presence of Anaplasmataceae and filarial nematodes. Molecular study was conducted using primers and probe targeting the of 23S rRNA long fragment of Anaplasmataceae species. Next, all blood sample was screened for the presence of Filariidae species targeting the primers and probe targeting the COI gene, as well as primers targeting the COI and 5S rRNA genes of all filarial worms. Anaplasma platys was identified in 8/64 (12.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4-20.6%) and Wolbachia endosymbiont of Dirofilaria immitis in 8/64 (12.5%, CI: 4.4-20.6%). Filariidae species investigation was performed and showed that 11/64 (17.2%, CI: 7.9-26.4%) dogs were infected with D. immitis, whereas, 2/64 (3.1%, CI: 0.0-7.3%) were infected with Acanthocheilonema reconditum. Finally, we checked the occurrence of co-infection between Anaplasmataceae and Filariidae species. Co-occurrence with Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. immitis was observed in seven dogs, one dog was co-infected with A. platys and A. reconditum and another was co-infected with Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. immitis and A. reconditum.

In an attempt to resolve this paradox, we set out to determine the factors associated with the occurrence of this behaviour and to evaluate the efficacy of 11 products marketed for treating coprophagy as well as behaviour modification procedures. Because a large sample of dogs was needed to address these issues, two web-based surveys were utilized. One, intended to compare coprophagic dogs and non-coprophagic dogs, yielded 1552 returns. The other, yielding 1475 usable returns, specifically recruited owners of coprophagic dogs to gather information about the characteristics of coprophagy and treatment success. The findings revealed that 16% of dogs sampled engaged in frequent conspecific coprophagy, defined as having been seen eating stools at least six times. No evidence was found relating the coprophagy to diet or the dog's age. Coprophagic dogs were as easily house trained as non-coprophagic dogs, suggesting a normal aversion to faeces. Coprophagic dogs were more likely to be reported as greedy eaters than non-coprophagic dogs. The reported success rate of the commercial products and behaviour modification approaches was close to zero, indicating that the behaviour is not readily changed. The coprophagy was overwhelmingly directed at fresh stools, defined as being no more than 2 days old. A hypothesis is offered that coprophagy reflects a tendency inherited from the ancestral wolf to keep the den area free of faecal-borne intestinal parasites that might be deposited in the den resting area and would typically have parasite ova that are not initially infective, but could develop infective larvae after 2 days. An evolved parasite defence strategy to consume fresh faeces in the rest area would be adaptive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coprophagia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 9-month-old, indoors-only, female spayed, domestic medium hair cat presented for vomiting, open-mouth breathing and acute collapse. The initial physical examination identified moderate to severe hypothermia [35&#176;C (95&#176;F)], obtunded mentation, weak femoral pulses, tachycardia (heart rate 240 beats per min), pale pink mucous membranes and significant splenomegaly on abdominal palpation. Immediate diagnostics performed [packed cell volume and total solids (PCV, TS), venous blood gas and electrolytes] revealed severe anaemia (PCV 12%), hypoproteinaemia (TS = 2.2 g/dl), and severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.956). Additional diagnostics performed included Feline Leukaemia Virus and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus testing (FeLV/FIV), complete blood count (CBC) with pathology review, serum biochemistry profile, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), urinalysis, and abdominal radiographs. Abdominal radiographs were consistent with gas within hepatic and splenic veins and parenchyma, small intestinal walls and colonic wall. Due to the guarded prognosis, euthanasia was elected. Necropsy was performed and the most significant gross and histopathological findings included intra-luminal and intra-mural intestinal haemorrhage and vascular congestion with mild neutrophilic hepatitis, and marked hepatic periportal emphysema. Clostridium perfrigens and Escherichia coli were cultured from the bowel wall; no bacterial growth from the liver or spleen was identified. This case report describes idiopathic emphysematous hepatitis, with concurrent emphysema of the spleen and intestinal wall and intestinal haemorrhage. To the authors' knowledge, this type of pathology in a feline patient has not been previously described.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emphysema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatitis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29851315</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Consumption of antibacterial molecules in broiler production in Morocco.</Title>	<Abstract>Monitoring the use of antibacterial agents in food-producing animals is crucial in order to reduce antimicrobial resistance, selection and dissemination of resistant bacterial strains, and drug residues in the animal food products. The broiler production sector is considered a great consumer of antibacterials and incriminated in the rise of antimicrobial resistance level in zoonotic bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Following recommendations from the OIE and WHO, a survey was conducted about the use and consumption of several antibacterial agents in Moroccan broiler flocks. More than 5 million broilers were randomly surveyed at the prescriber level, that is, via the veterinary clinics involved in their health management. The results showed that 93% of the flocks received at least one antibacterial treatment of minimum 3 days duration. Enrofloxacin, colistin and trimethoprim/sulphonamides were the most used antibacterials followed by oxytetracycline, florfenicol and amoxicillin. Oxytetracycline, enrofloxacin and colistin were overdosed in most of the administration, while amoxicillin and the combination of trimethoprim/sulphonamides were under-dosed. The total amount of antibacterial consumed in the survey was 63.48 mg/kg and the Animal Level of Exposure to Antimicrobials (ALEA) was 94.45%. The reasons for this frequent use were related mainly to the poor quality of broiler production management. Chicks and animal feed provided to producers were of variable quality. Management of rearing stock density was often poor and biosecurity inadequate, and broilers were challenged by a high prevalence of infectious diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Morocco</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Based on trends in zoological institutions to perform non-anaesthetized health exams, it is applicable to establish normal values in conscious animals, as anaesthesia and sedation can alter these parameters. The goal of this study was to estimate intraocular pressures using rebound tonometry and measure tear production values in a group of healthy, conscious, European fallow deer utilizing chute restraint. Evaluation of these values with regards to instrumentation and restraint variables will be assessed. Complete ophthalmic examinations, including estimation of IOP with rebound tonometry and measurement of tear production with Schirmer tear tests (STT) were performed on nine conscious European fallow deer (Dama dama) restrained in a chute. Correlations between IOP on the unspecified (P) and the equine (H) settings, as well as IOP and STT differences between left (OS) and right (OD) eyes were evaluated, in addition to assessment of correlations between right and left lateral recumbency on IOP and STT. Tear production measurements were 18.7 &#177; 5.1 mm min[-1] with a 95% confidence interval (CI) range of 16.4-21.1 mm min[-1] . Intraocular pressure measurements for the P setting were 16.1 &#177; 4.5 mmHg with a 95% CI range of 14.1-18.2 mmHg, and for the H setting were 21.5 &#177; 5.1 mmHg with a 95% CI range of 19.1-23.9 mmHg. No statistically significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) was found between OS and OD in any test. Neither left nor right lateral recumbency was found to have a statistically significant effect on IOP or STT. This study represents the first assessment of ophthalmic parameters in conscious fallow deer with rebound tonometry and STT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, considerable variation exists in types of information reported, especially relating to surgical margins. The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate how information is presented within canine MCT histopathology reports across the United States. The reports were collected from medical and surgical oncologists from 4 geographic regions of the USA: Midwest, Northeast, South and West. All reports were obtained between January 1st 2012 and May 1st 2015. Inclusion criteria required that the final diagnosis was MCT, a microscopic description was present, and it was not a scar revision. Three hundred and sixty-eight reports were collected from 26 contributors. While the majority of the reports contained a clinical history (85.9%), information for certain prognostic indicators such as location and mass size was lacking. Grading with both Patnaik and Kiupel systems were described in 76.5% of reports with a single system being used in 7.1% and 15.2% of reports, respectively. Subcutaneous MCT were assigned a grading scheme in 67.2% of reports with 33.3% stating appropriate limitations. Surgical margins were reported in 92% of the reports with 77.2% describing deep and lateral margins separately. Tissue composing the deep margin was only described in 10.9% of the reports. The present results indicate reporting of MCT has variability across pathologists with inconsistencies present in the reporting of clinical history, margin evaluation and subcutaneous MCT grading.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Given the widespread presence of the soft tick vectors - Ornithodoros and the recently discovered hard tick vectors, as well as their close association with animal hosts, it is highly likely that infection occurs, but is rarely reported to be of veterinary importance. Sporadic reports of canine infection, some being fatal through to probable cause of abortion in horses have been published. Some of these pathogens exist in regions where there are limited diagnostic facilities, hence, they are likely to be missed and their impact on productivity may be unquantified. Here we review available literatures on cases of TBRF in domestic and wild animals in order to show their potential veterinary medical impact. Future efforts using field and laboratory surveys are needed to determine pathogenesis, vector competence and distribution in animals, their impact on animal health and productivity as well as to prevent further spill to the human population, where it is already a public health problem in some parts of the world.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Borrelia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Relapsing Fever</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

BTV is transmitted by female midges of the genus Culicoides. In Brazil, information on the prevalence of BTV in cattle is limited, so the objective of this work was to identify BTV serotypes in cattle. The State of S&#227;o Paulo was divided into seven cattle-producing regions, and in each of them, 300 cattle farms were randomly selected. One animal from each farm (out of a total of 1,598 farms) was selected and its sera tested by virus neutralization technique against BTV serotypes (1-24 and 26) for determining antibody titre. Moreover, for each sampled farm, an epidemiological questionnaire was submitted to verify the type of cattle production and the zootechnical and sanitary practices carried out, which could be associated with a higher risk of BTV infection. In this study, antibodies (percentage, [95% confidence interval]) were identified against 11 serotypes: BTV-1 (22.15%, [15.72-27.92]), BTV-2 (31.03%, [26.65-37.98]), BTV-3 (18.96%, [12.42-24.90]), BTV-4 (24.90% [19.41-29.12]), BTV-9 (6.82%, [1.45-11.72]), BTV-12 (7.50%, [2.82-12.51]), BTV-17 (23.90%, [17.35-29.35]), BTV-19 (10.20%, [4.62-5.56]), BTV-21 (30.66%, [25.00-36.00]), BTV-22 (12.14%, [5.91-18.55]), BTV-26 (57.00%, [51.41-63.59]). In this study, for the first time in Brazil serological evidence of the presence of serotypes BTV-2, BTV-9, BTV-21 and BTV-26 is reported.

The economic losses are due to early culling, reduced growth rate, progressive weight loss and reduced production. It is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Johne's disease was reported in cattle in Bhutan, based on clinical signs and histopathology; in the late 1990s samples from one mithun that was suspected to have died due to this disease was confirmed by molecular testing at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, Australia. However, no detailed study on prevalence of JD has been attempted in Bhutan. Objective of this study was to conduct serosurveillance to determine the national prevalence of Johne's disease in cattle for the period 2013-2014 to provide the basis for planning a future control strategy. A national serosurvey was conducted wherein a two-stage sampling procedure was used with 95% confidence and an error level of &#177;0.05. The sample size required for the survey was calculated using the software-Survey Toolbox for Livestock Diseases, available as Epitools at http://www.ausvet.com.au. A total of 1123 serum samples were collected from an administrative structure of 52 villages, 40 sub-districts and 15 districts. Serum samples were tested using commercially available antibody enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Illustration such as maps was produced using QGIS version 2.18 'Las Palmas. The mean national apparent prevalence of Johne's disease was found to be 2.31 (26/1123) (95% CI: 0.80-4.50) with an estimated true prevalence was found to be 8.00 (95% CI: 2.00-17.00). Trongsa district had the highest prevalence (12.96) followed by Zhemgang (4.34), Lhuntse (4.25), Sarpang (3.89), Bumthang (3.60), Trashigang (2.67) and Haa (2.63). Prevalence for all other districts was 2.00 or below. Seropositive samples were reported from all over the country with varying levels of sero-positivity. In the recent past many more cattle were imported from India to boost dairy production. Nevertheless, the wide distribution of seroreactive JD cattle all over the country is a concern for future control. Therefore, in future, a detailed study on the impact of cattle import with regard to disease incursion such as Johne's disease and other diseases should be undertaken.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bhutan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paratuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In veterinary medicine, rifaximin is primarily used in the treatment of dermatological diseases in all animal species, in therapy and prophylaxis of mastitis in cows and in the treatment of endometritis in cattle and horses. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of rifaximin on primary cell cultures from bovine endometrium in which inflammatory response was induced by Lipopolysaccaride (LPS) treatment. Epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from bovine endometrium and separately incubated for 24 h with 1 &#956;g mL[-1] LPS after rifaximin (10, 50 and 100 &#956;mol L[-1]) or dexamethasone (10 &#956;mol L[-1]) pre-treatment for 24 h. Supernatants were collected 24 h after LPS treatment and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 accumulation was measured by ELISA. Rifaximin (10, 50 and 100 &#956;mol L[-1]) dose dependently inhibited the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 and IL-8 in stromal cells, whereas in epithelial cells it was not possible to detect any accumulation of these interleukins. Rifaximin reduced IL-6 and IL-8 production, showing a potential anti-inflammatory effect that opens up to new possibilities for the use of this drug in uterine inflammatory diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Survival</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cells, Cultured</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endometrium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epithelial Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipopolysaccharides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rifaximin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate derived from the precursor glucosinolate, glucoraphanin (GFN), which is found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. Sulforaphane has been shown to suppress tumour growth by several mechanisms including inhibiting histone deacetylases. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed analysis of sulforaphane absorption following a single oral dose of a broccoli sprout supplement in normal dogs. A single dose of broccoli sprout supplement (with active myrosinase) was orally administered to 10 healthy adult dogs. Blood and urine samples were collected prior to dosing, and at various time points post-dosing. Plasma total SFN metabolite levels peaked at 4 h post-consumption and were cleared by 24 h post-consumption. Urinary SFN metabolites peaked at 4 h post-consumption, and remained detectable at 24 and 48 h post-supplement consumption. A trend for decrease in histone deacetylase activity was observed at 1 h post-consumption and a significant decrease was observed at 24 h post-consumption. The data presented herein indicate that oral SFN is absorbed in dogs, SFN metabolites are detectable in plasma and urine post-dosing, and SFN and its metabolites have some effect on histone deacetylase activity following a single dose.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brassica</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Histone Deacetylases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isothiocyanates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sulfoxides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The course of vincristine chemotherapy, the most effective and practical therapy, is affected by the immune status of the host. The aim was to investigate recombinant human interferon alpha-2a (rhIFN&#945;-2a) and vincristine for treatment of CTVT. A total of 21 female dogs were included. In group I (n = 9), vincristine (0.025 mg/kg, IV) was administered weekly. In group II (n = 6), dogs were injected intratumorally weekly with 1.5 million IU rhIFN&#945;-2a. In group III (n = 6), rhIFN&#945;-2a and vincristine were combined. No tumour regression was observed after three injections of rhIFN&#945;-2a in group II and weekly vincristine was administered. The number of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), mitotic figures and apoptotic cells were counted in subsequent incisional tumour biopsies. The Kaplan-Meier Method was used to analyse survival using complete tumour regression as the outcome and Breslow Test was used for comparison of survival curves. Differences in TILs, cell proliferation and apoptosis between groups were assessed by analysis of covariance. Complete regression was observed in all animals included. Mean duration of vincristine treatment for complete regression was shorter in group II (3.50 weeks, 95% CI, 3.06-3.94, P &lt; 0.05) and group III (3.17 weeks, 95% CI, 2.84-3.49, P &lt; 0.01) compared to group I (5.11 weeks, 95% CI, 4.42-5.80). Vincristine and rhIFN&#945;-2a combination increased TILs in CTVT biopsies compared to vincristine treatment (P = 0.017) and vincristine treatment after rhIFN&#945;-2a (P = 0.049). Vincristine treatment after rhIFN&#945;-2a (Group II; P &lt; 0.001) and rhIFN&#945;-2a and vincristine combination (Group III; P &lt; 0.001) decreased apoptosis. The results indicate that intratumoral rhIFN&#945;-2a treatment alone is not effective in CTVT. However, combination of rhIFN&#945;-2a and vincristine shortens the duration of treatment compared to vincristine therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Therapy, Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interferon alpha-2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Venereal Tumors, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vincristine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30168285</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter species in dogs and cats in Iran.</Title>	<Abstract>Campylobacter is considered the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world with C. jejuni being regarded as the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. A broad range of other Campylobacter species, including C. coli have also been implicated in human gastroenteritis. This study sought to isolate, characterize and assess the antibiogram of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli from faecal samples obtained from cats and dogs in Isfahan and Shahrekord cities in Iran. Faecal samples were collected from 100 pets comprising of 50 dogs and 50 cats from March 2015 to March 2016; incorporating the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Campylobacter spp. was isolated by culture, characterized by biochemical tests and confirmed by PCR-based assays. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, using Mueller Hinton agar. A total of 19 Campylobacter isolates among them two C. jejuni and one C. coli were recovered from dogs and cats' faecal samples. The prevalence rates of Campylobacter spp. were 16.0% (8 out of 50) in dogs and 22.0% (11 out of 50) in cats. The highest (4 out of 16, 25%) Campylobacter spp. prevalence among dogs was reported in autumn and the lowest (1 out of 11, 9.1%) in spring, while among the cats, the highest (4 out of 12, 33.3%) Campylobacter spp. prevalence was reported in summer and lowest (1 out of 11, 9.09%) in spring. Campylobacter spp. isolated from faecal samples obtained from cats and dogs exhibited the most frequent antimicrobial resistance against tetracycline at 81.8% and 87.5%, respectively, compared to all other antimicrobial agents. These results show a low prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in faecal samples obtained from pet dogs and cats in Shahrekord and Isfahan cities in Iran. Given the relatively low prevalence of the C. jejuni and C. coli in pet dogs and cats in Isfahan and Shahrekord cities, it can be assumed that their importance as reservoirs for infection in humans is likely to be limited to the studied cities, but should not be neglected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hot Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the frequency, location, characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of staphylococci isolated by the Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory between the years 2001 and 2014. All feline staphylococcal isolates were classified phenotypically. Isolates corresponding to known or possibly pathogenic species (Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA)) as well as Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) and non-speciated coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were further evaluated to determine antimicrobial resistance patterns. A total of 519 staphylococci were isolated. The largest percentage of isolates was CNS, representing 39.3% of the total, while SIG, SE, SA and non-speciated coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) represented 18.1%, 10.2%, 8.3% and 7.3%, respectively. Methicillin resistance (MR) was identified in 57.1% of SA and 20.5% of SIG. Resistance to 3 or more antimicrobial classes (multidrug resistance; MDR) was demonstrated in 54.5% of SA and 23.9% of SIG. The prevalence of MDR increased over time in both SIG and SA, while the prevalence of MR increased over time in SIG. An increase in mean antimicrobial resistance score over time was seen in SIG. This study demonstrates a high and increasing prevalence of MDR in SIG and SA, as well as increasing prevalence of MR in SIG isolated from cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Louisiana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The goal of this study was to perform an epidemiological analysis of FMD outbreaks reported to the Veterinary Epidemiology Center, Tripureshwor, Nepal during 2010-2015, in order to strengthen the National FMD Control Program. These current data were considered in the context of historical data on FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes detected in the country between 1965 and 2015. During 2010-2015, a total of 1333 livestock holdings reported FMD outbreaks in Nepal. On average, 71.2 animals were affected in each outbreak, with a case fatality rate of 3.6%. FMD was reported throughout the country, and the proportion of affected holdings was not significantly among eco-zones, regions, or species. The Hill eco-zone had the highest number of holdings affected (782), followed by Mountain (304), and Terai (247). When analysed by the developmental region, the Western (381) and Central (368) Developmental Regions had the highest numbers of holdings affected. Cattle were the most frequently affected species (39%), followed by buffalo (33%), and goats (19%). FMD occurred throughout the year, with peaks in winter (December/January) and in the pre-monsoon period (April/May). Between 1965 and 2015 FMDV serotype O had the highest prevalence (81%), followed by Asia-1 (11%), A (6%), and C (2%). Serotype C was not detected after 1996, and only serotype O was reported after 2011. These descriptive analyses provide critical landmarks to establish baselines, and document early progress of the ongoing Progressive Control Pathway of FMD (PCP-FMD) which could be useful in Nepal and other South Asian nations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot-and-Mouth Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nepal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In Bovidae, 22 different PAG genes (boPAGs) with a wide range of temporal and spatial expression- and glycosylation patterns have been reported to date. In this study we describe the mRNA expression patterns using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for selected modern (boPAG-1, -9, -21) and ancient bovine PAGs (boPAG-2, -8, -10, -11, -12) in cotyledonary tissue. The highest mean expression was detected in boPAG-8 and lowest in boPAG-10 (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, boPAG-8 and -11 were significantly greater expressed in early gestation compared with later pregnancy stages. The characterization of boPAG mRNA-expression levels gives important insights for further protein analyses which will be valuable information for the development of new pregnancy detection systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Regulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multigene Family</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placenta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Messenger</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcriptome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Up-Regulation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In contrast, the overproduction of angiogenic factors and enhanced angiogenesis are frequently observed in several types of tumours. Although there have been many reports on the correlation between tumour progression and angiogenesis in humans, little is known about tumour angiogenesis in canines. Hence, we attempted to clarify whether angiogenesis contributes to tumour progression in canines as well as humans. In this study, we investigated the expression of several angiogenesis-related genes, including CD34, VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie1, and Tie2, in 66 canine tumour tissues and in the normal tissues surrounding the tumours by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Our comparative analysis between canine tumour tissues and normal tissues revealed that several angiogenesis-related genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF-receptor genes, were significantly upregulated in canine tumour tissues when compared to the normal tissues. We also found that the angiopoietin (Ang)-1/Ang-2 gene expression ratio was lower in canine tumour tissues than in the normal tissues, suggesting less association between vascular endothelial cells and perivascular cells in the canine tumour tissues. Taken together, our results suggest that several angiogenesis-related genes may contribute to the malignant progression of canine tumours via tumour angiogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neovascularization, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcriptome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Up-Regulation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Imaging of ovaries is technically difficult; however, ovaries clamped at a subcutaneous site can more easily be monitored using ultrasound imaging. This study investigated the follicular development of canine ovaries stimulated by hormone treatment using ultrasound imaging of the ovaries clamped at a subcutaneous site. Oestrus was induced using subcutaneous administration of 500 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and 1000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (eCG/hCG). Five bitches were given 1000 IU hCG 11 days after eCG/hCG administration. Examinations with ovarian ultrasonography using a 7.5-MHz sector transducer, vaginal cytology, and assays of serum oestrogen and progesterone were performed daily until 20 days after eCG/hCG administration. Serosanguineous vaginal discharges and vaginal cytology of two of the bitches were observed. New follicular growth (&gt;1.0 mm in diameter) was observed in all bitches from 2 to 8 days after eCG/hCG administration. The mean diameter of follicles and maximum numbers of follicles per ovary ranged from 2.8 to 5.5 mm and 4 to 16, respectively. The elevation in oestrogen concentrations after eCG/hCG administration was observed in all bitches, and elevation in progesterone concentration (&gt;2 ng mL[-1]) was observed in three bitches. However, no follicles ovulated until 9 days after hCG administration. In conclusion, although the number of examined bitches were limited, follicular growth in ovaries clamped at a subcutaneous site can be monitored using ultrasound imaging. Ovarian ultrasonography showed that eCG/hCG administration induced new follicular growth and hCG administration induced increases in oestrogen concentrations but not ovulation by hCG administration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chorionic Gonadotropin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovarian Follicle</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Preimplantation factor (PIF) is secreted by viable embryos, including human, mouse and cattle, and is essential for maternal immune-tolerance without immune-suppression by modulating inflammation. This preliminary study aimed to test whether PIF exerts inflammatory-modulating properties upon equine endometrium challenged with Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using endometrial explant culture. Follicular (n = 3), luteal (n = 4), anoestrous (n = 4) and transitional (n = 4) stage endometrial explants were established and cultured in triplicate in either serum-free medium alone (control) or medium with; 50 or 100 nmol/L synthetic PIF (sPIF); 3 &#956;g/mL LPS; LPS and 50 or 100 nmol/L sPIF; or scrambled PIF (PIFscr; same amino acid composition arranged in a different order). Media samples were collected at 24 and 72 h, representing acute and chronic inflammatory response. Radioimmunoassay determined Prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF2&#945;) as an inflammatory marker. The only significant observation was the abrogation of PGF2&#945; response to LPS challenge by 100 nmol/L PIF for follicular stage tissue, 24 h after treatment. Further studies are therefore, warranted to realise PIF potential in managing PMIE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dinoprost</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endometrium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tissue Culture Techniques</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the possibility of undeclared ingredients jeopardizes the efficacious use of OTC options for medical purposes. The objective was to determine the presence of undeclared ingredients in OTC canine dry diets marketed as limited or single protein source diets. Twenty-one OTC adult canine diets marketed as limited or single protein source diets were purchased. Multiplex PCR was used to screen for DNA of 10 mammalian species with species-specific primers that anneal to regions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The presence of DNA from one or more species not declared on the label was identified in all 21 diets: cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), sheep (Ovis sp.), goat (Capra hircus) and bison (Bison bison). Twenty diets were positive for the declared protein source and one diet was negative for the declared species. Cat (Felis catus), dog (Canis sp.), horse (Equus sp.), mouse (Mus musculus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus) DNA was not identified in any samples. The presence of undeclared mammal species in OTC canine dry diets marketed as having limited or single protein source ingredients may complicate AFR diagnosis and treatment. However, PCR can detect a miniscule amount of DNA which might not be clinically significant, because the amount needed to elicit a response is unknown. Quantification of the contamination was not determined in this study, precluding discrimination of intentional adulteration from unavoidable cross-contamination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Species Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two members of the Simbu serogroup, Akabane and Shuni viruses, have been isolated from congenitally malformed ruminants in Israel. A recent serosurvey revealed that Israeli ruminants have been exposed to several additional Simbu viruses, including Shamonda and Sathuperi that seems to be circulating in Israel. In April 2017, an apparently healthy one-month-old male calf was transferred to the Kimron Veterinary Institute. A few days later, the calf was reported to be slow to respond to its surroundings and was not able to feed on its own. Blindness was observed upon clinical examination. RNA of the small, medium and large segments of Simbu serogroup viruses were amplified and sequenced from the testis tissues and from the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During post-mortem examination, hydranencephaly was defined. Phylogenetic analysis of all three segments of Simbu serogroup viruses showed that the sequences detected in the Israeli calf were virtually identical to Peaton virus (PEAV). PEAV was also detected in two pools of Culicoides imicola trapped at two different locations in Israel. This is the first genomic detection of PEAV outside Australia and Japan. These results are of epidemiological significance, as they demonstrate that PEAV is circulating in Israel and affects cattle. Consequently, these results are also of relevance to a potential spread of Simbu serogroup viruses into Europe.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bunyaviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydranencephaly</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Simbu virus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Gliomas, which are common in dogs and also represent the majority of fatal brain tumours in humans, can be amenable to chemotherapy with temozolomide. Biopolymer microcylinders conjugated with temozolomide and gadolinium were implanted into partially resected tumours of four client-owned dogs with gliomas. All four dogs presented with generalized seizures and had mild to no neurologic deficits at the time of craniotomy. All dogs underwent craniotomy for implantation of the microcylinders into partially resected gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme {n = 1} or oligodendroglioma {n = 3}). All dogs recovered well from the craniotomy and implantation procedure. This novel procedure appears to be feasible and tolerated in tumour-bearing dogs. A future controlled clinical study can now aim to evaluate the microcylinder implantation for long-term efficacy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Implants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temozolomide</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how veterinarians' attire affected owners' impressions and trust in the small animal specialty medicine setting. A questionnaire based study conducted during a 2-month period at an urban based small animal private practice specialty hospital. Respondents completed a written survey after reviewing pictures of the same male and female veterinarian in five different dress styles. Respondents were asked for their preference for male and female veterinarian attire in different clinical scenarios and whether it would affect their willingness to discuss sensitive issues. Two hundred and thirty-eight questionnaires were completed during the study period with 76.1% of respondents being female. Female respondents did not have a preference to how a male or female veterinarian was attired with the attire examples provided. However, male respondents tended to have fairly equal response rates between no preference and preferring a male veterinarian to be in either clinical or professional attire. Male owners either had no preference or preferred their male veterinarian to be attired in clinical or professional attire and had no preference or preferred their female veterinarian to be clinical attire. Most respondents do not feel it is necessary for a veterinarian to wear a white coat or neck ties and most do not feel it is inappropriate for a veterinarian to wear blue jeans, have coloured hair, or have visible tattoos.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Attitude</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clothing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In September 2016, the Republic of Niger declared the first RVF outbreak in the northern region of Tahoua near the Malian border. This study describes the outbreak and reports the results of serological and molecular investigations of the human and animal samples collected. Serum samples from both human and animal suspected cases have been confirmed at the Centre de Recherche M&#233;dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES) and the Laboratoire Centrale d'Elevage (LABOCEL) public health and animal reference laboratories, respectively. Techniques for biological confirmation were real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phylogenetic trees were established after genetic sequencing of the small and medium segments of the RVF virus (RVFV) genome. Out of the 399 human samples collected, 17 (4.3%) were confirmed positive for RVFV. Overall, 33 (8.3%) deaths occurred out of which five (29%) were among the 17 confirmed cases. Regarding animals, 45 samples were tested, three of which were RT-PCR positive and 24 were IgG positive. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the Niger strains clustered with Senegal 2013 and Mauritania 2015 RVFV strains. This first outbreak of RVF was very challenging for public and animal health laboratories in Niger. Besides resulting in human deaths, important loss of cattle has been reported. Therefore, vigilance has to be strengthened emphasising vector control strategies and active surveillance among animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adolescent</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Child</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Child, Preschool</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Niger</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rift Valley Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rift Valley fever virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of the study was to investigate the sero-prevalence and serotype distribution of BTV in Libya. During 2015-2016, a total of 826 serum samples were collected from domestic ruminants in Libya. All sera were assayed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (c-ELISA). C-Elisa-positive samples (43.3%; 173/400) were further analyzed by virus neutralization assay to identify BTV serotypes and determine the antibody titre of positive samples. An overall BTV sero-prevalence was 48.4% (95% CI: 45.0%-51.8%). Neutralizing antibodies were detected against the following BTV serotypes namely: BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4, BTV-9 and BTV-26. While BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-9 circulation was unsurprising as they have been responsible of the last year outbreaks in Northern African Countries, the detection of BTV-3 and BTV-26 was definitely new and concerning for the animal health of the countries facing the Mediterranean Basin. It is crucial that European and Northern African authorities collaborate in organizing common surveillance programmes to early detect novel strains or emerging serotypes in order to set up proper preventive measures, and, in case, develop specific vaccines and plan coordinated vaccination campaigns.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bluetongue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bluetongue virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Libya</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We aimed to investigate the presence of common zoonotic bacterial pathogens in Irrawaddy squirrel in the southeast part of Bangladesh. A total of 27 rectal and 27 oro-nasal swabs were collected from 27 healthy wild Irrawaddy squirrels. Four common zoonotic bacteria were isolated following routine laboratory procedures, and were identified based on colony morphology, and biochemical and staining properties. The pathogenic potential of the identified bacteria was confirmed by detection of virulence genes by PCR. All isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test against seven antibiotics from six generic groups which are commonly used in human and veterinary medicine in Bangladesh. The prevalence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and Staphylococcus spp. was 44.4% (95% CI, 32.0-57.6), 13% (95% CI, 6.1-24.7), 44.4% (95% CI, 32.0-57.6), and 72.2% (95% CI, 59.0-82.5), respectively. We identified potential zoonotic virulence genes in all of these four bacterial species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of several multidrug resistant bacterial strains in squirrels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in Bangladesh of the detection of antibiotic resistant zoonotic bacteria in Irrawaddy squirrels. The findings underpin the role of Irrawaddy squirrel as a source of pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria, consequently, fruit rejected because of squirrel consumption and squirrel-bites deserve more concern than previously.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodent Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sciuridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>30549234</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Tetanus outbreak in a sheep flock due to ear tagging.</Title>	<Abstract>Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, infectious neuromuscular disease in all farmed mammals caused by Clostridium tetani. The disease is sporadic but outbreaks of tetanus have been described, as a result of wound contaminated with spores of C. tetani, which sporulates to the vegetative form and produce toxins. The present study reports an outbreak of tetanus in a sheep flock, shortly after ear tagging. Three sheep from a large flock (with a population of 1000 sheep) were presented with signs of: convulsion, limb stiffness, incoordination and trismus ("lock jaw"). There were wounds and scabs in most livestock where ear tags had been attached 1 week prior. Clinical examination revealed tachycardia, dyspnoea with dilated nostrils, mild fever, erected ear pinnae, teeth grinding, mild bloat, muscles rigidity, prolapse of third eyelid and anxiety. According to the history stated by the owner, the case fatality rate of the disease from the beginning was 50% during the outbreak. Necropsy did not reveal any significant finding. Gram-positive bacilli with terminal spores representing C. tetani were isolated in anaerobic cultures which were taken from ear wounds. Procaine penicillin G was administrated at 20 000 IU/kg BW for 5 days, but antiglobulin was not available to treat affected animals. Mortality significantly declined one day after onset of treatment. In this report, the organism was probably introduced by contaminated instruments which were used for ear tagging of sheep. Wound exudation and adhesion following rubbing, created a favourable anaerobic condition for the spores to germinate with production of neurotoxin. Vaccination can protect animals against tetanus, but it does not preclude the need to apply standard hygienic principles when performing management procedures causing wounds. In pasture holding system, many pathogens are present in environment, so tetanus should be considered important in farm animals, because of its high fatality rate and the long course of convalescence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridium tetani</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tetanus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

As there is a high possibility that no clinical signs of infection are observed in the host, an accurate and sensitive method is needed for quarantine on numerous live pigs especially for international pig trade. In this study, a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay specifically for PCV3 was established without cross-reactions with other non-targeted pig viruses. The sensitivity of the current approach is about 1.5 &#215; 10[1 ] copies &#956;L[-1] plasmid DNA while the sensitivity of the conventional PCR is about 1.5 &#215; 10[2] copies &#956;L[-1] plasmid DNA. Further, this assay was applied in the retrospective quarantine on serum samples of 601 commercial live boars imported to China from the United States, France and the United Kingdom from 2011 to 2017. The results revealed that PCV3 could be detected positive in the commercial boars imported from the United States and the above-mentioned western European countries and phylogenetic study also revealed that viral isolates were grouped with some isolates from Korea and the United States. Our study suggested that PCV3 may be prevalent globally since 2011.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Commerce</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quarantine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thus, detection of M. bovis-infected badgers may be required for the purposes of surveillance and monitoring of disease levels in infected populations. Current serological assays to detect M. bovis infection in live badgers, while rapid and inexpensive, show limited diagnostic sensitivity. Here we describe and evaluate new ELISA platforms for the recognition of the P22 multiprotein complex derived from the purified protein derivative (PPD) of M. bovis. The recognition of IgG against P22 multiprotein complex derived from PPD-B was tested by ELISA in the serum of badgers from the UK, Ireland and Spain. TB infection in the badgers was indicated by the presence of M. bovis in tissues by culture and histology at post-mortem examination and TB-free status was established by repeated negativity in the interferon &#947; release assay (IGRA). In experimentally infected badgers, humoral antibody responses against P22 developed within 45 days post-infection. The ELISA tests showed estimated sensitivity levels of 74-82% in experimentally and naturally infected badgers with specificities ranging from 75% to 100% depending on the badger population tested. The P22 multi-antigen based ELISAs provide a sensitive and specific test platform for improved tuberculosis surveillance in badgers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Reservoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ireland</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mustelidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium bovis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United Kingdom</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recent data suggest that ruminants in Corsica area reservoir for several Anaplasmataceae species. The purpose of our study was to determine whether Ehrlichia species could be detected in ticks collected in Corsican ruminants by using molecular methods. Ticks were collected in northern Corsica: (i) in May 2016 from sheep bred in one farm located in a 5000-inhabitants village and (ii) from cattle in June and July 2016 in a slaughterhouse. There sheep and cattle whole skin was inspected and ticks were collected manually. A total of 647 ticks was collected in northern Corsica during this study: 556 (86%) belonged to the Rhipicephalus bursa species and 91 (14%) to Hyalomma marginatum. The 91 H. marginatum ticks were organized in 27 pools, of which one (3.7%) was found positive for the presence of E. minasensis; this pool consisted of six ticks collected from a cow bred and raised northwestern Corsica. Ehrlichial DNA was not detected in R. bursa ticks. The 16S rRNA and groEL gene sequences of Ehrlichia detected in the H. marginatum pool showed 100% (303/303 bp) and 99.8% (555/556) of nucleotide identity with E. minasensis, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the highest closeness with E. minasensis UFMG-EV genotype than to any other E. canis strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. minasensis outside of Brazil, Ethiopia and Canada. This identification of E. minasensis in H. marginatum merits to be further investigated and pleads for translational studies addressing the potential impact of vector-borne diseases of human and veterinary impact through large-scale research and surveillance programmes in Corsica.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>France</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genes, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ixodidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, whole blood stimulation with either PMA/I or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to assess the effect of multiple drugs (azathioprine, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, leflunomide and prednisone) after a 7-day treatment course on production of cytokines measured with a multiplex assay in healthy dogs (n = 4 for each treatment). Interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) were significantly activated by PMA/I stimulation and IL-6, IL-10 and TNF&#945; by LPS stimulation, in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs. After ciclosporin treatment, IL-10, IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; production was significantly reduced after stimulation with PMA/I compared to pre-treatment. After prednisone treatment, TNF&#945; production was significantly reduced after stimulation with PMA/I or LPS compared to pre-treatment. No significant change was observed after treatment with azathioprine, leflunomide or mycophenolate. This methodology may be useful to monitor dogs not only treated with ciclosporin, but also with prednisone or a combination of both. Further studies are needed to assess the use of this assay in a clinical setting.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Azathioprine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interferon-gamma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interleukins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ionomycin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leflunomide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipopolysaccharides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycophenolic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) play an important role in human society, and canine perineal anatomy is important for maintaining dogs' reproductive health for successful breeding and a wide variety of pathologies. Here, we investigate homologies between male and female perineal structure, identifying structures based on common function, anatomical relationships and attachments. In this investigation we dissected 21 male and female large-breed dogs. We find broad structural homologies between male and female dogs related to erection, micturition and defecation, including muscles, fasciae and erectile tissue. Using these homologies will help anatomists and clinicians interpret the anatomical organization of the perineum, a notoriously difficult area of anatomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genitalia, Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genitalia, Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perineum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this paper, we describe an abortion outbreak in goats caused by Chlamydia abortus. Seventy out of 400 goats aborted. Placental smears stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain showed many chlamydia-like bodies within trophoblasts. One stillborn fetus was necropsied and the placenta was examined. No gross lesions were seen in the fetus, but the inter-cotyledonary areas of the placenta were thickened and covered by fibrino-suppurative exudate. The most consistent microscopic finding was found in the placenta and consisted of fibrinoid necrotic vasculitis, with mixed inflammatory infiltration in the tunica media. Immunohistochemistry of the placenta was positive for Chlamydia spp. The results of polymerase chain reaction targeting 23S rRNA gene performed on placenta were positive for Chlamydia spp. An analysis of 417 amplified nucleotide sequences revealed 99% identity to those of C. abortus pm225 (GenBank AJ005617) and pm112 (GenBank AJ005613) isolates.

Relevance for public health.</Title>	<Abstract>Halicephalobus gingivalis is a small saprophytic rhabditid nematode, represented only by females with a typical rhabditoid oesophagus and one egg in the uterus, capable of infecting vertebrates. This opportunistic parasite present in the soil, manure and decaying humus, is thought to penetrate through previous injuries to the mouth, eyes and skin of horses and migrate to various organs. The brain is one such organ, where the females lay their eggs, leading to malacia and causing a sudden onset of neurological signs, such as anorexia, ataxia, urinary incontinence, blindness, decreased menace and tonal reflexes, tremors and aggressiveness. The disease is invariably fatal whenever brain lesions are present, and the diagnosis usually achieved only post-mortem. The present work aims to describe the first case of infection by H. gingivalis ever reported in Portugal. An 8-year old warmblood horse presented with an 8-day history of progressive blindness involving the left eye, initially with normal pupillary reflexes, advancing to bilateral blindness and increasing deterioration in clinical condition. After euthanasia, the animal was submitted for necropsy. Organ samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for routine histopathology. A large mass was found in the left kidney corresponding to fibrous tissue heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells and numerous nematodes. In the brain, multiple, bilateral and asymmetrical foci of malacia containing several rhabditoid nematodes, larvae and zygotes, and high numbers of inflammatory cells were found. The nematodes were identified as H. gingivalis. The clinical history, necropsy and histological findings presented constitute a typical case of H. gingivalis infection in a horse, never previously described in Portugal to the authors' best knowledge. Humans can be infected by contact with contaminated manure, which makes this nematode a public health concern, especially for people living and/or working in close proximity to horses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Larva</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portugal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Public Health</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhabditida</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhabditida Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A case of phosphine toxicosis in local, free range chickens is reported. Fourteen dead chickens (age &#8805;6 months old) were presented to the veterinary clinic for necropsy. The history revealed that the chickens were normally fed with guinea corn grains, but were suspected to have been fed boiled rice laced with poison. The clinical signs observed were ruffled feathers, somnolence, anorexia and high mortality. The disease ran a 2-day course with mortality pattern of four chickens the first day, six overnight and 14 the following day. Necropsy findings showed generalized vascular congestion and haemorrhage in the lungs and visceral organs, with the crop and gizzard filled with guinea corn and rice grains and greenish-yellow faecal material in the intestinal lumen. The presence of widespread congestion and petechial haemorrhages on visceral organs with the microscopic pulmonary congestion, and diffuse intraparabronchial presence of air sac macrophages, strongly suggested an acute toxic cause of death. Chemical tests on the crop contents of the dead chickens were positive for phosphine gas. This report will contribute to a better understanding of the clinical signs and lesions presented in cases of acute phosphide rodenticide exposure in domestic chickens, with a brief review of the forensic literature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodenticides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Studies have shown that mutations in melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) gene are related to litter size as well as the ovulation rate in sheep and goats. In this study, polymorphism of two loci in MTNR1A melatonin receptor gene was studied in order to survey their relationship with litter size in Markhoz goats. PCR primers were employed to mask polymorphisms of MTNR1A in 150 does by PCR-RFLP method. After DNA extraction, the PCR-RFLP was performed using Ecol31I and HpaI restriction enzymes. Results showed that these loci were not polymorphic. These results show that the fecundity of Markhoz goats is not linked to MTNR1A.

Improving the nutrition of cows by providing supplementary feeds during periods of pasture or nutrient deficit is necessary for improved productivity. This study was conducted to determine the effect of feed supplementation during the post-partum period on the metabolic status and reproductive performance of 40 grazing Sanga and Friesian &#215; Sanga cows. Twenty out of a total of 40 cows (10 Sanga and 10 Friesian &#215; Sanga cows) were supplemented with 2.5 kg of concentrate per day for 16 weeks after calving. Parameters measured include daily milk yield, concentration of blood metabolites, resumption of ovarian activity and conception. Supplemented cows had higher partial milk yield than their non-supplemented counterparts (2.07 vs. 1.60 kg/day; P &lt; 0.001). Sanga cows had lower milk yield than the Friesian &#215; Sanga crossbreds (1.61 vs. 2.05 kg/day; P &lt; 0.01). Supplemented cows had higher mean total protein (86.7 vs. 81.3 g/L; P = 0.007) and globulin (53.0 vs. 47.7; P = 0.014) concentrations than non-supplemented cows. Sanga cows had higher glucose (P = 0.027), total protein (P &lt; 0.001) and globulin (P &lt; 0.001) but lower triglyceride (P = 0.003) and progesterone (P = 0.023) concentrations than Friesian &#215; Sanga cows. Supplemented cows had less proportion not cycling (20 vs. 55%; P = 0.022) and less days open (95.8 vs. 106 days; P = 0.032) than non-supplemented cows. The Friesian &#215; Sanga cows had higher progesterone concentrations at first progesterone rise (3.34 vs. 1.32 ng/mL; P = 0.032) and shorter interval from calving to conception (96.7 vs. 106 days; P = 0.042).

Clinically, it is associated with absence of symptoms or with different clinical syndromes. It has been reported in different countries of America, Europe and Asia. Last year, in Colombia, some farms have reported symptoms similar to those caused by PCV2. Samples were taken from two farms located in the centre of the country, and the presence of PCV3 was determined by PCR in two samples, one from a pool of sera and another from mesenteric lymph node. The strains were fully sequenced (GenBank accession numbers MH327784 and MH327785) and classified into subgroups a1 and a2. According to this classification and its analysis, strain a2 is located within the group called "Linker" that may be evolving towards group "b". In addition to the above, the two Colombian strains were compared with 104 strains reported in the GenBank database. The phylogenetic tree obtained grouped according to the classification of subgroups a1, a2, b1 and b2. It was found that subgroups a1 and a2 were well grouped when comparing whole genomes, but the same was not observed with the strains of group "b". In the latter, no subgroups were evidenced when comparing complete genomes. It is suggested that a new classification of PCV3 subgroups should be proposed, based on whole genome sequences. This is the first report of PCV3 in Colombia and its complete genome sequence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colombia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) has been described in American Bulldogs and is caused by a variant in the NIPAL4 gene encoding for the ICHTHYIN protein. So far, this variant has not been described in other breeds. A 1.5-year-old female pedigreed American Bully was referred for generalized scaling and bad coat quality since adoption at 8 weeks of age. Clinical examination, cytological and histopathological examination, and DNA testing were performed. Clinical examination revealed a generalized scaling; cytological evaluation using impression with acetate tapes showed a secondary Malassezia dermatitis. Histopathological examination revealed a moderate to marked, diffuse, compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with the formation of large scales. Few Malassezia were observed in the stratum corneum associated with minimal mixed perivascular inflammation and moderate epidermal hyperplasia. DNA testing of the dog revealed that he carries two defective alleles of the NIPAL4 gene previously described in the American Bulldog. We performed a commercially available breed detection test which, although not specifically testing for "American Bully" signatures, revealed a high probability of American Bulldog DNA signature within the past three generations. Topical treatment using a combination of keratolytic and keratomodulator shampoo, emollient and moisturizers spray and antimicrobial wipes achieved a marked clinical improvement after only 1 month. Continuous topical treatment was necessary to maintain clinical improvement. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of the deleterious NIPAL4 variant in an American Bully as well as the first description of clinical management and follow-up of ARCI in this breed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Base Sequence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epidermis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genes, Recessive</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ichthyosiform Erythroderma, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptors, Cell Surface</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Deletion</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study was designed to verify if VEGFC treatment improves lymphatic vascularization in a time-dependent manner in mouse hindlimb (HL) after resection of the inguinal lymph node. Lymphatic vascular density (Vv) and length (Lv) were evaluated by stereology after immunohistochemistry. The control Group (CG) was not manipulated but received saline instead of VEGFC treatment. The surgery Group (SG) had the left inguinal lymph node resected but did not received VEGFC treatment. VEGFC Treated Group (TG) had the node resected and received VEGFC treatment. VEGFC and VEGFR3 local expression were assessed by qPCR. There was an effect of time over Vv and Lv in the SG and significant difference between CG and SG in the regions studied (proximal, medium and distal regions) of the left HL (LHL). The Lv showed significant difference between CG and SG only in the medium region. The Vv and the Lv for TG were higher than the other groups. VEGFC and VEGFR3 gene expression presented time effect in all regions of the LHL for SG and TG. Both VEGFC and VEGFR3 gene expression presented significant difference between CG and SG, between SG and TG and between CG and TG. This study showed significant decrease in lymphatic vascularization in the left hindlimb of mice after surgical removal of the inguinal lymph node and adjacent lymphatic vessels. Exogenous VEGFC could recover lymphatic vascularization through stimulating neolymphangiogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymph Node Excision</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphangiogenesis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphatic Vessels</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred BALB C</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to evaluate evidence-based, individualised diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for management of dogs with chronic diarrhoea, where financial constraints dictate a budget-limited approach and where more expensive approaches are deferred until simple affordable protocols are unsuccessful. Twenty-two client-owned dogs with chronic (minimum 2 weeks duration) untreated small, large or mixed small/large bowel diarrhoea were enrolled in a budget-limited step-wise management protocol (maximum expenditure $300 over 6 weeks), with diagnostic testing and therapeutic trials managed in an individualised and evidence-based fashion. Success was defined as complete resolution of diarrhoea for a minimum of 1 month. Dogs that failed to respond to a budget-limited protocol were then enrolled for complete, referral-level management. Four dogs exited the project early (one death due to caval syndrome, three lost to follow-up). Thirteen out of the remaining 18 dogs had complete resolution of diarrhoea utilising a budget-limited approach (success rate 72.2%, confidence intervals 46.5-90.3%) and five dogs were moved on to a referral-level investigation, with complete resolution of diarrhoea in four out of five. Seventeen out of the 18 dogs therefore responded to a protocol based on a budget-limited approach followed by extensive investigation only if needed, for an overall success rate of 94.4% (CI 72.7-99.9%). Comprehensive investigation of chronic diarrhoea can be deferred while simple affordable diagnostics and therapeutic trials are conducted in stable canine patients and, often, an extensive management approach will be unnecessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diarrhea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Management</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Program Evaluation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In particular, BT can be a debilitating disease in sheep causing serious trade and socio-economic consequences at both local and global levels. Across Australia, a sentinel cattle herd surveillance program monitors the BTV activity. Prior to 2014, BTV-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -15, -16, -20, -21 and -23 had been isolated in Australia, but no bluetongue disease has occurred in a commercial Australian flock. We routinely use a combination of serology, virus isolation, RT-PCR and next generation and conventional nucleotide sequencing technologies to detect and phylogenetically characterize incursions of novel BTV strains into Australia. Screening of Northern Territory virus isolates in 2015 revealed BTV-5, a serotype new to Australia. We derived the complete genome of this isolate and determined its phylogenetic relationship with exotic BTV-5 isolates. Gene segments 2, 6, 7 and 10 exhibited a close relationship with the South African prototype isolate RSArrrr/5. This was the first Australian isolation of a Western topotype of segment 10. Serological surveillance data highlighted the antigenic cross-reactivity between BTV-5 and BTV-9. Phylogenetic investigation of segments 2 and 6 of these serotypes confirmed their unconventional relationships within the BTV serogroup. Our results further highlighted a need for a revision of the current serologically based system for BTV strain differentiation and importantly, implied a potential for genome segments of pathogenic Western BTV strains to rapidly enter Southeast Asia. This emphasized a need for continued high-level surveillance of vectors and viruses at strategic locations in the north of Australia The expansion of routine characterization and classification of BTV to a whole genome approach is recommended, to better monitor the presence and level of establishment of novel Western topotype segments within the Australian episystem.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bluetongue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bluetongue virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epidemiological Monitoring</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Northern Territory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Western Australia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study aimed at detecting and genetically characterizing Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species in ixodid ticks and their animal hosts from the West Bank, Palestine. A total of 723 ixodid ticks belonging to three genera (Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, Haemaphysalis) were collected from dogs, sheep, goats and camels. In addition, 189 blood samples were collected from dogs, sheep, camels, horses and a goat from the West Bank, Palestine. All tick and blood samples were investigated for the presence of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia targeting a 345 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene followed by sequence analysis. The infection rate of Anaplasma spp. in ticks was 6.5% (47/723). Anaplasma platys was identified in 28% (13/47) of them. Whereas, based on a partial sequence (851 bp) of msp4 gene, 38% (18/47) were identified as A. ovis. The species of the remaining 16 positive samples (16/47, 34%) could not be identified. Simultaneously, the infection rate of Ehrlichia spp. in the ticks was 0.6% (4/723). Three of which were E. canis and one was Ehrlichia spp. The infection rate of A. platys in dogs' blood samples was 10% (13/135), while it was 1.5% (2/135) for E. canis. The infection rate of Anaplasma in sheep blood samples was 40% (19/47), out of which 26% (5/19) were caused by A. ovis as revealed by msp4-PCR. Implementation of purely-spatial analysis by saTScan for all cases of Anaplasma revealed two statistically significant clusters in two districts; Tubas town and Majdal-Bani-Fadil village on the western hills of the Jordan Valley. Most cases of Anaplasma (83%) were from rural areas where life cycle components (vector, host and reservoir) abundantly interact. This study is the first in Palestine to reveal the presence of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia in ticks, dogs and sheep providing crucial platform for future epidemiological surveys and control strategies in the country and region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anaplasma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Reservoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ixodidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle East</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nymph</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study is to help the surgeon make informed clinical decisions about margins when confronted with a small intestinal mass. Twenty-seven canine small intestinal tumours were histologically diagnosed and then had further histological assessment at every centimeter from the edge of the palpable tumour to the surgical margin in oral, aboral and mesenteric directions. In all 10 carcinomas a 3 cm tissue margin in oral, aboral and mesenteric directions would have resulted in complete tumour resection. In all 11 sarcomas a 2 cm tissue margin in oral, aboral and mesenteric directions would have resulted in complete tumour resection. Five of the six intestinal lymphomas would have required tissue margins of 4 cm or more for complete resection. Of the 21 non-lymphoma tumours assessed in this study, complete resection was achieved in all 21 (100%) with tissue margins at 3 cm from the palpable edge of the mass, 20 (95%) with tissue margins at 2 cm from the palpable edge of the mass, and 16 (76%) with tissue margins at 1 cm from the palpable edge of the mass in oral and aboral directions. All non-lymphoma canine small intestinal masses will be completely resected when tissue margins are 3 cm from the palpable edge of the mass in oral and aboral directions after fixation in formalin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestine, Small</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Margins of Excision</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoma</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30779313</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't</Type>	<Title>Financial impact of an outbreak of clinically diagnosed blackleg - a case study from Lao PDR.</Title>	<Abstract>Blackleg (BL) is an acute to peracute highly fatal infectious disease of mainly large ruminants characterised by lesions of myonecrosis caused by Clostridium chauvoei, usually presenting as a sudden onset of sporadic mortalities. In Southeast Asia, 'BL' is considered a cause of occasional outbreaks of a subacute febrile illness, although there are few published reports available. Investigation of a major outbreak of clinically diagnosed BL occurring in large ruminants (cattle and buffalo) in three neighbouring villages in central Laos in mid-2017, was conducted to determine the financial impacts of BL on smallholder livelihoods. Owners of BL-infected large ruminants in the three affected villages were interviewed (n = 27) and financial losses including losses due to mortality, morbidity and costs of treatments, were determined. The reports of clinical signs of subcutaneous swelling with palpable crepitus in febrile animals were considered consistent with a diagnosis of BL. The outbreak occurred in 47 of a total 449 households with large ruminants across the three villages, affecting 147 of a total population of 3505 'at risk' large ruminants with 71 deaths reported. At the household level, the mean morbidity and mortality rates were 5 &#177; 4(95% CI: 3-6) and 3 &#177; 2(95% CI: 1-4) heads per household, respectively. The estimated financial losses due to BL per affected household was USD 822 &#177; 692(95% CI: 518-1125), being 122% of their annual household income from large ruminant sales. The comparison between the estimated losses due to BL per village and cost of annual BL vaccination programmes, indicated a potential economic benefit of USD3.09 and USD12.37 for every dollar invested in the vaccination programme, if BL outbreaks occur every 20 and 5 years, respectively. This study indicates that clinically diagnosed BL can cause significant losses to smallholder households, and requires Lao animal health authorities to consider vaccination interventions to prevent losses from re-emergence of BL in the known endemically affected areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridium Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridium chauvoei</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laos</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In order to investigate the possibility of mice used to study the infection of PCV3, commercially sourced Balb/C and ICR mice were screened for PCV3 infection. Blood samples were collected from 20 mice (10 each of Balb/c and ICR), DNA was extracted, and subjected to PCR with PCV3 specific primers. We found all 20 serum samples tested positive for PCV3 DNA. From four mice, the complete genomes of PCV3 were amplified and sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The results showed that the amplified genome was 2000 bp, and sequence comparison showed that the homology of the complete genome and ORF2 gene with those of porcine PCV3 are 97.9%-98.8% and 96.9%-98.3%, respectively. Amino acids alignment results showed that the Cap protein of the mouse PCV3 isolates share 90.7%-96.3% amino acid homology with that of the references strains derived from pigs. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORF2 sequences showed that all PCV3 strains clustered together and were clearly separate from other circovirus species. We detected PCV3 in experimental mice in China for the first time, which is an opportunity to use mice to study the infection of PCV3 and a potential hazard to swine industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred BALB C</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred ICR</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodent Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-five pairs of testes were collected from mature Ghezel rams from Tabriz slaughterhouse. The two glands were compared for their size, weight and activity rate. Weight, length, width and thickness were measured. Then, paraffinized blocks were prepared by routine histological techniques and sections were stained by the haematoxylin-eosin method. Five 6 &#956;m sections were prepared from each paraffinized block and 50 seminiferous tubules (STs) were analysed in each section for tubular differential index (TDI) and spermiogenesis index (SPI). TDI and SPI were compared between the paired left and right testes. Weight, length and thickness of left testes were significantly higher than in right testes (P &lt; 0.05).

This study was designed to evaluate graded levels of neem seed oil on growth performance of broiler chickens. A total of 400-day-old chicks were randomly allocated to five experimental treatment groups. Experimental rations consisted of supplementing basal diet (R0[-]) with 1 g antibiotic (R0 +), 15, 20 and 25 g neem seed oil/kg of feed. Data were recorded on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and serum biochemical parameters. Result revealed that feeding broiler chicks with 25 g of neem oil/kg of feed resulted in a marked (P &lt; 0.05) decreased in feed intake as compared to the other treatments in the starter phase. The average live body weight and the weight gain decreased with increasing level of neem oil in the ration. Supplementation of poultry feed with graded levels of neem oil has no marked (P &gt; 0.05) effect on carcass yield and relative weight of organs except for liver weight which significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased with the highest dose of neem oil. Serum content in total proteins, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine were not significantly (P &gt; 0.05) affected by the graded levels of neem oil. LDL-cholesterol significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased with diets supplemented 20 g of neem oil/kg while triglycerides significantly increased with the highest doses of oil (20 and 25 g/kg) as compared to the negative and positive control rations. In conclusion, feeding broilers with Azadirachta indica seed oil has no beneficial effect on growth performance but may lead to the production of low-cholesterol chicken meat as demand by health-conscious consumers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Azadirachta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycerides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seeds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Terpenes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weight Gain</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In veterinary medicine, no such guideline has been established or investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the interval from the decision to perform a caesarean section and the delivery of the neonates and fetal mortality at the time of surgery. One hundred and fifty canine caesarean sections were evaluated retrospectively. Caesarean cases were dichotomized to those that had at least one perinatal death and cases where all puppies survived. Factors that increased the likelihood of at least one perinatal death at caesarean section were: cases that presented as an emergency caesarean section, the dam presenting with a fetus in the vaginal canal, the dam not having a history of previous caesareans sections, and being multiparous. Even though there was no association of DDI with likelihood of having perinatal death, timing related factors that increased the likelihood of having at least one perinatal death at caesarean section were: cases where total anaesthesia time was longer than 2 h; time from induction to start of surgery was longer than 45 min and surgical time longer than 75 min. In conclusion, time is a factor in the success of canine caesarean sections and further research is needed to better define the optimal decision to delivery time in canine caesarean sections in order to optimize fetal survival and hospital protocol success rates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Decision Making</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fetal Mortality</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eleven dogs had a baseline complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, platelet count, serum chemistry profile, PT, aPTT, and TEG performed. Each dog was then administered approximately 1.0 mg kg[-1] of RIV orally once daily for 1 week and the CBC, fibrinogen, platelet count, serum chemistry profile, PT, aPTT, and TEG was re-evaluated. Any side effects attributed to RIV were noted at this time. One dog was excluded due to identification of a macrocytic thrombocytopenia on pre-treatment blood work. The remaining 10 enrolled dogs completed the study. Dogs received a median dose of 1.02 mg kg[-1] (range 0.94-1.17 mg kg[-1]) of RIV once daily and was associated with a significant increase in pulse, packed cell volume, total solids, platelet count, fibrinogen and a significant decrease in mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. There was no significant change in PT, aPTT or any TEG parameters. The RIV appeared well tolerated with one dog having one episode of vomiting on day 4 but otherwise no other side effects were identified clinically or on recheck blood work. The results of this study suggests that RIV at a dose of 1 mg kg[-1] orally once daily is safe and well tolerated but does not cause a significant prolongation of PT, aPTT or TEG parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Factor Xa Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Partial Thromboplastin Time</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prothrombin Time</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Values</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rivaroxaban</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombelastography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of the study was to improve the quality of canine chilled sperm during storage time. We therefore, evaluated the effects of eight treatments with different levels of soybean lecithin concentration (1, 3 and 5%) and egg yolk (20%) in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender on chilled canine sperm quality during 10 days of storage. The sperm motility was analysed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), whereas plasma membrane integrity, acrosome membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential parameters were determined using a fluorescent staining combination of propidium iodide (PI), Hoechst 33342 (H342), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA) and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) by confocal laser scanning microscope. The results showed that egg yolk was found to be better than soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender for maintaining the quality of chilled canine sperm within 10 days of storage (P &lt; 0.05). Although egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose extender could maintain the motility better than other extenders, egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender was the highest in intact plasma membrane, intact acrosome membrane and high mitochondrial membrane potential (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the sperm quality of soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender was lower than that of soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose extender, and soybean lecithin 1% was greater than soybean lecithin 3% and 5% in plasma membrane integrity, acrosome membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, soybean lecithin cannot replace egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extenders, and egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender is superior to other extenders in chilling canine sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryoprotective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Decision Making, Computer-Assisted</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Egg Yolk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lecithins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Preservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycine max</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Outbreaks of human cases of Q fever have been reported in Australia and the Netherlands, which was linked to abortions in goat and sheep farms. In Ghana, information on Q fever in both livestock and humans is scanty. This study sought to determine the seroprevalence of Q fever in livestock in the Tongu area of the Volta region of Ghana. It was a cross sectional study with blood sampled from 204 cattle, 158 sheep and 100 goats. An indirect ELISA test was performed to detect Q fever antibodies in the serum of livestock. A total of 20 farms were sampled across the municipalities and an overall prevalence of Q fever was 21.6%. Specie-specific prevalence was 28.4% (45/158) for sheep, 21.7% (45/204) for cattle and 10% (10/100) for goats. Abortions were reported on all the farms sampled and most farmers lived in close proximity to the farms sampled. Q fever is prevalent in the North Tongu area and requires the attention of the veterinary and health authorities, using the One- Health approach in order to control its occurrence and save lives.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ghana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, there is a lack of evidence to substantiate resection margin recommendations for these tumours. The aim of this study was to add knowledge concerning resection margins for discrete intestinal masses in cats. Thirty confirmed feline intestinal tumours removed at veterinary centres across the UK from March 2017 to March 2018 underwent histological assessment at the palpable edge of the intestinal tumour and then at every 1 cm increment to the surgeon-cut tissue border in oral, aboral and mesenteric directions. Histological margin recommendations were developed for carcinoma and lymphoma tumour types and non-lymphoma intestinal tumours collectively. Seventeen intestinal lymphomas, nine carcinomas, two sarcomas and two mast cell tumours were evaluated in this study. Seven of the nine intestinal carcinomas would have been completely removed with histological margins of 4 cm in oral and aboral directions. Both sarcomas and one mast cell tumour would have been removed in their entirety with 4 cm histological margins in oral and aboral directions. There was extensive and varied microscopic invasion of intestinal tissue away from discrete intestinal lymphomas in the majority of the cases in this study. There is increasing evidence in veterinary as well as human literature supporting the role of surgical resection in the treatment of discrete intestinal lymphoma.

Emergencies are characterized as chemotherapy-induced, paraneoplastic syndromes, or directly related to the neoplasm. Prompt identification with treatment of these emergencies can prolong survival and improve quality of life, even in the setting of terminal illness. This review aims to educate the reader on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and treatment of some of these emergencies, and to review the current veterinary literature to help educate veterinarians in primary and tertiary facilities to know how to diagnose and treat these serious conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergencies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medical Oncology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>30920176</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't</Type>	<Title>Risk mapping and eco-anthropogenic assessment of anthrax in the upper Zambezi basin.</Title>	<Abstract>In Zambia, anthrax has emerged as a serious disease decimating humans, livestock and wildlife with devastating effects on eco-tourism resulting in the destabilization of major pristine wildlife sanctuaries. Consequently, the thrust of this study was to establish the spatial distribution of anthrax and determine ecological drivers of its recurrence, maintenance and epidemiological linkage to anthropogenic activities. Environmental and biological samples were collected within the livestock production and conservation areas (n = 80). Each sample was serially tested for Bacillus anthracis positivity through blood agar culture and Gram stain technique, and then confirmation by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR). Questionnaires (n = 113) were conducted at independently distinct villages in terms of space and time. Most respondents showed that animals that died from anthrax were not properly disposed off. More likely than not, poverty being the main driver for anthrax carcass dressing and meat distribution contributed to environmental contamination with anthrax spores in areas where the animals subsequently died resulting in further environmental contamination, which is the major source of primary infection for livestock and wildlife. From the samples, 15 pure isolates of anthrax were obtained which were spatially distributed across four districts. Twelve, biologically plausible variables were found to be highly significant on multivariable logistic regression analysis model for questionnaires which included herd size (odds = 10.46; P = 0.005; CI 8.8-16), carcass disposal method (odds = 6.9; P = 0.001; CI = 3.4-9.8), access to veterinary services (odds = 10.87; P = 0.004; CI = 4.8-15.9) and management system (odds = 2.57; P = 0.001; CI = 1.3-7.5). In summary, the majority (78.7%) of anthrax outbreaks were observed in areas with low veterinary services (&#967;[2] = 8.6162, P = 0.013) within the newly created districts of Nalolo, Mwandi and Luampa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthrax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacillus anthracis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Geographic Mapping</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Assessment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spatial Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zambia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In total, 1063 cattle and buffalo belonging to 420 herds in seven districts were sampled. The Rose Bengal test (RBT), indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) were used for the serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis on all the serum samples. The associations between herd-and animal-level risk factors and seropositivity were investigated using logistic regression analyses. In addition, herd management practice scores, created to quantify the number of management practices undertaken that pose a risk for Brucella transmission, were calculated and compared between seropositive and negative herds within each district. Overall herd and animal prevalence were estimated to be 16.2% (95% CI, 13-20%) and 8.7% (95% CI, 7.2-10.6%), respectively, across all districts sampled. Herds with a history of last trimester abortion were found to be more likely to be positive than herds without such history (OR = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.09-3.89), providing validation of our findings and identifying that clinical disease is occurring in this region. It was also identified that herds with five to eight buffalo (OR = 3.80, 95% CI, 1.69-8.49), and those with more than eight buffalo (OR = 3.81, 95% CI, 1.51-9.58) were more likely to be positive for Brucella than those with less (one to two and three to four) buffaloes present in the herd. The presence of other domestic animals at the farm and purchasing animals in last year were found to have no association with seropositivity. The findings of this study support the need for the development of targeted intervention strategies specific to the disease status of each district.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Agriculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Mannan oligosaccharides and &#946;-glucans, yeast cell wall fractions (YCW), have been reported to beneficially influence broiler performance and health. Two differently produced yeast cell wall fractions derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evaluated in this study using two different supplementation strategies offered to full-term broilers. The birds were placed in floor pens on used pine-shaving litter to increase potential microbial stress and mimic industry practice. The study utilized a three-phase feeding program with a 1- to 21-day starter, 21- to 35-day grower and 35- to 42-day finisher phases. Five dietary treatments were compared in this study. The experimental diets consisted of a control basal broiler diet; or the basal diet supplemented with the two differently produced fractions of YCW. The YCW products were supplemented at a constant 250 ppm or a decreasing concentration program (500, 250, 125 ppm) throughout the three feeding phases. Birds fed diets supplemented with either YCW products at any inclusion regimen demonstrated higher (P &lt; 0.05) body weight (BW) in all three phases than control birds. The difference in final 42-day BW of the YCW treatments (3041 g) averaged 165 g higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the control group. For all YCW treatments, productivity index was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the grower (418) and finisher phase (441) versus control birds (389 grower and 415 finisher). These results suggested that both YCW fractions prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae can improve broiler performance when added at either a constant rate (250 ppm) or at a decreasing rate from 500 ppm for the starter to 125 ppm for the finisher phase.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Wall</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mannans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oligosaccharides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prebiotics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Glucans</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Yupingfeng polysaccharides (YP) supplementation on growth performance and expression of SGLT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5 in Qingyuan partridge chicken. Experiment 1: a total of 540 chickens were randomly allocated to five groups with six replication. Dietary treatments were: (1) CON (control group), basal diet; (2) T1, CON + 0.5 g kg[-1] YP; (3) T2, CON + 1 g kg[-1] YP; (4) T3, CON + 2 g kg[-1] YP; (5) T4, CON + 4 g kg[-1] YP. Experiment 2, a total of 162 were randomly allocated to three groups with three replication. Dietary treatments were: (1) CON, basal diet; (2) T1, CON + 0.5 g kg[-1] YP; (3) T2, CON + 1 g kg[-1] YP. From days 1 to 14 and overall, chicken fed T1 diet had higher ADG. On day 42, there was increased villus height of jejunum in T1 group. On days 14 and 28, there was decreased villus height of duodenum and jejunum in T2 group. In duodenum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 21, 35 and 42), GLUT2 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21 and 28) was increased with YP supplementation. In jejunum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35), GLUT2 (days 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) was increased with YP supplementation. In ileum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 7, 21, 35 and 42), GLUT2 (days 7, 14, 21 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) was increased with YP supplementation.

This study however, investigated an outbreak of PPR and GTP in a mixed flock of indigenous sheep and goats in Kanam, North Central Nigeria. A total of nine sera and seven tissues (lungs, spleen, scab and skin) samples were collected and analysed in the laboratory using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for PPR antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of PPR virus (PPRV) and GTP virus (GTPV). Gene fragments of the nucleoprotein of PPRV and the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) of GTPV were amplified and sequenced to confirm the presence of the causative viruses. Serologically, antibodies to PPRV were detected in all (9/9) sera collected. GTPV and PPRV was detected in corresponding samples (42.8% n = 3/7) of the scab/skin samples collected by both PCR and RT-PCR technique. The phylogenetic analysis of PPRV revealed that the virus belongs to lineage IV and clustered with viruses from Gabon and Cameroon. Similarly, the GTPV also clustered with other sequences from Burkina Faso and Yemen. The positive cELISA, RT-PCR and PCR results from samples collected from the same animals confirmed co-infection of PPR and GTP in this mixed flock of sheep and goats. This is the first report of concurrent infection of PPR and GTP in mixed flock of sheep and goats in Nigeria. Our findings underscore the need for farmers to vaccinate their flock to control spread and economic losses as result of these diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Capripoxvirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coinfection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-Petits-Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poxviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this study was to compare follicular growth, timing of ovulation and serum progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in dairy heifers treated with modified 4- or 5-day CoSynch + CIDR protocols (CIDR for 4 or 5 days, PGF2 &#945; at CIDR removal and GnRH + TAI 72 h later). Twelve cycling Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to either the 4- or 5-day Co-Synch+CIDR (n = 6/treatment) to receive an intravaginal insert CIDR[&#174;] containing 1.38 g of P4 for 4 or 5 days, respectively. At CIDR removal, 25 mg of PGF2 &#945; was injected IM; 72 h after CIDR removal, heifers received 100 &#956;g of GnRH IM and timed artificial insemination (TAI). Follicular growth and timing of ovulation were assessed using transrectal ultrasonography. Blood samples were collected at the time of CIDR insertion and at frequent time points after CIDR removal for determination of P4 (at TAI), E2 (every 12 h) and LH (every 6 h during the first and second day and every 2 h on the third day). Heifers in the 4-day group had smaller follicles from CIDR insert removal to ovulation compared with heifers in the 5-day treatment. Five of six heifers (83.3%) in the 4-day treatment ovulated at 90-96 h post CIDR insert removal, whereas most heifers in the 5-day treatment (4/6; 66.6%) ovulated at 84-90 h post CIDR insert withdrawal. Heifers in the 5-day treatment reached greater peak LH concentration between 48 and 72 h after CIDR insert removal and lesser E2 concentration at TAI than heifers in the 4-day treatment. In conclusion, heifers in the 4-day treatment had smaller follicular diameter at 0, 30, 36, 42 and 48 h after CIDR insert removal, longer interval from CIDR insert removal to ovulation, greater E2 concentrations at TAI, and lesser peak LH concentration than heifers in the 5-day treatment. These results represent a baseline for further studies to determine if prolonging the interval to TAI by 6 h in the 4-day CoSynch+CIDR would improve pregnancy risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estradiol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus Synchronization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insemination, Artificial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Luteinizing Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovarian Follicle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

With over two million Muslims making Hajj, each Hajj, more than 1.2 million heads of cattle: sheep, goats and camels are slaughtered. Over 16 000 abattoir workers work around the clock to sacrifice and process the cattle in keeping with Islamic law and public health guidelines. Because of their proximity to high densities of cattle and cattle meat, Makkah's abattoir workers are at risk of zoonosis. This was a longitudinal study aimed at determining the risk of some zoonotic diseases among male permanent abattoir workers during Hajj. Specifically, seroprevalence of antigens for Brucella, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever (AHF) and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) were determined, among the study participants. An enrolment questionnaire, and a follow-up questionnaire, with provision of 10 mL blood for testing 2 days before intense Hajj animal exposure, up to 20 days after intense animal exposure and between 30 and 42 days after Hajj butchering exposures. While working with livestock, study participants were interrogated on hand hygiene and personal protection. Eighty male permanent abattoir workers participated in the study. Majority, 96.25% (n = 77) declared washing their hands with soap and water, most 98.75% (n = 79) never used eye protection, few occupational workers dressed in personal protective clothing or footwear. All workers tested negative for CCHF and RVF, one was positive for AHF and six for Brucella. The risk of some zoonotic infections like Brucella and AHF is low among permanent occupational workers in the slaughtering house in Makkah during Hajj 2013. No serological evidence for CCHF and RVF viruses, even though workers showed low compliance with use of personnel protective equipment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abattoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antigens, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antigens, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Longitudinal Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Occupational Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Assessment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Saudi Arabia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These behaviours resemble those reported for professional and non-clinical curriculum areas, which are important for employability and resilience in veterinary practice. Students with a 'growth mindset' to learning are more persistent when faced with challenges and actively seek more demanding tasks. They also demonstrate higher levels of psychological well-being. The objectives of this study were to explore whether variation in veterinary students' mindset to learning exists across different curriculum areas, and to identify whether students' backgrounds influence their learning mindset. The mindsets of veterinary students at a UK veterinary school were measured using an adapted version of the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale. The survey was constructed to compare mindset in clinical reasoning, professional reasoning (incorporating ethics and critical thinking), communication skills and reflection. More students demonstrated a growth mindset to communication skills (59%), reflection (84%) and clinical reasoning (83%) than to professional reasoning (34%). There were more students with a fixed mindset to professional reasoning (10%) than in other areas (0-5%). Students' background (international or non-traditional university access) did not appear to influence mindset to learning. Disengagement from professional studies curricula may be a consequence of students lacking a growth mindset in professional reasoning. Curriculum interventions that encourage engagement and the development of a growth mindset to learning non-clinical competences may be beneficial.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Achievement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Culture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Curriculum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Education, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intelligence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Learning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Students, Medical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thinking</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Prior to the collection of nationwide clinical records, we downloaded the data from the digital accounting systems of two veterinary teaching hospitals in Japan, and the prescriptions of antineoplastic agents were surveyed for a 5-year period from 2009 to 2013. The ratio of the number of patients prescribed antineoplastic agents to the total number of prescriptions was &lt;5% at both hospitals, and &gt;80% of those patients were dogs. The overall number of prescriptions included more oral rather than injectable formations, whereas among antineoplastic agents, injectable formulations were prescribed more frequently at both hospitals. The most frequently prescribed agents were almost identical at both hospitals: platinum compounds, such as carboplatin and cisplatin (CDDP), vincristine and doxorubicin. The most frequently prescribed product combined with CDDP was doxorubicin at Hospital A. Antiemetic agents combined with CDDP included dexamethasone, ondansetron and metoclopramide, but these antiemetic agents were combined fewer than 10 times among 197 CDDP prescriptions. The prescription history, including the number of prescriptions, dosing intervals and combined medications, was provided by the survey. Although the present database consisted of data from two hospitals, our results indicate that a broad analysis can be conducted using integrated data from multiple hospitals and practices for further cohort studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Teaching</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Despite ruminants are the most important reservoir, STEC human infections have also been attributed to pigs. We examined for the presence of STEC in 234 samples of swine caecal content collected during the year 2015 at Italian abattoirs in the framework of the harmonized monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (Decision 2013/652/EU). The presence of stx genes was detected in 122 (52.1%) samples, which were subsequently subjected to STEC isolation and characterization. The analysis of the 66 isolated STEC strains showed that the majority of the isolates (74.2%) possessed the stx2a gene subtype, in a few cases (16.7%) in combination with stx2b or stx2c. Only 25.8% of isolates possessed the stx2e subtype, typical of swine-adapted STEC. None of the isolates possessed the intimin-coding eae gene and the majority of them did not belong to serogroups commonly associated with human infections. The results of this study suggest that pigs can be considered as potential reservoir of certain STEC types.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abattoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cecum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Reservoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Shiga Toxin 2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Different equid herpesviruses, EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-4 and EHV5 are regularly detected among horse populations. In Egypt, monitoring is sporadic but EHV-1 or EHV-4 have been reported to circulate in the horse population. However, there is a lack of reports related to infection and health status of horses, likely due to the absence of regular diagnostic procedures. In the current study, the circulation of four infectious equid herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-4 and EHV-5) among different Arabian horse populations and donkeys residing the same farm was monitored. Different samples were collected and DNA was extracted and subjected to quantitative (q)-PCR to detect the four equid herpesviruses using specific primers and probes. Antibody titres against EHV-1 and EHV-4 were tested using virus neutralization test and type-specific ELISA. The results showed that EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-4 and EHV-5 are endemic and can be a continuous threat for horses in the absence of vaccination programs and frequent virus reactivation. There is an urgent need for introduction of active regular surveillance measures to investigate the presence of different equid herpesviruses, and other equine viral pathogens, in various horse populations around Egypt and to establish a standardized cataloguing of equine health status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Egypt</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesviridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The multifactorial causes of SFP are discussed in the areas of genetics, feeding, husbandry, stable climate and management. Several studies on the influence of manipulable material on the incidence of SFP in different environments and housing systems have been performed. This review presents current knowledge on the effects of litter and additional enrichment elements on the occurrence of SFP in pullets and laying hens. Because SFP is associated with foraging and feed intake behaviour, the provision of manipulable material in the husbandry environment is an approach that is intended to reduce the occurrence of SFP by adequate exercise of these behaviours. As shown in the literature, the positive effect of enrichment and litter substrate on SFP in a low-complexity cage environment is evident. On the other hand, consistent results have not been reported on the influence of additional enrichment material in housing systems with litter substrate, which represent the most common type of husbandry in Northwestern Europe. Thus, further research is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aggression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Welfare</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feathers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feeding Behavior</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Housing, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the sodium and phosphorus contents in wet pet foods, and compare it to daily requirements for both species. Twenty-five commercial wet foods for adult animals were evaluated, 13 for dogs and 12 for cats. The analyses' results were compared to the European Pet Food Industry Federation (FEDIAF 2018) recommendations. All foods contained phosphorus and sodium amounts above minimum requirements. Three wet foods for dogs exceeded the safe upper limit for phosphorus, and four wet foods for dogs and three for cats exceeded 3.75 g of sodium/1,000 kcal metabolizable energy (ME), considered safe by FEDIAF. No studies were found at the present time evaluating whether higher sodium levels are safe for dogs and cats; however, consumption of high phosphorus diets has been associated with adverse effects on renal function parameters. Therefore, more studies are necessary to investigate the health implications of phosphorus and sodium concentrations observed in some foods evaluated in this research.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutritive Value</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphorus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sodium</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These interactions may lead to impaired dosing and consequently decrease absorption. Moreover, feed present in gastrointestinal tract may interact with antibiotic and alter pharmacokinetic parameters. In the present study, dissolution profiles of an oxytetracycline veterinary formulation were assessed in purified, soft and hard water. Furthermore, oxytetracycline absolute bioavailability, after oral administration of the drug dissolved in soft or hard water, was evaluated in fed and fasted piglets. A maximum dissolution of 86% and 80% was obtained in soft and hard water, respectively, while in purified water dissolution was complete. Results from in vivo study reconfirmed oxytetracycline's very low oral bioavailability. The greatest values were attained when antibiotic was dissolved in soft water and in fasted animals. Statistically significant lower absolute bioavailability was achieved when hard water was used and/or animals were fed. Moreover, Cmax attained in all treatments was lower than MIC90 of most important swine pathogens. For these reasons, the oral use of OTC formulations, that have demonstrated low oral bioavailability, should be avoided to treat systemic diseases in pigs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biological Availability</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fasting</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxytetracycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Water</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Alternative treatments of canine osteoarthritis would be desirable and, recently nutraceuticals, have been proposed for this purpose. Twenty cross breed adult dogs affected by osteoarthritis were enrolled and equally divided into two groups (control vs. experimental). The nutritional supplement (Dynamopet srl, Verone, Italy) was administered for 90 days to the dogs of the experimental group in order to evaluate its metabolic and locomotor effects. All the clinical signs (lameness, pain on manipulation and palpation, range of motion and joint swelling) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) improved during the trial as regards the experimental group. This group showed a significantly lower joint score than the control group (mean value 7.40 vs. 3.80). With regard to haematology, the mean corpuscular volume resulted significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in the experimental group, i.e. alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides values decreased and were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower than the control one, thus suggesting an improvement in bone remodelling and lipid metabolism. A decrease in the reactive oxygen metabolites and an increase in the biological antioxidant potential demonstrated an improvement in oxidative stress during the trial in the experimental group compare to the control group. Interleukins 6 decreased in the experimental group, while interleukins 10 resulted in the opposite trend. Moreover, the administration of up to 3 months of the studied supplement was well tolerated in the dogs and caused no adverse effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Seven hundred and forty-nine serum samples were collected from humans (n = 545), dogs (n = 33), donkeys (n = 20), goats (n = 52), sheep (n = 43) and N'Dama cattle (n = 56), all originated from Dielmo and Ndiop villages. All samples were tested for different serovars of pathogenic Leptospira species by the microscopic agglutination test. Considering titres &#8805; 1:100, 7.7% [CI 95:5.5 to 9.9] on the 545 human blood samples tested and 42.2% [CI95 :35.4 to 48.9] on the 204 animal blood samples tested were found to be positive to one or more serovars. The results obtained indicate that the Australis serogroup is the most prevalent serogroup in human (67.3%) and cattle (27.3%). Serogroup Icterohaemorhagiae is the most frequent serogroup in goat (55.6%) and donkey (37.5%). Canicola (23.4%), Icterohaemorhagiae (21.1%) and Australis (12.5%) serogroups are the most prevalent serogroups in dogs. This study shows that diverse Leptospira serovars occur in a wide range of wild and domestic mammal species, as well as in humans in Senegal. However, further studies are needed to better understand the complexity of Leptospira epidemiology in Africa, identify the reservoirs of different serogroups and estimate its impact on livestock. Understanding the multi-host epidemiology of leptospirosis is essential to control and prevent the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adolescent</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged, 80 and over</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Child</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Child, Preschool</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospirosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neglected Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Senegal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Young Adult</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It has been suggested that livestock farms could be a source origin of AMR, and some wild animals that inhabit this area may play an important role in the spread of AMR in the natural environment. The prevalence of AMR in Escherichia coli was examined from Okinawa rails (Gallirallus okinawae), an endemic bird in Okinawa Main Island, Japan. Forty-eight faecal samples of wild Okinawa rails were collected from around a livestock farm area (LA), near human settlements, in which a population of the Okinawa rail had newly inhabited for feeding, and a forest area (FA), their natural habitat. Among 16 E. coli-positive faecal samples collected around LA, 11/16 (69%) showed antimicrobial resistance and five multiple drug resistance patterns were identified. However, among 15 E. coli-positive faecal samples from FA, 3/15 (20%) showed antimicrobial resistance, and three multiple drug resistance patterns were identified. These results indicate that the endangered Okinawa rail may also play an important role as a potential vector for the spread of AMR in the natural environment. To maintain ecological health, it is imperative that in situ/ex situ conservation projects that include translocation plans for endangered species are aware of these data.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endangered Species</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The immunosuppression of CM probably favoured the opportunistic behaviour of N. asiatica. Despite the therapeutic measures, the animal died, mainly due to respiratory distress. The association of methods to improve early diagnosis, therapy procedures and prognosis of canine nocardiosis is discussed, as well as the close relationship between pets and their owners, which may favour the transmission of pathogens such as Nocardia from pets-to-humans, which poses an emerging public health issue.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brazil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coinfection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper Virus, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nocardia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nocardia Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pleuropneumonia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The present investigation was done to assess the prevalence and antibiotic resistance pattern of A. baumannii isolated from different types of raw meat samples. One hundred and ninety-four raw meat samples were collected and cultured for A. baumannii isolates. Culture-positive bacteria were also approved using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique. The disc diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Out of 194 raw meat samples, 39 (20.10%) were positive for A. baumannii isolates. Ovine raw meat was the most commonly contaminated samples (32.14%). All of the culture-positive A. baumannii isolates were also approved using the LAMP assay. A. baumannii isolates harboured the highest prevalence of resistance against gentamicin (87.17%), tetracycline (79.48%), erythromycin (74.35%), azithromycin (66.66%), ciprofloxacin (58.97%), trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (56.41%) and rifampin (51.28%). The lowest prevalence of resistance was found against imipenem (17.94%) and chloramphenicol (28.20%). Raw bovine, ovine, caprine, camel and poultry meat samples were considered as the important sources of isolates resistant to some of the categories of antimicrobials used to treat infections caused by A. baumannii. Further studies are required to find the exact role of resistant A. baumannii isolates in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance to human population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acinetobacter Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Acinetobacter baumannii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkeys</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>31634982</PMID>	<Type>Evaluation Study</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Sales data as a measure of antibiotics usage: Concepts, examples and discussion of influencing factors.</Title>	<Abstract>Monitoring and surveillance of antimicrobial usage in animals is a public health concern and different methods are currently discussed widely in public, science and politics. The objective of the paper is to present the available methods of monitoring and to discuss possible differences in the assessment of the antibiotics treatment. Sales data are expressed as the average amount of substance per animal or kg live weight (e.g. population-corrected unit, PCU). The number of Defined Daily Doses (nDDDvet) is calculated by extrapolating sales data with average animal weights and defined drug doses to a number of treatments theoretically applied to animals. In contrast, the number of Used Daily Doses (nUDDvet) displays the actual number of treatments which have been applied. As sales data are relatively easily obtained, they are frequently used. However, their results are influenced by the composition of the population and by the dose of the substances. As both may vary strongly between countries, direct comparison of sales data between countries may be misleading. The concept of analysing sales data is shown by exemplarily using the methods in the ESVAC report 2015. The presentation of usage data in terms of nDDDvet or of nUDDvet increases the comparability of the data from different countries or time periods. Furthermore, fluoroquinolones and third-/fourth-generation cephalosporins which, among other substances, bare a potential risk for human health, are used at low doses. Hence, their use contributes to a sales reduction while contrasting the guidelines of prudent use. nDDDvet or nUDDvet have the ability to better reflect the treatment frequency and thus to better link antibiotics use to public health concerns. Quantification of antibiotics should assist to focus on prudent use of antimicrobials to reduce the burden of resistant bacteria and, thus, enhance public health, animal health and animal welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Commerce</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Utilization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Europe</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Mutations in the KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (KIT) gene are common molecular abnormalities involved in mast cell tumorigenesis. KIT mutations often occur in dog, cat and human neoplastic mast cells and result in altered Kit protein structure and function. In dogs, certain KIT mutations are associated with more malignant and lethal disease. In contrast, KIT mutations in feline and human mast cell neoplasms are not correlated with prognosis, but are of value in diagnosis and treatment planning in humans. KIT genetic abnormalities have not been well investigated in other species, although aberrant cytoplasmic Kit protein staining detected in neoplasms of the ferret, horse and cow resembles aberrant Kit staining patterns detected in neoplastic mast cells of dogs, cats and humans. Mutations within KIT are classified as either regulatory-type or enzymatic pocket-type mutations according to their location within the KIT Proto-Oncogene. Mutations within the enzymatic pocket domain confer tumour resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, knowledge of tumour KIT mutation status adds valuable information for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The use of TKIs in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics has opened a new treatment avenue for patients unresponsive to existing drugs. This review highlights the similarities and differences of mast cell neoplasia in mammals with a special focus on the involvement of KIT in the canine and feline forms in comparison to human mast cell neoplasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Mast Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proto-Oncogene Mas</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study aimed to determine the genotype of Balantidium isolated from Eurasian wild boars in Bushehr province, Southwestern Iran. Twenty-five faecal samples, originating from 25 wild boars captivated in our previous study, were processed. DNA was extracted from the faecal samples and PCR-amplified, targeting an ITS1-5.8s-rRNA-ITS2 region of Balantidium genome. PCR product was purified from the gel, and sequenced. BLAST analysis was performed in order to compare our isolates with other previously reported ones. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, using MegaX software, to find out the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates. With PCR it was possible to detect Balantidium DNA in the faecal samples of 13 out of 25 (52%) of the wild boars. BLAST analysis of seven isolates revealed that the isolates belong to the newly introduced genus Neobalantidium coli. Sequences of three isolates were deposited in the GenBank. Moreover, molecular analysis revealed six areas of nucleotide differences within the isolates and nine areas of difference between the sequences obtained in this study and those available in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences of isolates of this study have up to 2.2% dissimilarity from those published in the GenBank. The findings of this study, for the first time, revealed that some of the isolates of Balantidium originating from wild boars in Southwestern Iran belonged to the N. coli.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Balantidiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Balantidium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The standard bacteriological method was used to isolate and identify E. coli, and then multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) was performed to determine virulence genes in E. coli. Among the 300 isolates, 166 (55.3&#65285;) harboured at least one virulence gene. Among the 166 isolates, 155 (93.4&#65285;) contained toxin-related genes. For enterotoxin genes, EAST1 (58/166, 34.9&#65285;) and LT-I (45/166, 27.1&#65285;) were the most common, followed by STa (32/166, 19.3&#65285;) and STb (21/166, 12.7&#65285;); for pathogenicity island (PAI) genes, irp2 (49/166, 29.5&#65285;) was the most dominant, followed by eae (48/166, 28.9&#65285;); for Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC)-associated toxin genes, Stx2e and hlyA genes were observed in 19 (19/166, 11.4&#65285;) and three strains (3/166, 1.8&#65285;) respectively. In addition, of the 166 isolates, 95 (95/166, 57.2&#65285;) contained adhesin genes, and AIDA-I (33/166, 19.9&#65285;) was the most common, followed by paa (27/166, 16.3&#65285;), F5 (K99) (20/166, 12.0&#65285;), F18 (15/166, 9.0&#65285;) and F41 (12/166, 7.2&#65285;).

Since implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) is known to reduce the risk of disease transmission, the objective of this study was to describe the pig farming management system as well as the biosecurity practices on pig farms in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Therefore, 97 farms were investigated using a face-to-face interview-based questionnaire. Biosecurity practices were divided in three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation. The results revealed that the majority of farms were extensive (73.22%), farrow-to-finish farms (59.79%) and essentially raising crossed-bred (72.75%). The most practiced BM regarding 'isolation' were as follows: maintenance of the minimum distance between farms (56.06%) and dispatching of animals of same age in the same room (97.16%); for 'traffic control', the measures included the following: assignment of specific tools and equipment (96.86%) to a specific piggery; concerning 'sanitation', daily cleaning (97.06%), as well as using disinfectants (89.13%) were mostly implemented. The measures less implemented for 'isolation' included fencing (11.83%), compliance with the all-in all-out principle (10.11%), use of specific clothing (6.03%) and quarantine (7.69%); for 'traffic control', the less adopted measures comprised visitor hands washed before animal handling (11.65%), respect of linear flow principle (13.52%). Concerning 'sanitation', these measures included functional footbath (29.90%), processing of drinking water (27.84%) and cleanout (18.14%). The biosecurity level was low, intermediate and high for 73.71, 21.55 and 4.73% of farms, respectively. This low level suggests that ASF and other diseases are likely to remain endemic. The most important measures of concern and to improve are as follows: not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barn; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cameroon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Housing, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sanitation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In all, 480 male broiler chicks of 1-day old were assigned in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 2 &#215; 5 (plant oil sources [soybean and rapeseed oils] and antioxidant sources [vitamin E, Thyme, Rosemary and Satureja essential oils] furthermore control treatment without antioxidant). The results indicated that at 1-42 d of age, growth performance and carcass yield of birds were not influenced by dietary plant oils and antioxidant supplementations. Dietary Thyme essential oil (300 mg/kg) resulted in an increase in crude protein digestibility and birds fed on diets without antioxidant showed increase in the apparent metabolizable energy (p &lt; .01). Birds receiving the combination of soybean oil with Rosemary essential oil had lowest malondialdehyde concentration in comparison to birds receiving other treatments (p &lt; .05) in the drumstick meat. Also, birds receiving the combination of soybean oil with vitamin E had lowest malondialdehyde concentration in comparison to birds receiving other treatments (p &lt; .05) in the breast meat. The results indicated that treatments did not influence water holding capacity of meat.

Foot and mouth disease outbreak investigation and follow-up studies were undertaken to identify the causative serotype, determine the morbidity and mortality, and estimate the economic impact of the outbreaks in selected districts of Northwest Ethiopia. The serotype of FMD virus involved in the outbreaks was identified by antigen detection ELISA from clinical samples. Morbidity, mortality and economic impact of the outbreaks were assessed based on data collected from 738 smallholder farmers in a mixed crop-livestock (MCL) production system and from five dairy farms in the commercial dairy production system. The outbreaks were confirmed to be due to FMD virus serotype O. The animal level morbidity in clinically affected cattle herds was 68.1% for MCL production system and 54.5% for commercial dairy farms. The mortality in cattle in the MCL system was 0.4% and no mortality was recorded in the commercial dairy farms. The animal level morbidity in sheep and goats in the infected flocks was 35.7% but no mortality was seen in these species. The herd/flock level morbidity of FMD in outbreak affected kebeles of MCL system was 57.2% for cattle and 8% for sheep and goats. The economic losses due to milk loss, draught power loss, mortality and treatment cost were on average USD 34 (interquartile range: 9.4-44.4) per affected herd in the MCL system and this was statistically significantly lower than the USD 459.1 (interquartile range: 400.0-486.2) per affected farm in the commercial dairy farms (p &lt; .05).

FF is composed of blood plasma constituents which cross the blood follicular barrier and the secretory components of granulosa and theca cells. Moreover, it has been shown recently that follicular cells have the ability to synthesize bile acids (BAs). BAs are present in several fluids of mammals especially in bile, blood and urine. FF is an essential impacting factor on the oocyte quality and therefore resulting embryos. To achieve a better understanding of this subject, the presence and concentration of BAs were measured in fluid collected from bovine follicles, categorized according to their size, throughout two entire oestrus cycles and compared to those in blood and urine. The body fluids were collected during the same examination procedure and in total samples from four heifers were obtained. A broad spectrum of 11 BA derivatives was measured applying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The simultaneous and direct quantification of BAs in different body fluids of cattle are reported. Within the follicular fluid, blood and urine, cholic acid and glycocholic acid are the dominant BA subspecies irrespective of the oestrus cycle stage. Moreover, BA concentrations in blood compared to those in the FF were similar. For the first time these results clearly highlight the presence of different BA subspecies in FF, blood and urine during the oestrus cycle in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bile Acids and Salts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follicular Fluid</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The sera were tested for antibodies against the Brucella spp. using commercial ELISA kits. Some sera were also tested at 1/80 for antibodies to C. burnetii using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Positive sera were also tested at 1/640. None of 599 cattle, 462 sheep or 434 goats were positive in the Brucella ELISAs. None of 230 cattle had antibodies against C. burnetii, but one of 299 sheep was positive at 1/80 (Dominica - 1/54, 2%, 95% CI (0%-5.6%)), as were two of 314 goats, at 1/80 (Grenada - 1/53, 2%, 95% CI (0%-7.5%)) and 1/640 (St Kitts - 1/18, 5.6%, 95% CI (0%-16.7%)), and one of 34 cats, at 1/80 (St Kitts - 1/34; 3%, 95% CI (0%-8.8%)). Our data suggests that there is a very low prevalence or absence of B. melitensis and B. abortus on Caribbean islands. Coxiella burnetii, however, is present but it appears to be present on only some islands and then only at low levels. Overall, there appears to be a low threat to human and animal health from these organisms in the Caribbean.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella abortus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella melitensis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>West Indies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 15 primiparous sows (Landrace &#215; Yorkshire) were randomly divided into three treatments with five replicates. Dietary treatments were: CON, basal diet; E1, CON + 0.025% E. faecium; E2, CON + 0.05% E. faecium. No significant differences were observed on body weight and feed intake of lactating sows with E. faecium supplementation, but linearly increased the sow apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and gross energy (GE; p &lt; .05), and decreased piglets pre-weaning mortality (p &lt; .05). Piglets from E. faecium-supplemented sows linearly increased weaning weight, average daily gain (ADG) and gain:feed ratio (p &lt; .05), as well as linearly decreased diarrhoea score (p &lt; .05) in the first weaning week. Piglets from E. faecium-supplemented sows linearly increased faecal Lactobacillus and Enterococci counts (p &lt; .05), while linearly decreased faecal Escherichia coli counts (p &lt; .05) after weaning. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of E. faecium improved the ATTD of DM, N and GE in lactating sows, as well as improved body weight, ADG and shifted faecal microbiota in their litters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enterococcus faecium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Probiotics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Six organs, the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, duodenum and pectoralis muscle, were collected from naturally infected Pekin ducks. Paraffin embedded tissues were examined, and the results were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-Square test. The results showed that the detection rates by IHC were similar with ZN staining in liver, lung, spleen and pectoralis muscle, but the detection rates by IHC were much higher than ZN staining in kidney and duodenum (p = .013, p = .0044). The liver (87.5%) and lung (81.3%) had the highest detection rates. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were primarily found intracellularly in six organs using ZN staining. Similarly, the MAA antigens in those selected organs were also detected in the cytoplasm with different cell types. Specifically, MAA antigen was distributed in epithelioid macrophages and necrotic centres within the liver, lung, spleen and kidney, while they were observed in macrophages of the lamina propria and duodenal glands and degenerative myocytes in the pectoralis muscle. This comparative study provides an important insight into the distribution of MAA in infected domestic ducks and indicates that the detection rate by IHC was higher than that of ZN staining.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ducks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staining and Labeling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tuberculosis, Avian</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eight genes, FSHB, LHB, FSHR, LHCGR, ESR2, B4GANT2, BCL2 and BAX, were examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the LHB and BAX genes were not different, but there was one base change in the FSHR genes between the two breeds. There was one base change in the FSHB gene, which resulted in one amino acid substitution; there were nine base changes in the LHCGR gene, which resulted in five amino acid substitutions; and there were six base changes in the B4GANT2 gene, which resulted in four amino acid substitutions. The expression levels of the FSHR, LHCGR, ESR2, B4GANT2, BCL2 and BAX genes in the ovaries were not different between the two breeds. The plasma concentrations of FSH were not different, but the plasma concentrations of LH, P4 and E2 were lower in prolific Jintang black goats than in nonprolific Tibetan goats (P &#706; 0.05) at 40 hr after removal of the Controlled Internal Drug Release Devices.

Melatonin an antioxidant is able to modulate the effect of ROS and prevents spermatozoa by reducing the oxidative stress during freezing process. Eight ejaculates from eight healthy HF bulls diluted with Tris egg yolk glycerol extender were divided into five equal aliquots. The Computer Assisted Semen Analyser (CASA) results showed no significant difference between the control-post- thaw samples and melatonin-treated samples; however, the velocity of spermatozoa with regard to the VAP, VSL showed highest increase in the 0.25 mM MLT-treated semen followed by 0.1 mM MLT treated semen except for VCL where velocity increased with increase in the concentration of melatonin. The vigour of spermatozoa regard to BCF, STR and LIN recorded highest increase in the 0.25 mM MLT treated semen followed by 0.1 mM MLT-treated semen except for the ALH where vigour increased with increase in the concentration of melatonin. The electron micrography images illustrated that the addition of 0.1 mM melatonin protected the plasma membrane and acrosome region and maintained the ultrastructure integrity of the cryopreserved spermatozoa when compared to control group, whereas the electron micrography of spermatozoa treated with 0.2 and 0.25 mM melatonin illustrated highest damage to the plasma and acrosome membrane. Thus concluding that inclusion of melatonin to sperm extender can improve the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved bull spermatozoa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryopreservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melatonin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microscopy, Electron, Transmission</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurotransmitter Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reactive Oxygen Species</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sperm Motility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Seven-week-old 50 White Marshall broilers (Br) and 50 Isa Brown pullets (Pu) were randomly divided into four groups: vaccinated broilers chickens; (VBr), unvaccinated broiler chickens (UBr), and vaccinated pullet chickens (VPu) and unvaccinated pullet chickens (UPu). Chickens in groups VBr and VPu were vaccinated with La Sota vaccine, whereas groups UBr and UPu were not vaccinated. On day 0 post vaccination (PV), six chickens from group Br and Pu, and on day 4 PV, three chickens from each four groups were sacrificed and the bursa weight index (BWI), thymus weight index (TWI) and the splenic weight index (SWI) were obtained. The chickens were observed for clinical signs and lesions. Serum samples were collected from the chickens in all the groups on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 PV and assayed for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. The BWI, TWI and SWI were 0.37 &#177; 0.05, 0.35 &#177; 0.17, 0.65 &#177; 0.26 for pullets and 0.11 &#177; 0.04, 0.13 &#177; 0.02, 0.36 &#177; 0.17 for broilers on day 0 PV. On day 4 PV there was no significant difference (p &lt; .05) between the indices of the vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens. The geometrical mean antibody titres (GMT) of the pullets were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the broilers on days 7 to 28 PV. Vaccination did not produce clinical signs or lesions. The above observations show that naturally pullets produce higher antibodies than broilers because of their higher BWI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibody Formation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bursa of Fabricius</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organ Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Gland</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viral Vaccines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The study was carried out between October and November 2016. A total of 1,520 sera samples (928 cattle, 216 goats, 254 sheep and 122 dromedaries) were collected randomly for FMD serological analyses. Nine epithelial tissue samples were also collected from cattle showing clinical signs, for FMDV isolation and characterization. Serological results showed an overall NSP seroprevalence of 40% (375/928) in cattle in our sample (95% CrI [19-63]). However, seroprevalences of 84% (27/32), 78% (35/45) and 84% (21/25) were estimated in cattle over 5 years of age in East Batha, West Batha and Wadi Fira, respectively. In cattle under 1 year of age, 67% (18/27) seroprevalence was estimated in Wadi Fira, 64% (14/22) in East Batha and 59% (13/22) in West Batha. It was found that the high seroprevalences have been obtained in areas where pastures are shared by several different herds but also in farms where two to three species (bovine, caprine and ovine) are raised together. ELISA PrioCHECK[&#174;] FMDV types O and A and in-house solid phase competition ELISA serotyping results showed that the four O, A, SAT1 and SAT2 serotypes have circulated in Chad in 2016. However, the type SAT2 dominated with an overall seroprevalence of 43% (29/67) and was present in the four areas investigated. The phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 coding sequence allowed determining the serotype SAT2 topotype VII, close to viral strains found in Cameroon in 2015 with a similarity of 98.60%.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chad</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot-and-Mouth Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, RNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The owners of 44 dogs with histologically different tumours were offered the &#187;Cancer Treatment Form&#171; at least one month after treatment. The owners assessed their dogs' quality of life (QoL) after treatment as good (mean 7.4) (from 1-very poor to 10-excellent) and the general health compared with the initial diagnosis of cancer as improving (mean 3.9) (from 1-worse to 5-better). The assessment of the current QoL was better within the group of dogs treated with non-invasive treatment (ECT and/or IL-12 GET only), compared with those that received invasive treatment, where, in addition to ECT and/or IL-12 GET, surgery was performed (p &lt; .05). The owners of dogs that achieved an objective response (OR) to the treatment assessed the QoL as significantly better compared with those whose dogs did not respond to the treatment (p &lt; .05). The majority of the owners (86.4%) would opt for the therapy again, regardless of the financial costs. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the majority of the owners of dogs assessed their dogs' QoL as good and felt that it improved after the treatment, especially in dogs, treated with non-invasive treatment and in those that responded to the treatment. This supports further use of ECT and IL-12 GET as suitable methods for the treatment of selected tumours in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrochemotherapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroporation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interleukin-12</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Secondary infections sometimes necessitate withdrawal of cyclosporine, but it is not known how long it takes for the immune system to recover after cessation of cyclosporine. Our goal was to utilize a validated RT-qPCR assay in dogs to assess recovery time of the T-cell cytokines IL-2 and IFN-&#947; after discontinuation of cyclosporine. Six healthy dogs were given oral cyclosporine (10 mg/kg every 12 hr) for 1 week, with samples collected for measurement of cytokine gene expression prior to treatment, and on the last day of therapy. Cyclosporine was then discontinued, and samples were collected daily for an additional 7 days. Results revealed that there was a significant difference in cytokine expression when comparing pre-treatment and immediate post-treatment values, corresponding to marked suppression of T-cell function. There was no significant difference between pre-treatment values for either cytokine when compared with any day during the recovery period. Cytokine expression, evaluated as a percentage of pre-treatment baseline samples, demonstrated progressing return of T-cell function after drug cessation, with full recovery seen in all dogs by Day 4 of the recovery period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interferon-gamma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interleukin-2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>T-Lymphocytes</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 180 Sasso broiler breeder hens were used for the study. They were allotted to two groups each containing 3 replicates of 30 hens of 18 weeks of age. Dietary treatments were a control diet (basal diet without moringa leaves) and a diet containing 10g of moringa leaves in 1kg of control diet (1% w/w). The experiment lasted 40 weeks. The following production parameters; feed intake, egg weight, laying rate and feed conversion ratio were measured for the whole experimental period while egg quality and blood parameters were assessed at different ages. Results showed that laying rate and hatching egg weight were improved by moringa meal diet for the whole experimental period. Feed intake and feed conversation ratio were decreased (p &lt; .05) by incorporation of moringa leaves. Differences (p &lt; .01) were observed in albumen and yolk ratio at 55th week of age. Yolk colour was (p &lt; .001) improved by moringa meal at 31st, 43rd and 55th week of age. At the end of the experiment, serum concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and atherogenic index were decreased (p &lt; .05) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was unaffected (p &gt; .05) by incorporation of moringa in the diet. It was concluded that the use of moringa leaves as feed additive in Sasso breeders diet improved productivity and quality of hatching eggs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Moringa oleifera</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Leaves</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Multimodal analgesia that includes both systemically and locally/regionally administered drugs is generally the most effective approach to providing pain relief. Local anaesthetic drugs used in local and regional blockade are unique in that they can completely block the transmission of pain (in conscious patients) or nociceptive (in anaesthetized patients) signals, thereby providing profound analgesia. In addition, local and regional administration of drugs, when compared with systemic bolus administration, generally results in a lower incidence of dose-related adverse effects. Due to the potential to provide profound analgesia and the high safety margin (when used correctly) of this drug class, local anaesthetics are recommended as part of the analgesic protocol in the majority of patients undergoing surgical procedures or suffering traumatic injuries. This manuscript, Part 1 of a two-part instalment, emphasizes the importance of using local and regional anaesthesia as a component of multimodal analgesia, provides a review of the basic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of local anaesthetic drugs in general, lists information on commonly used local anaesthetic drugs for local and regional blockade in dogs and cats, and briefly introduces the novel liposome-encapsulated bupivacaine (NOCITA&#174;).

Local anaesthetic drugs used in local and regional blockade can completely block the transmission of nociceptive impulses, decreasing both intra-operative nociception and postoperative pain, while decreasing the potential incidence of adverse effects that can be associated with systemic boluses of drugs. For efficacy and safety, this class of drugs is recommended as part of the analgesic protocol in the majority of surgical procedures and traumatic injuries. Numerous local and regional blocks are proven effective in dogs and cats, thus providing the clinician with ample opportunity to include these blocks in practice. This manuscript, Part 2 of a two-part instalment, focuses on brief descriptions of select commonly used local/regional anaesthesia techniques for dogs and cats that cover a multitude of painful surgeries/injuries and that can be implemented in any practice.

The condition is classified based on the degree of non-separation of the hemispheres which, in turn, determines its severity. Holoprosencephaly is usually accompanied by craniofacial defects whose severity tends to reflect the extent of brain deformities. In humans, holoprosencephaly is one of the commonest congenital brain anomalies but in animals, reported cases are scarce. The condition has multifactorial aetiology that involves interactions between several genetic and environmental factors.</Abstract><Abstract>A 4-day-old female Friesian calf with a deformed face was reported to the Faculty of veterinary medicine and surgery, Egerton University. The calf and the dam were sired by the same bull. On clinical and radiographic examination, the calf had a short snout that curved dorsally with bilateral cleft lip, right-sided cleft jaw and a largely absent primary palate. Anatomopathological examination revealed brain deformities which included ventral fusion of frontal lobes of cerebral hemispheres, large merged lateral ventricles without septum pellucidum and fornix, hypoplastic corpus callosum, high degree of non-separation between diencephalic structures, poorly developed hippocampal formation and hypoplastic olfactory lobe, optic chiasma, and nerve.</Abstract><Abstract>The case was confirmed as lobar holoprosencephaly based on characteristic anatomopathological findings.

In addition, administration of the ovulation inducer human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) had the strongest effect on the pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG) concentration when the follicle size was 22.3 mm, suggesting that the follicle reaches this size before ovulation.

Thereafter, they were weekly monitored for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody decline. The first batch A of the layers were challenged with velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (vvND) virus (vvNDV) on day 24 post-vaccination (PV), when the geometric mean titre (GMT) was 84.4, batch B were challenged on day 48 PV at GMT of 42.2, while batch C were challenged on day 97 PV at GMT of 21.1. The individual chicken HI antibody titres of the 10 layers in batch C at the day of challenge were: 7 layers had HI titres of 16, 2 layers had HI titres of 32 and 1 layer had HI titres of 64. Each challenge in the three batches produced no clinical signs including drop in egg production. But there was initial swelling of the spleen followed by atrophy with high antibody responses. The virus was recovered in all the cloacal swabs on days 3-9 post-challenge (PC) at low titres. On days 145 PV and 48, post-Batch C challenge the remaining hyperimmunized unchallenged layers demonstrated a drop in total % egg production (p &lt; .05) and changes in egg quality. The HI GMT was 256. The virus was recovered in all the cloacal swabs on days 3-9 following appearance of clinical signs. There was no mortality in the experiment. Based on the above observations, it is concluded that triple La Sota re-vaccination can protect layers against a drop in egg production in areas where vvNDV infection is enzootic.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibody Formation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunization, Secondary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viral Vaccines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Categories determined by standards were correlated with the embryonic development stage, number of nuclei and viability. The results showed no differences in the blastocyst rate between the experimental (cloned Mexican bighorn sheep embryos) and control (parthenogenetic domestic sheep embryos) groups (p &gt; .05), while type IV fragmentation was higher in clones (p &lt; .05). The standards allowed for the identification of embryos that divided at least once or fragmented after 24 hr of culture. The highest percentage of morulae appeared at 96 hr, the final stages of development: nonsegmented, blocked, fragmented and blastocysts appeared at 192 hr. Embryonic quality decreased over time, making 96 hr the ideal time point to predict the final morphological quality of embryos. Nuclear staining of the morulae and blastocysts showed that higher embryo quality was associated with a higher percentage of normal and viable blastomeres. The evaluated criteria allowed for descriptions of the dynamics, stage and quality of cloned Mexican bighorn sheep embryos with a high degree of reliability. In addition, developmental anomalies, including fragmentation, multinucleation and blocking, were identified.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cloning, Organism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embryo, Mammalian</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embryonic Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Bighorn</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Most of the studies focused on cattle while, the prevalence of Ptb in sheep in different regions of the world is not well investigated. This study aimed to address this gap of knowledge by screening adult female sheep for paratuberculosis antibodies in different geographical regions of Tunisia. A total number of 338 female sheep from 15 small to middle-sized, extensively managed sheep farms in six regions across Tunisia were sampled. Animals were clinically examined before blood sampling. Sera were tested for the presence of anti-Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis antibodies using a commercial ELISA kit. Six farms out of 15 comprised at least one seropositive animal and 11 female sheep out of 338 tested animals (3.25%; 95% CI = [1.83-5.73]) were seropositive to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The seroprevalence was significantly lower in 5-year-old females (p = .04) and animals that do not graze (p = .02).

The aim of this study was to compare combined laparoscopic ovariectomy (OIE) and laparoscopic-assisted incisional gastropexy (LAG) with combined laparoscopic OIE and total laparoscopic gastropexy (TLG) for surgical time, incidence of complications and postoperative pain. Twenty-eight female dogs were randomly assigned to the LAG group (n = 14) or the TLG group (n = 14). All laparoscopic procedures were performed using a three-port technique. The gastropexy was located 3 cm caudal to the 13th rib and 4 cm lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle. Surgical time (minutes [min]), intraoperative complications and postoperative complications were recorded. The Glasgow pain score (GPS) (short form) was calculated before surgery and at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hr after extubation. Surgical time was significantly longer in the TLG group (48 &#177; 2 min) compared with the LAG group (39 &#177; 2 min). Minor postoperative complications occurred in both groups and included swelling (n = 2) and subcutaneous emphysema (n = 1). No significant differences regarding the GPS were recorded between groups. The GPS was significantly higher in both groups at 1 hr and 6 hr than before surgery. Two dogs in each group required rescue analgesia. Combined laparoscopic OIE and TLG require more time to perform than combined laparoscopic OIE and LAG. Neither procedure results in significant surgical complications. Postoperative pain for 24 hr was mild and comparable in both groups.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastropexy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Operative Time</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

CDV replicates readily in epithelial, nerve and lymphoid tissues; it is excreted in urine, feces, saliva, oral and nasal discharge; and its major route of entry for infection is through the respiratory system. Although the virus was originally believed to infect domestic dogs, new studies have shown that it can also naturally or experimentally infect non-domestic hosts. A recent blood test performed on a giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) found Lentz inclusions in the animal's leucocytes. A rapid CDV test, an RT-PCR assay and pathology findings confirmed this report of canine morbillivirus in this species, which corresponds to the second report of CDV infection in the order Pilosa, family Myrmecophagidae in central west Brazil.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Zoo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brazil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper Virus, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eutheria</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The limited implementation of biosecurity standards in these operations makes BPS a potential source for the emergence of pathogens that have an impact on both animal and public health. Information regarding circulation of influenza A virus (IAV) in poultry and swine raised in BPS is scarce; particularly in South American countries. The objective of this study was to estimate prevalence and seroprevalence of IAV in BPS in central Chile, identify subtype diversity, evaluate risk factors and spatial relative risk for IAV. Samples were collected from 329 BPS from central Chile. Seroprevalence at BPS level was 34.7% (95% CI: 23.1%-46.2%), 19.7% (95% CI: 9.9%-30.6%) and 11.7% (95% CI: 7.2%-16.4%), whereas prevalence at BPS level was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.0%-8.8%), 8.2% (95% CI: 0.8%-14.0%) and 9.2% (95% CI: 4.8%-13.1%), for the Metropolitan, Valparaiso and LGB O'Higgins regions, respectively. Spatial analysis revealed that central-western area of Metropolitan region and the southern province of Valparaiso region could be considered as high-risk areas for IAV (spatial relative risk = 2.2, p &lt; .05). Logistic regression models identified the practice of breeding both poultry and pigs at the BPS as a risk factor (95% CI 1.06-3.75). From 75 IAV ELISA-positive sera, 20 chicken sera had haemagglutination inhibition titres ranging from 20 to 160, and of these, 11 had microneutralization titres ranging from 40 to 960 for one or more IAV subtypes. Identified subtypes were H1, H3, H4, H9, H10 and H12. Results from this study highlight the need for further IAV surveillance programmes in BPS in Chile. Early detection of IAV strains circulating in backyard animals, especially in regions with large human populations, could have an enormous impact on animal and public health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chile</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ducks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Geese</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza A virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Influenza in Birds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orthomyxoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Assessment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkeys</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32088933</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>European Brown hare (Lepus europaeus) as a source of emerging and re-emerging pathogens of Public Health importance: A review.</Title>	<Abstract>European brown hare (Lepus europaeus, EBH) is probably the most important game animal in Europe throughout its historical distribution. The decline in its populations across its geographic range in Europe have been attributed to factors such as reproductive rate and the ability for adaptation, climate, feed availability, predators, anthropogenic factors and diseases. Apart from common diseases of hares with a high impact on their mortality such as European Brown hare Syndrome, EBH has been involved in the epidemiology of pathogens with zoonotic potential. In this work, the role of EBH as a source of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Yersinia spp., Brucella spp., Francisella tularensis, Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania infantum is discussed. Hares may significantly contribute to the epidemiology of important emerging zoonotic pathogens through maintenance of high endemicity levels as in the case of CCHFV, as a reservoir of important pathogens such as Yersinia spp., B. suis, F. tularensis and L. infantum and as a potential source of T. gondii for other animals, especially for carnivores but also for humans. However, EBH may also be a host of minor importance as in the case of HEV. The continuous surveillance of hare populations will enable the collection of information on the population health status and the pathogens currently circulating in the area posing risk for wildlife, domestic animals and humans. The possible live animal translocations of infected hares, the fact that this species acts as a host of vectors (fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and sandflies) and the prey of carnivores and omnivores that travel in great distances getting into contact with domestic animals and humans, further highlights the need to be included in surveillance studies. Besides, the hunter-harvested EBH population is an excellent indicator for recent pathogen transmission due to its short lifespan.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Communicable Diseases, Emerging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hares</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Public Health</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>32100471</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Fermentation of fibre rich ingredients exposed in vitro to the faecal inoculums of swine and turkeys.</Title>	<Abstract>This study was focused on in vitro fermentation and in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility of different fibre rich ingredients that can be used in diets of pigs and turkeys. In vitro DM digestibility was determined by Daisy system via using faecal or excreta fluid of swine/turkeys as a source of inoculum. The ingredients used as substrates were commercial swine or turkey diet, dried beet pulp, wheat bran, hay, straw and two types of lignocelluloses (A and B). Marked differences between the ingredients were found and the values were: dried beet pulp (80%), swine/turkey diet (75%), wheat bran (60%), hay (40%) and straw (10%-20%). Of special interest are the data on the two lignocellulose products, the in vitro DM digestibility of product A was in the range of 20% (in turkeys) up to 30% (in pigs), whereas the product B had values of &lt;5%. Moreover, the inoculums were incubated with the same substrates for 24h using gas measuring technique. Consecutively, commercial swine or turkey diet, dried beet pulp, wheat bran and hay produced high amounts of gas and volatile fatty acids. Lignocellulose A and straw provided lower and equal amounts of gases and fatty acids. However, lignocellulose B showed very little fermentation compared to the product A. In conclusions, faecal or excreta can be used as a source of microbial activity to determine the in vitro DM digestibility or fermentation of feeds. Comparing lignocellulose products with traditional fibre sources, the DM digestibility of lignocellulose A was greater than straw but its fermentation rate seems to be equal to straw. Thus, lignocellulose A can be used as a new source of fibre in diets of monogastric animals to optimize the gut health and improving the faeces or excreta quality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Fiber</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fermentation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkeys</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

There is little information about its reproduction and the present study aims to morphologically characterize the reproductive organs of male K.scorpioides bred in captivity in two seasons of the year. The reproductive tracts of adult animals under went macroscopic ultrastructural analysis of the lumen, as well as scanning electron and transmission microscopy. Macroscopically, the male genital organs consist of a pair of testicles, epididymis, the vas deferens and a penis. Testicles, epididymis and deferents ducts were characterized by reproductive activity during the rainy season and reproductive inactivity in the dry period. The morphometry regarding the tubular and luminal diameter and epithelial height of the testicles, epididymis and deferents ducts showed changes along the studied periods. The rainy season presented higher averages than the dry period. The penis did not show any changes during both periods. It was concluded that K. scorpioides exhibits reproductive seasonality.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Zoo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genitalia, Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turtles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The total of 288 1-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to four groups with six replications according to initial body weight. Four treatment groups were designed as follows and fed the indicated diets: CON, basal diet; T1, basal diet supplemented with 0.3 g/kg SB; T2, basal diet supplemented with 0.6 g/kg SB; T3, basal diet supplemented with 1.2 g/kg SB. During days 1-21, broilers fed the T2 diet had higher (p &lt; .05) average daily gain (ADG) than broilers fed the CON diet. On day 21, dietary SB supplementation showed linear increase (p &lt; .05) in relative weight of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, small intestine (the sum weight of duodenum, jejunum and ileum), pancreas and thymus, and linear increase (p &lt; .05) in relative length of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, small intestine (the sum length of duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and caeca. Meanwhile, dietary SB supplementation showed linear increase in the antibody titer against ND on days 14, 21, 28 and 35. In conclusion, dietary SB supplementation improved the development of gastrointestinal by increasing the relative weight and length, as well as enhanced the immune response of ND vaccine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Butyric Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Tract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immune System</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Currently, there is impaired knowledge on zoonotic pathogens in rodents and insectivores in the Netherlands. This limits opportunities for preventive measures and complicates risk-assessments for zoonotic transmission to humans. Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are present on a list of prioritized emerging pathogens in the Netherlands and were therefore the focus of this study. Both pathogens have the ability to survive under moist environmental conditions. In total, a group of 379 small mammals (rodents &amp; insectivores) were tested on pathogenic Leptospira spp., and 312 on T. gondii. Rodents and insectivores were trapped at various sites, but mostly on pig and dairy farms throughout the country. Over five percent of the animals (5.3%, n = 379) tested positive for Leptospira DNA, and five of the animals (1.6%, n = 312) tested were positive for T. gondii DNA. The animals positive for T.gondii were all brown rats and the ones for Leptospira spp. were various species. Our results show that insectivores and rodents might be used as an indicator for the environmental contamination and/or the contamination in wildlife for Leptospira spp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Reservoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eulipotyphla</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospira</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospirosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Netherlands</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodentia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxoplasma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxoplasmosis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The RT-qPCR data showed that the MXD3 gene was variably expressed between all tissues and at levels that were significantly different between two breeds (p &lt; .05). We used the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to investigate the possible association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the MXD3 gene and five different growth traits in cattle. We found two intronic SNPs (g.2694 C&gt;T and g.3801 T&gt;C) and one SNP in 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) (g.6263 G&gt;A) of MXD3 gene.

The aims of this study were to investigate the association between body condition score (BCS) and the prognosis of canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) and the relationships between adiponectin expression and tumour behaviour. Seventy-three bitches with tubular, tubulopapillary, solid or complex carcinomas were included in the present study. For each dog, evaluation of BCS was conducted using a nine-point BCS system and the study population was divided into normal weight (4-5/9 points; n = 42), overweight (6-7/9 points; n = 19) and obese (8-9/9 points; n = 12). Type of diet (commercial, homemade or mixed) was recorded. After surgical excision, histological type, tumour size and nodal status were assessed and adiponectin expression was determined and quantified by immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis. CMC histotype was not correlated with BCS, while a positive correlation between BCS and histological grade (p &lt; .01) was observed. Overweight and obese bitches combined showed a shorter cancer-specific survival than normal weighted bitches (p &lt; .01). Bitches fed with a homemade diet had a higher BCS than dogs fed with a commercial one, although no relationship was observed between diet and cancer-specific survival. Thirty-six CMCs scored positive for adiponectin expression (49%), but no correlation was found between the hormone expression and either CMC characteristics or prognosis. In conclusion, a higher BCS seems to be related with a higher prevalence of more aggressive CMCs and negatively affects the survival time in bitches with these mammary tumours.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adiponectin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Progression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Obesity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Overweight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of yeast glycoprotein (YG) against Aeromonas caviae. Pathogens were isolated from liver of diseased Carassius auratus gibelio. Based on morphological and biochemical analysis, together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolated strains were identified as A. caviae and concluded as clones of a single strain and named L2. Further pathogenicity analysis revealed that A. caviae possessed &#946;-haemolysis, and its median lethal dose for C. gibelio was 1.33 &#215; 10[6] CFU/ml. Hepatic adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase activities of C. gibelio were inhibited post-A. caviae infection. Antimicrobial drug test suggested that A. caviae was a multidrug-resistant organism but could be inhibited by YG in vitro. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration of YG was 83.3 mg/ml and 166.7 mg/ml, respectively. Microbiota sequencing results showed that YG supplement could obviously decrease the relative abundance of Aeromonas and increase the microbial diversity. Our study revealed that A. caviae from C. gibelio was a multidrug-resistant bacteria strain, and could be significantly inhibited by YG in vivo and in vitro, thus providing important insights into ecological control and pathogenesis of A. caviae in aquaculture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aeromonas caviae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fish Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fungal Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycoproteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goldfish</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Partial sequencing of the hypervariable region of the fusion gene identified the presence of an avirulent (lentogenic) fusion protein motif (GRQGRL). Phylogenetic analysis of the new isolate along with previously known regional isolates revealed that the new isolate was related to genotype II strains. Additionally, sequence analysis indicated a distinct genetic lineage of the new isolate, which was related to some of the lineages identified in previous outbreaks in the Middle East.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study offers essential information on the epidemiology, characteristics and diagnosis of NDV for disease control in Iraq.

<Rec><Common><PMID>32233079</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Poisonous substances used to capture and kill the greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus).</Title>	<Abstract>The greater cane rat, as it is commonly known, is often called grasscutter (in Ghana, Nigeria and other regions of West Africa). Even though is highly patronized as a delicacy by a majority of Ghanaians (akrantie-Twi language) mostly in the rural areas, the persistent reports on people being poisoned as a result of eating food prepared with grasscutter which has been captured/killed by the use of poison are deterring people from consuming the grasscutter meat despite its high protein content. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the actual ingredients that are used in the formulation of poison to capture grasscutter for human consumption. Questionnaires were administered to participants (farmers) who are involved in grasscutter hunting to solicit the ingredient they formulate to poison the grasscutter in their hunting. To prove the activeness of these ingredients, the main ingredient used in formulating the poison to capture the grasscutters were tested on two male grasscutters and these were yellow oleander root (Cascabela thevetia; syn: Thevetia peruviana) powder and carbofuran. The findings of the experimental trial revealed that the grasscutter that was fed with yellow oleander root powder did not die but showed some signs of intoxication and staggered each time it tried to move. However, the grasscutter fed with carbofuran died within 10 hr of being poisoned. Majority of the participants attested to the fact that the use of poison increases their chance of capturing the grasscutter, especially in the dry season since the poison is not washed away by the rainwater. However, consuming grasscutter poisoned with either yellow oleander root power or carbofuran could be detrimental to human health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Contamination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ghana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poisons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodentia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32239803</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Expression of transferrin receptor-1 (TFR-1) in canine osteosarcomas.</Title>	<Abstract>Due to high rates of proliferation and DNA synthesis, neoplastic cells have higher requirements of iron than normal cells. For that reason, neoplastic cells have remodelled iron metabolism pathways, over-expressing genes encoding for iron uptake proteins, among which Transferrin Receptor-1 (TFR-1). Accumulating evidence has proven that overexpression of TFR-1 and high Iron concentration, are both widespread condition of cancer cells, both essential to tumour onset and progression. We studied TFR-1 and PCNA immunohistochemical expression in fifteen (15) Canine osteoblastic osteosarcomas (COS). After immunohistochemical staining, counting of TFR-1 positive cells by two independent observers showed that 85%-95% of neoplastic cells were strongly labelled at cytoplasmic level by anti-TFR-1 antibody in all examined COS. Furthermore, 70%-80% of neoplastic cells were positively labelled at the nuclear level by PCNA. Surprisingly, about 100% of intratumour vascular endothelial cells were also positive, whereas extratumour vascular endothelial cells were negative. The latter is an interesting finding, as TFR-1 is usually not expressed in normal vasculature, with the exception of normal brain vascular endothelium, where it allows transport of transferrin, and thus iron, into tissues, suggesting a similar function here to support cancer growth. The early results presented highlight the relevance of TFR-1 expression in canine OS, suggesting therapies involving both TFR-1 and Iron metabolisms in dogs with osteosarcoma should be developed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iron</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptors, Transferrin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It leads to considerable economic losses as a result of low productivity of infected animals and the long debilitating illness in humans. Despite its impact on human and animal health, little attention has been paid on Brucella infections in domestic animals. It is in this light that the prevalence of Brucella antibodies was determined in domestic animals with the overarching goal of improving our knowledge on brucellosis in southern Cameroon. During cross-sectional studies conducted from December 2016 to August 2018 in five sites of southern Cameroon, blood samples were collected in cattle, sheep, goat, pig and dog. Plasma was obtained from each blood sample and Brucella antibodies were detected using the Rose Bengal test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 1873 animals that were sampled, the overall prevalence of Brucella antibodies using Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) was 6.35% (118/1873): 9.12% (78/855) in cattle; 8.04% (30/373) in sheep; 6.06% (2/33) in dog, 1.87% (3/160) in pig and 1.1% (5/452) in goat. Between animal species (p-value &lt; .0001, x[2] = 33.63) as well as sampling sites (p-value = .0001, x[2] = 18.97), significant differences were observed in the prevalence of Brucella antibodies. Yoko and Noun localities have shown the highest prevalence of 8.6% (30/348) and 7.2% (78/1070), respectively. This prevalence was significantly higher (p = .03, x[2] = 1.25) in female than male cattle. Between adult (16.923%) and young cattle (7.8%), significant difference (p = .04, x[2] = 6.42) was observed in the prevalence of Brucella antibodies. This study shows that the prevalence of Brucella antibodies varies between animal species and localities. It also shows several domestic animals of southern Cameroon that have been in contact with Brucella. It enabled to identify villages where investigations on the transmission dynamic must be focused for the final goal of developing control measures for this neglected zoonotic disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cameroon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An evaluation of farmer's behaviour on farms can be used to identify the risk factors and to develop tailored control strategies. This study documents the knowledge of zoonotic poultry diseases (ZPD) among 152 poultry farm workers (respondents) from 76 farms in the Ashanti region of Ghana and assessed their on-farm attitude and practices that increase their risk to exposure of ZPD. The median age of respondents was 29 years, 91.4% (n = 139) had a formal education, and 80.9% (n = 123) had worked on the farm for more than 1 year. The majority of farms (n = 69, 90.8%) had multiple flocks and 27.6% (n = 21) kept other animals, of which 57.1% (n = 12) were pigs. The majority of respondents had good knowledge about poultry diseases but not about ZPD. A higher level of education and longer work experience improved respondents' knowledge of poultry and ZPD. Although respondents identified the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) as a major ZPD preventive measure, the majority did not put that knowledge into practice. Most farms (71.1%, n = 54) had no footbath and 55.3% (n = 42) deposited farm-waste on the farm. While 97.4% (n = 148) of respondents washed their hands after working, only 48.7% (n = 74) wore protective footwear, 2.7% (n = 4) wore overalls, 2% (n = 3) wore nose masks and none (n = 0) wore gloves. The husbandry practices and attitude of farmers expose them to pathogens on the farm and increase their risk of becoming infected with ZPD in the sub-region. The results from this study could be used to promote human health among farm workers in Ghana.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged, 80 and over</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ghana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Young Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fifteen (15) male and 225 female parents forming generation 0 were selected from the Leizhou duck population. Fifteen (15) families were created in the ratio of 1 male:15 females. Eggs from all the families were collected and numbered according to the family. Generation 1 ducklings were selected and grouped into families in the same ratio. Body weights (BWs) and linear body dimensions were recorded every 2 weeks from weeks 0 to 16. Logistic, Gompertz and Von Bertalanffy models were employed to ascertain the growth model of both sexes of Leizhou Black Ducks. Except for weeks 0-2, generation 1 families had greater BWs than the generation 0 families (p &lt; .05). Males from both generations had significantly higher (p &lt; .01) BWs than females at 16 weeks old. Significant positive correlations were observed between BWs and measured body dimensions for both sexes except for between BW and pelvis width (PW) where negative correlations (p &gt; .05) were observed for males at week 10 and females at 16 weeks old. There was a significant negative correlation (p &lt; .01) between body length and PW in males at 10 weeks. The accuracy rate of Logistic, Gompertz and Von Bertalanffy models was at 0.972 and similar was obtained by all three models with Von Bertalanffy being the best model. Live weight of generation 1 before slaughter was significantly higher (p &lt; .01) than generation 0, whereas no significant differences were seen in the other carcass traits. These findings provide insights into breeding Leizhou Black Duck to enhance growth performance and hybrid production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ducks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Models, Biological</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenotype</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32266769</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Genetic variation of Brucella isolates at strain level in Egypt.</Title>	<Abstract>In this study, Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA-16) was performed on 18 Brucella isolates identified bacteriologically and molecularly (AMOS-PCR) as Brucella abortus (n = 6) and Brucella melitensis (n = 12). This was aimed to study the genetic association among some Egyptian Brucella genotypes isolated during the period from 2002 to 2013 along with the global genotypes database. MLVA-16 analysis for B. melitensis and B. abortus strains illustrates a total of 11, and 3 genotypes with 10 and 1 singleton genotypes, respectively. B. melitensis strains displayed greater markers diversity by VNTRs analysis of the 16 loci than B. abortus and this was attributed mainly to the diverging in panel 2B markers. B. melitensis genotype M4_Fayoum_Giza (3,5,3,13,1,1,3,3,8,21,8,7,5,9,5,3) was the only predominated genotype circulating between two different governorates. The most common B. abortus genotype, GT A3_Dakahlia (4,5,4,12,2,2,3,3,6,21,8,4,4,3,4,4), was present in three identical isolates. In phylogeny, Egyptian B. abortus bv1 genotypes were closely related to East Asian strain (for the first time), Western Mediterranean and Americas clonal lineages. B. melitensis local genotypes exhibit a genetic relatedness mostly to Western Mediterranean clonal lineage and one strain of Eastern Mediterranean clonal lineage. In conclusion, the geographic location is not the only factor stands behind the high genetic similarity of the Egyptian Brucella genotypes. These low variations may be a result of a stepwise mutational event of the most variable loci from a very limited number of ancestors especially during the transmission through non-preference hosts. The authors encourage the authorities in charge to establish pre-movement testing to reduce the risk of brucellosis spread.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Brucella abortus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella melitensis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Egypt</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Variation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>32306524</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Methadone does not potentiate the effect of doxorubicin in canine tumour cell lines.</Title>	<Abstract>Opioid receptor activation was shown to enhance the efficacy of anti-neoplastic drugs in several human cancer cell lines. In these cell lines, doxorubicin increased the number of opioid receptors and methadone concurrently enhanced cellular doxorubicin uptake. Triggered through lay press and media, animal owners started to challenge veterinary oncologists with questions about methadone use in anti-cancer therapy. Especially in veterinary medicine, where side effects of chemotherapy are tolerated to a lesser extent and hence smaller doses are given, agents potentiating chemotherapeutic agents would be an optimal approach to treatment. Canine transitional cell carcinoma cells (TCC, K9TCC), canine osteosarcoma cells (OSA, Abrams) and canine hemangiosarcoma cells (HSA, DAL-4) were incubated with different combinations of methadone, buprenorphine and doxorubicin, in order to test inhibition of cell proliferation. Opioid receptor density was assessed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting in drug native and doxorubicin pretreated cells. In TCC and OSA cell lines opioid receptor density increased after doxorubicin pretreatment. In combination treatment, however, we did not find significant potentiation of doxorubicin's inhibitory effect on proliferation in these cell lines. Neither was there a significant increase of the effect of doxorubicin when the opioids were added 24 hr before doxorubicin. Hence, we could not confirm the hypothesis that opioids increase the anti-proliferative effect of the anti-neoplastic drug doxorubicin in any of these canine tumour cell lines. The lack of effect on a cellular level does not warrant a clinical approach to use opioids together with doxorubicin in dogs with cancer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buprenorphine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Line, Tumor</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Proliferation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methadone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To understand the effect of fluoroquinolone antibiotic bath administration on fish gut microbiota, the gut microbiota community in the coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Lacep&#232;de, 1802) was studied after enrofloxacin bathing treatment at two concentrations (5 and 10 mg/L) and 0 mg/L as control. A total of 90 fish were used in this study, and three replicates were used for each treatment. After a 24-hr bath, the gut bacterial composition was analyzed using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. The results indicated that the richness, diversity and the dominant bacterial taxa of P. leopardus gut bacteria were not affected by enrofloxacin bathing (p &gt; .05). Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla, and Exiguobacterium, Citrobacter, Vibrio, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas were the dominant genus.

For this, we collected 1,405 serum samples from buffaloes raised in the Amazon delta region, which is considered a major area of buffalo production in Brazil. The test used was a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting 34 Leptospira antigens, some of which have never been tested for buffaloes in Brazil, including autochthonous strains; in total, 20 serogroups were evaluated. From the total of 1,405 serum samples, 894 (63.6%) reacted in the MAT to at least one of the 20 serogroups, and 511 (36.4%) did not react. The serogroups Sejroe, Autumnalis and Pomona were the most prevalent, with titres ranging from 100 to 12,800, and the autochthonous strains used were not significant in relation to the reference serovars. Leptospirosis in buffaloes seems to have a serological profile similar to leptospirosis in cattle, mainly due to the prevalence of the Sejroe serogroup; however, the results of this study suggested that in the Brazilian Amazon, Leptospira strains that are serologically distinct from the autochthonous strains isolated in the southeastern region of Brazil may be circulating in these animals. Other serovars could also be inserted into the panel of antigens used in MAT for serological studies on buffaloes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brazil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospira</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospirosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serogroup</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Synthetic dyes have been used for sperm viability and morphological evaluation. However, most of them have been made from chemical substances and have a perilous effect on the environment. In the current study, we evaluated three different natural dyes as the natural sources of dye for sperm staining. Bull frozen semen was used and prepared on slides for staining. Aqueous extract dye of black mulberry (BM), henna (HA), safflower (SA) and eosin-nigrosine (control group) were used for sperm staining. Additionally, the effect of staining dyes on viability and some morphological parameters (head area: HR, head abnormality: HB and tail abnormality: TA) were evaluated. Although none of the natural dyes could detect viability of the sperm cells, safflower stain (HR: 26.55 &#181;m, HB: 0% TA: 28%) and black mulberry stain (HR: 25.07 &#181;m, HB: 2% TA: 3%) compared to control group (HR: 34.29 &#181;m, HB: 4%, TA: 4%) provoked a strong reaction in the sperm cells, so that the sperms were observed yellow and red respectively. The reaction of sperm cells to the henna dye was very poor and it did not stain the sperm cells. Thus, the present study demonstrated that SA and BM dyes are able to stain the spermatozoa and with further modification could be used as alternative dyes for sperm staining in the study of sperm morphology, but not viability. Staining with these dyes can be an alternative to current costly chemical staining methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carthamus tinctorius</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coloring Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Morus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Naphthoquinones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Preparations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staining and Labeling</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Six concentrations of LeIBP (10[-1] ~ 10[4] &#956;g/ml) and AFPIII (10[-1] ~ 10[4] &#956;g/ml) were added to the bull semen extender, respectively. Sperm kinematic parameters were measured to examine sperm toxicity and cryopreserved sperm quality. Measures of antioxidant activity such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione/oxidative glutathione (GSH/GSSG), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analysed to identify the effect of LeIBP on sperm quality. In addition, sperm viability was analysed using a flow cytometer and fluorescence microscope by SYBR14/PI staining. The results showed that the LeIBP groups (0.1, 1 and 10 &#956;g/ml) were less toxic, and the quality of the sperm were dramatically improved in the extenders containing 0.1 &#956;g/ml LeIBP among concentrations of LeIBP and AFPIII. The SOD activity of LeIBP was greater than that of AFPIII and control. In addition, sperm viability was enhanced in the LeIBP-treated group. In summary, LeIBP is a useful cryoprotective adjuvant for bull sperm cryopreservation, and the most efficient concentration of LeIBP is 0.1 &#956;g/ml.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Basidiomycota</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carrier Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryopreservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryoprotective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Preservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The mean length of the CV was 2.8% of total length (TL) whereas each LAV was 22.4% of TL and, when combined, was approximately 16 times longer than the CV. The mean tissue thickness overlying each LAV increased significantly (p &lt; .001) with increasing TL and ranged from 3.5 to 33.8 mm in the smallest to largest shark. The mean internal diameter of the paired LAV also increased significantly (p &lt; .001) with increasing TL and was equal to or exceeded the CV. Experienced SCUBA divers captured 56 free-living grey nurse sharks and 46 healthy animals were sampled for blood from the LAV and CV with minimal risk to the animals or staff. Venipuncture of the LAV (n = 16) was easily accomplished using ultrasound guidance with a 38 mm/18-gauge needle, whereas standard methods were used with the CV (n = 30). Serum biochemistry was compared (t-tests) and none of the biochemical analytes differed significantly between the LAV and CV. The paired LAV produced representative blood samples and could also be used for fluid therapy and/or intravenous anaesthesia as has been done in other sharks. It is recommended that veterinary/husbandry staff familiarize themselves with the paired LAV and consider their use in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sharks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Interventional</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cancer patients treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deterioration in cognition. Doxorubicin (DOX, Adriamycin) is one of the anthracycline families used in chemotherapy, which has a deteriorating effect on both cognition and proliferation. The cognitive effects of ATX require inputs from the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to examine spatial memory and proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG in adult Lister Hooded rats treated either alone or with a combination of Atomoxetine (30 mg kg[-1] day[-1] , six i.p. doses, one injection every other day) and Doxorubicin (DOX) (2 mg kg[-1] day[-1] , six i.p. doses, one injection every other day). Spatial memory was tested using the Novel location recognition (NLR) test, and proliferation of hippocampal cells was quantified using immunohistochemistry for the proliferative marker Ki67. Results showed that ATX treatment has improved the NLR task and increased cell proliferation in the SGZ of the DG, compared with saline-treated controls. Animals treated with DOX only showed deficits in NLR task, and co-administration of ATX along with DOX did not improve their performance. DOX chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the SGZ of the DG compared with saline-treated controls. This reduction was reversed by co-administration of ATX. The above findings suggest that DOX can negatively affect both cell proliferation and memory and ATX co-administration improves proliferation, but not memory in the adult male rat hippocampus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibiotics, Antineoplastic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atomoxetine Hydrochloride</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Proliferation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hippocampus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Memory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

One hundred ninety-four stool samples from calves with diarrhoea less than one-month old were collected from five different geographical regions of country in order to detect coronavirus and characterize it if coronavirus was found. Samples were screened for the presence of BCoV by using a commercially available ELISA kit. Furthermore, RT-PCR was carried out on positive samples for confirmation of the presence of N and S specific genes. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out following RT-PCR tests. 7.2% of samples, were positive for BCoV and all stool samples from the South-West, Northeast and West regions of Iran were negative. The results showed that all the strains of coronavirus identified in Iran were completely in independent clusters and that they did not stand in the same cluster as any of the strains identified in other parts of the world. The strains from Iran were quite different from strains in other parts of the world but from the point of similarity these viruses showed some similarities to the European strains, such as those found in France, Croatia, Denmark and Sweden.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diarrhea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fibrous hypertrophy of the SSCT and subsequent adaptations in mechanical response are found in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), but not much is known about the development of the SSCT. This observational study describes the morphological development of SSCT using histology and ultramicroscopy in an animal model at four time points between late-term fetuses through adulthood. A transition is seen between 3 days and 6 weeks post-partum from a dense solid SSCT matrix to a complex multilayered structure connected with collagenous fibrils. These preliminary data show a developmental pattern that matches an adaptive response of the SSCT to loading and motion. Understanding the anatomical development aids in recognizing the pathophysiology of CTS and supports research on new therapeutic approaches.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Connective Tissue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, little is known about the association between polymorphism of the coding region of the MTNR1B gene and year-round oestrus or the litter size in Small Tail Han sheep. To better understand the effects of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs400827589 in MTNR1B, a population polymorphism analysis was conducted using genotyping data in 45 sheep breeds around the world. The results indicated that TT was the dominant genotype in all sheep breeds. The associations of this SNP with reproductive seasonality and litter size in Small Tail Han sheep showed rs400827589 was correlated with fecundity as assessed by reproductive seasonality and litter size (p &lt; .05). Bioinformatics analysis indicated the change in amino acid from Ile to Leu may affect the function of the MTNR1B protein by impacting the secondary and tertiary protein structures.

In our study, 62 faecal and intestinal samples from pigs with diarrhoea were collected in Guangxi Province, China, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve samples (19.4%, 12/62) were positive for PDCoV. Five complete genomes of PDCoV were then determined, and sequence alignment revealed that the five strains had discontinuous deletions at 400-401 aa in non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) and 758-760 aa in non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) compared with the respective proteins in the HKU15-44 strain. Notably, the CHN-GX81-2018 strain contained two insertions in the S gene and 3'-UTR. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%-98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN-AH-2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN-GX81-2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage. Recombination analyses revealed that four strains were the result of recombination between CHN-HB-2014 and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 strains. This study demonstrated the co-existence of multiple lineages of PDCoV in China, and our findings will aid the reorganization and evolution of the virus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deltacoronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Alignment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Nodules were surgically removed and each time histopathological diagnosis was fat necrosis and fibrosing to pyogranulomatous panniculitis. After the second surgery the alpha (&#945;)-tocopherol concentration in serum of the cat was examined and the result (21 mg/L) exceeded the upper limit of the reference interval (3-11 mg/L). Vitamin E amount in diet fed solely in the past was checked as studies have shown that vitamin E amounts in food significantly influence vitamin E concentrations in serum. For comparative purposes, &#945;-tocopherol concentrations were determined in sera of healthy control cats. Additionally, vitamin E amount in wet food from different manufacturers was analysed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the diet did not have higher vitamin E amounts compared to other diets. All control cats had similar high serum &#945;-tocopherol concentrations. We conclude that panniculitis can occur despite high serum &#945;-tocopherol concentrations in cats. Further studies are needed to redefine reference values of &#945;-tocopherol in serum of cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Panniculitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>alpha-Tocopherol</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32432381</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Gene regulation could be attributed to TCF3 and other key transcription factors in the muscle of pubertal heifers.</Title>	<Abstract>Puberty is a whole-body event, driven by the hypothalamic integration of peripheral signals such as leptin or IGF-1. In the process of puberty, reproductive development is simultaneous to growth, including muscle growth. To enhance our understanding of muscle function related to puberty, we performed transcriptome analyses of muscle samples from six pre- and six post-pubertal Brahman heifers (Bos indicus). Our aims were to perform differential expression analyses and co-expression analyses to derive a regulatory gene network associate with puberty. As a result, we identified 431 differentially expressed (DEx) transcripts (genes and non-coding RNAs) when comparing pre- to post-pubertal average gene expression. The DEx transcripts were compared with all expressed transcripts in our samples (over 14,000 transcripts) for functional enrichment analyses. The DEx transcripts were associated with "extracellular region," "inflammatory response" and "hormone activity" (adjusted p &lt; .05). Inflammatory response for muscle regeneration is a necessary aspect of muscle growth, which is accelerated during puberty. The term "hormone activity" may signal genes that respond to progesterone signalling in the muscle, as the presence of this hormone is an important difference between pre- and post-pubertal heifers in our experimental design. The DEx transcript with the highest average expression difference was a mitochondrial gene, ENSBTAG00000043574 that might be another important link between energy metabolism and puberty. In the derived co-expression gene network, we identified six hub genes: CDC5L, MYC, TCF3, RUNX2, ATF2 and CREB1. In the same network, 48 key regulators of DEx transcripts were identified, using a regulatory impact factor metric. The hub gene TCF3 was also a key regulator. The majority of the key regulators (22 genes) are members of the zinc finger family, which has been implicated in bovine puberty in other tissues. In conclusion, we described how puberty may affect muscle gene expression in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Regulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcription Factor 3</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A real-time recombinase polymerase amplification assay (real-time RPA) was developed for direct and rapid detection of H. parasuis basing on the translation-initiation factor IF2 (infB) gene. The assay was performed successfully at 39&#176;C for 20 min in Genie III, which is portable and chargeable by battery. The developed assay was highly specific for H. parasuis, and the limit of detection of the assay was 6.0 &#215; 10[3] fg of H. parasuis genomic DNA, which was the same as that of a real-time PCR developed previously. The assay was further evaluated on 68 pig tissue samples, and 18 (26.5%), 20 (29.4%), and 8 (11.8%) samples were positive for H. parasuis by the real-time RPA, real-time PCR and bacterial isolation, respectively. With the bacteria isolation as the reference method, the real-time RPA showed a diagnostic specificity of 83.33% and a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%.

Data were received during August 1-31, 2018 from a total of 2,751 survey responses. Forty-two percent (1,157) reported no flea treatment or adverse events (AE), while 58% (1594) had been treated with some parasiticide for flea control, and of those that received a parasiticide, the majority, or 83% (1,325), received an isooxazoline. When any flea treatment was given, AE were reported for 66.6% of respondents, with no apparent AE noted for 36.1%. Project Jake findings were compared to a retrospective analysis of publicly available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported AE. The number of total AE reported to FDA and EMA were comparable, although a 7 to 10 times higher occurrence of death and seizures was reported from the EMA or from outside the United States (US). Serious AE responses for death, seizures and neurological effects reported in our survey were higher than the FDA but moderately lower than the EMA reports. These sizable global data sets combined with this pre- and post-parasiticide administration survey indicated that isoxazoline neurotoxicity was not flea- and tick-specific.

Arrhythmias and sudden death have been documented in dogs undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy for heart base tumours. A study was proposed to interrogate the effect of different stereotactic-like radiation prescriptions on RIHD development, including arrhythmogenesis and classical histological endpoints in a mouse model. A pilot study was performed initially. The heart base of CD1 (n = 3) and C57Bl/6J (n = 3) female mice were irradiated (12 Gy &#215; 3, daily) with a clinical linear accelerator. No significant adverse effects were noted and each mouse survived the entire subsequent 3-month observation period. At various time points, no arrhythmias were identified on ECG analysis. Cardiac histology (haematoxylin and eosin, and picrosirius red staining) was performed at 3 months. In a single CD1 mouse and two C57BI/6J mice, multifocal, minimal, peri-vascular lymphoplasmacytic inflammation was noted within the irradiated proximal heart. In one mouse of each strain, a small, single focus of fibrinoid vascular necrosis was observed. Overall, there was no significant myocardial necrosis, atrophy or inflammation. Picrosirius red staining revealed no evidence of fibrosis in any mouse. Dosimetric verification indicated that the irradiation was successful and delivered as planned, with an average predicted-to-measured dose-difference within 5%. While this study did not demonstrate significant arrhythmogenesis, certain modifications of the experimental mouse irradiation procedures are discussed which may enable more translationally relevant modelling of the canine cardiac response to SBRT-like irradiation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Models, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feasibility Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred C57BL</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myocardium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Jining Grey goat is one of the most prolific goat breeds in China, it is an important goat breed for the rural economy. ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) and ADAMTS1 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif) are essential for animal reproduction. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ASMT and ADAMTS1 genes in the highly prolific breed (Jining Grey goats), medium prolific breed (Boer goats and Guizhou White goats) and low prolific breeds (Angora goats, Liaoning Cashmere goats and Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats) were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Two SNPs (g.158122T&gt;C, g.158700G&gt;A) of ASMT gene and two SNPs (g.7979798A&gt;G, g.7979477C&gt;T) of ADAMTS1 gene were identified. For g.158122T&gt;C of ASMT gene, further analysis revealed that genotype TC or CC had 0.66 (p &lt; 0.05) or 0.75 (p &lt; 0.05) kids more than those with genotype TT in Jining Grey goats. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found in litter size between TC and CC genotypes. The SNP (g.158122T&gt;C) caused a p.Tyr298His change and this SNP mutation resulted in changes in protein binding sites and macromolecule-binding sites. The improvement in reproductive performance may be due to changes in the structure of ASMT protein. For g.7979477C&gt;T of ADAMTS1 gene, Jining Grey does with genotype CT or TT had 0.82 (p &lt; 0.05) or 0.86 (p &lt; 0.05) more kids than those with genotype CC. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found in litter size between CT or TT genotypes. These results preliminarily indicated that C allele (g.158122T&gt;C) of ASMT gene and T allele (g.7979477C&gt;T) of ADAMTS1 gene are potential molecular markers which could improve litter size of Jining Grey goats and be used in goat breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>ADAMTS1 Protein</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Acetylserotonin O-Methyltransferase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Litter Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 299 cattle (Holstein, Montbeliard, Fleckvieh and crossbred animals) with clinical signs were included in this study. A total of 171 animals were found positive for at least one pathogen by Giemsa-stained blood smears examination Theileria annulata (136/299, 45.5%), Babesia bovis (14/299, 4.7%), B. bigemina (3/299, 1.0%) and Anaplasma marginale (12/299, 4.0%) were identified. Six animals were co-infected by T. annulata and A. marginale. Although no ticks were collected from diseased animals, clinical signs in cattle were hyperthermia (120/136, 88.3%), gluttony followed by anorexia (113/136, 83.1%), lymph node enlargement (99/136, 72.8%), anaemia (82/136, 60.3%), icterus (58/136, 42.6%) and haemoglobinuria (36/136, 26.5%). Gluttony followed by anorexia was considered highly suggestive of an incubation of tropical theileriosis as shown by a higher receptivity index (IR = 0.89-1). This clinical sign is evident in young Montbeliard and young Holstein males with anaemia (IR = 1) and icterus (IR = 0.78-0.81) which is earlier than haemoglobinuria (IR = 0.51-0.54). The incidence of T. annulata was maximum in July (n = 57), as well as B. bovis (n = 6) and A. marginale (n = 13). These results highlight the preponderance of tropical theileriosis in north-central Algeria, where gluttony followed by anorexia is probably a prodromal symptom during the incubation period of the disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Algeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anaplasmosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Theileriasis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In Italy, among rodents, Hystrix cristata (crested porcupine) is the largest species and it is distributed all over the country. In this paper, the isolation and characterization of pathogenic Leptospira spp. from the kidney of H. cristata is reported for the first time. During Autumn 2018, Leptospira detection by real-time PCR and isolation were performed from kidneys of two died female porcupines (an adult and a porcupette). Only for porcupette kidney sample, real-time PCR for pathogenic Leptospira tested positive. The isolated strain was identified as Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona serovar Pomona, using the three schemes of multilocus sequence typing. The results show that H. cristata could be a Leptospira host. The infection of serovars Pomona could be related to the habitat shared with wild boar, a typical reservoir host for this serovar.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leptospirosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcupines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, persistent neutrophil activity and delayed apoptosis can be harmful to surrounding tissues; this problem occurs in diverse inflammatory diseases, including asthma-affected horses. Previous studies in horses with acute lung inflammation indicated that treatment with tamoxifen (TX), a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, produces a significant decrease in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophil content. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tamoxifen and its metabolites (N-desmethyltamoxifen and endoxifen) on the mitochondrial membrane potential assay by flow cytometry, and the activation of effector caspase-3 through immunoblotting, in peripheral blood neutrophils obtained from healthy horses (n = 5). Results show that tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen and endoxifen depolarize the mitochondrial membrane and activate caspase-3 in healthy equine neutrophils in vitro. These findings suggest that tamoxifen and its metabolites may activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in equine neutrophils. However, more studies are necessary to further explore the signalling pathways of these drugs in the induction of apoptosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Asthmatic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Caspase 3</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flow Cytometry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity, Innate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoblotting</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitochondrial Membranes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutrophils</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tamoxifen</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The disease is likely to be endemic in Tanzania and little is reported on molecular characterization of Brucella species in pastoral settings. This study aimed at characterizing Brucella species (targeting genus Brucella) infecting humans, cattle and goat in Kagera region (Ngara and Karagwe districts) using real-time PCR, PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes and Sanger sequencing. Brucella spp. were detected in 47 samples (19 sera and 28 milk) out of 125 samples (77 sera, 35 milk and 13 aborted materials) using real-time PCR. All aborted materials (13 samples) were negative to real-time PCR. Out of the 47 real-time PCR positive samples (28 milk and 19 sera), 20 samples (10 milk and 10 sera) showed an expected 16S rRNA gene PCR product. Sequence analysis and blasting confirmed the presence of Brucella spp. in pastoral areas of Kagera region. The Brucella spp. from Kagera were phylogenetically grouped in two clades and three branches all closer to B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis from USA, Sudan and Iran. However, they were distinct from other species isolated also in USA, New Zealand, Germany and Egypt. This was expected based on the distance between the geographical regions from which the data (nucleotides sequences from 16S gene sequencing) for the phylogeny reconstruction were obtained. This is the first study to report Brucella species identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in East and Central Africa. A livestock vaccination program re-inforced with a high index of Brucella diagnosis is needed to eradicate brucellosis in animals and minimize suffering from Brucella infections in humans in Tanzania.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aborted Fetus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tanzania</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32567811</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Utility assessment of an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of subclinical cases of caseous lymphadenitis in small ruminant flocks.</Title>	<Abstract>The actual prevalence of CLA (caseous lymphadenitis) in small ruminant flocks is underestimated in many countries, and because it is not a notifiable disease, it will continue to spread without data and information about its real economic impact. The difficulty in the accurate identification of the causative agent in internal subclinical cases allows the disease to spread within and between flocks. This research intends to assess the utility of an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test in the detection of internal subclinical cases of CLA in farms and to simultaneously add data on the seroprevalence of the disease in Portugal. Sera from 756 small ruminants, 70% sheep (528/756) and 30% goats (228/756) were screened for antibodies against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis using the ELISA technique based on a recombinant phospholipase D (ELITEST CLA # CK105A[&#174;]). The animals showing internal lesions (n &#42890; 58) were sampled for the identification of the aetiological agent. In this investigation, the prevalence of CLA was 34% (258/756), with the ELISA test showing a low specificity (78%) and high sensitivity (100%). The proof was able to detect 57% (13/23) of subclinical cases of CLA confirmed by postmortem examination and conventional PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The results also reveal that goats have a higher propensity for the disease, and dairy farms and non-extensive production units appear to be more susceptible to CLA. This research clarifies an actual problem and pointed out the importance of CLA in small ruminant herds in Portugal. Finally seems to demonstrate that the ELISA test is a good diagnostic tool for use in CLA eradication programmes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Asymptomatic Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphadenitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portugal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Only three reports exist that describe a tetralogy of Fallot in adult horses. Whereas in humans the presence of congenital heart disease constitutes a risk factor for developing aortic aneurysms, their association has never been reported in horses. Here, we present a case with a large ascending aortic aneurysm as a complication of a tetralogy of Fallot in an adult mare. The mare was referred with sustained tachycardia and a 5 days history of mild intermittent colic, depression, inappetence and weight loss. Echocardiography was used to characterize the cardiac abnormalities and aortic root dilation. Due to the poor prognosis, the mare was euthanized and post-mortem examination further characterized the abnormalities. At least four factors contributed in this case to the development of aortic haematoma: congenital disease, mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation vasa vasorum dysfunction and inflammatory/degenerative lesions in the aorta's intima. Although colic is primarily caused by gastrointestinal issues, cardiac disease should be suspected in cases with sustained tachycardia, even in absence of murmurs or arrhythmias. Despite the fact that congenital abnormalities are usually detected in foals, they may sometimes remain unnoticed for several years.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aortic Aneurysm</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tetralogy of Fallot</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To investigate the mixed infection incidence of wild-type pseudorabies virus (WT PRV) and respiratory bacteria, a total of 1,293 clinical samples were collected from pigs with typical respiratory signs from 14 different provinces of China from September 2016 to February 2018. The WT PRV was detected by ELISA targeting gE antibody while the bacteria were detected by bacterial isolation and serotyping by PCR. The results revealed that the detection rate of A. pleuropneumoniae and B. bronchiseptica infection associated with WT PRV infection were 6.30% and 15.99%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those without WT PRV infection (3.41% and 4.41%) at the farm level (p &lt; .05). There were no significant differences in the detection rate of H. parasuis, S. suis or P. multocida between WT PRV positive and negative farms (p &gt; .05). However, the detection rate of attenuated H. parasuis and S. suis strains were 68.19% and 64.75%, respectively, in WT PRV infected farms, which were significantly higher than those (41.56% and 52.25%) in WT PRV free farms (p &lt; .05). The prevalent serotypes of H. parasuis-5/12 and S. suis-2 were also investigated by multiplex PCR. These results indicated that the presence of WT PRV increased the chance of bacterial infection and the number of pathogenic strains in the respiratory system of pigs. Therefore, the eradication of pseudorabies is an effective approach to prevent and control the bacterial respiratory diseases in the intensive pig farms in China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coinfection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesvirus 1, Suid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pseudorabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Tract Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In light of the fact that Cortex phellodendri has long been used to treat diarrhoea in China, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Cortex Phellodendri Extract (CPE) on diarrhoea in weaning piglets and the mechanism behind such effects. In the first trial, 36 diarrhoeal weaning piglets were randomly divided into three groups. The control group was injected with 20 mg oxytetracycline/kg BW, while the two treatment groups were orally administered with 10 mg and 20 mg CPE/kg BW respectively. In the second trial, 96 weaning piglets were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was fed basal diet, while 300 mg CPE/kg BW was added to the diet of the treatment group. The pathogenic bacteria were then isolated and identified from the diarrhoeal faecal samples. Cell adhesion and RT-PCR tests were used to investigate the effect of CPE on the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to IPEC-J2 cells. 16S rDNA-based high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse faecal microflora. The results showed that CPE reduced the diarrhoea incidence rate (p &lt; 0.05) and diarrhoea index (p &lt; 0.05) compared to control group, and increased the richness and evenness of weaning piglets' gut microbiota. Escherichia coli (E. coil) was identified as the causative organism. Cell adhesion and RT-PCR tests suggested that CPE reduced the adhesion of E. coli to IPEC-J2 cells (p &lt; 0.05) and the expression of fae and faeG gene (p &lt; 0.05) responsible for encoding E. coli fimbriae protein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diarrhea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drugs, Chinese Herbal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxytetracycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weaning</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this trial was to study phenotypic variability of four local sheep breeds and strains to abomasum nematodes infection and to Babesia/Theileria parasites. Faeces, blood and abomasum contents were collected from 310 sheep slaughtered in eight commercial slaughterhouses across North Tunisia. Haematological and biochemical parameters were assessed. DNA was extracted and catch-all primers were used to detect both Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. DNA. Faecal egg counts (FEC) was quantitatively assessed using simple flotation technique followed by McMaster technique. Male and female worms were collected from all abomasum contents and counted under a stereomicroscope. The percentage of faeces samples positive for GIN's eggs was 30.82%. After worms' recovery, the infection prevalence was estimated to 75.90%. The overall infection prevalence by Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. was 4.21%. The dispersion of observations plots obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) showed two clusters of individuals. The first cluster contains animals having positive Babesia/Theileria PCR, presence of nematodes in the abomasum contents and relatively low total worm count (TWC &lt; 500) expect one animal which was found bearing high TWC (&gt;500). In this same group, with a suspected form of resistance, animals showed normal values of albumin and normal haematological parameters (red blood cell count [RBC], haemoglobin [Hb] and packed cell volume [PCV]). The second cluster represents all the other observations in which subgroups of animals were distinguished on the basis of their potential resistance to abomasum nematodes. Multiple correlations showed significant positive correlations between RBC/Hb, RBC/PCV, PCV/Hb and FEC/TWC. Significant negative correlations were observed between TWC/RBC and TWC/Hb. It is concluded that the phenotypic variability among local sheep breeds is essential for more advanced genetic and genomic studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abomasum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biological Variation, Individual</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Individuality</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nematoda</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nematode Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Theileria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Theileriasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tunisia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In all, 30 male yaks (3-year old and 114.57 &#177; 21.56 kg of body weight) were allocated to one of three isonitrogenous dietary treatments that had different Nemf concentrations (low 3.72 MJ/kg, middle 4.52 MJ/kg and high 5.32 MJ/kg, respectively). The yaks were fed for 120 days. The results showed that the final weight, average daily gain, dressing percentage, backfat thickness and loin muscle area were significantly improved (p &lt; .05) with the increase in dietary energy concentration. However, an opposite trend of feed:gain ratio, cooking loss, driage, shear force and moisture content was found. A significant improvement (p &lt; .05) of intramuscular fat content was observed in the high-energy group. Additionally, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid was increased (p &lt; .05) at the expense of the saturated fatty acids. The mRNA expressions of lipogenic genes fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947;, lipoprotein lipase and heart fatty acid-binding proteins increased (p &lt; .05) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mRNA expressions of lipolytic genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase correspondingly decreased (p &lt; .05) with increased dietary energy level. In summary, the growth performance, meat production and meat quality improvement of finishing yaks can be achieved by increasing the dietary energy concentration. The intramuscular fat accumulation of yaks was achieved through up-regulation of intramuscular lipogenic gene expression as well as fatty acid transport gene expression and down-regulation of lipolytic gene expression by promoting dietary energy concentration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipogenesis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Virus monitoring among the sheep and cattle herds is usually done by vaccination. Inactivated virus vaccines can partially protect the livestock from viral challenge. However, vaccinated animals are likely to be infected. So, there is an essential need for producing vaccine by other methods. Gp60 SU, encoded by Env gene, is the surface glycoprotein of BLV detected to be the major target for the host immunity against the virus. Different stages were performed to predict the potential B and T-helper cell epitopes. The general framework of the method includes retrieving the amino acid sequence of gp60 SU, conducting the sequence alignment, getting the entropy plot, retrieving the previously found epitopes, predicting the hydropathy parameters, modelling the tertiary structure of the glycoprotein, minimizing the structure energy, validating the model by Ramachandran plot, predicting the linear and discontinuous epitopes by various servers and eventually choosing the consensus immunogenic regions. Ramachandran plot scrutiny has demonstrated that the modelled prediction is accurate and suitable. By surveying overlaps of various results, 4 and 2 immunogenic regions were selected as linear and conformational epitopes respectively. Amino acids 35-53, 67-97, 288-302 and 410-421 and those of numbers 37-58 and 72-100 were the regions selected as linear and conformational epitopes respectively. The tertiary structure of the final epitope was modelled as well. A comparison of the predicted epitopes structure with that of gp60 SU envelope, illustrated that the tertiary structure of these epitopes does not change after being separated from the primary complete one. The present achievements will lead to a better interpretation of the antigen-antibody interactions against gp60 in the designing process of safe and efficient vaccines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Antigens, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Computer Simulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia Virus, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Usually, it is detected in outbreaks of respiratory disease, most often during the winter period. During the middle of October 2018, a serious outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in a cattle farm comprising about 300 heads located in Central Italy. The herd was affected by a severe flu-like syndrome unresponsive to any antibiotic treatment. Within 3 weeks, 39 adult animals died, and 12 abortions occurred. Direct and indirect laboratory tests were performed to detect the main pathogens causing the respiratory disease of the affected cattle. The results of laboratory investigations provided evidence of an acute and severe BRSV syndrome characterized by unusual mortality. In order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of this syndrome, phylogenetic analysis of the BRSV strain detected from the outbreak was carried out. The sequence analysis showed that the strain was genetically divergent from BRSV strains previously identified in Italy, as it showed high sequence similarity of more than 97% with strains isolated during a major BRSV epizootic that occurred in Sweden, Norway and Denmark during 2010-2011. The infection of the herd in Italy with this BRSV strain was likely due to the introduction of animals imported into Italy from abroad.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dairying</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Italy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ten ejaculates were collected each from four healthy stallions and cryopreserved using HF-20 freezing extender containing either 0 mg/ml cysteine or ascorbic acid, 0.5 mg/ml cysteine and 0.5 mg/ml ascorbic acid. All samples in freezing extender containing cysteine or ascorbic acid or none of them were assessed for sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, morphology and enzymes concentration. The ALP, LDH and GGT were significantly higher in 0-group compared with cysteine and ascorbic acid groups. The sperm motility of frozen-thawed semen with 0-group was significantly better compared with cysteine and ascorbic acid groups. The variation on viability, sperm membrane integrity and morphology were insignificant between all treated groups. Therefore, these enzymes were reduced when using antioxidants in the freezing extender.

We had previously estimated the prevalence of Salmonella shedding among shelter dogs throughout Texas using a repeated cross-sectional study design. Our current objectives were to fully characterize the Salmonella isolates and to assess their relatedness, using whole-genome sequencing. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were detected in 4/27 (15%) of the isolates. The fosfomycin resistance gene fosA7 was identified in two isolates; to our knowledge, there are no published reports of this gene in canine Salmonella isolates. The biocide resistance gene qacEdelta1, conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, was detected in an isolate that had four additional AMR genes. The most frequently identified serotypes were Newport (6/27, 22%) and Javiana (4/27, 15%), both of which were widespread among animal shelters. For these serotypes, there was evidence of both transmission of Salmonella within the shelter environment and separate introductions of Salmonella into a shelter. Several canine Salmonella isolates were closely related to human clinical isolates (four canine isolates within 10 SNPs and six more within 20 SNPs), suggesting a shared pathogen population. Educational outreach programmes targeting animal shelter workers would be useful for optimizing knowledge of Salmonella and other canine-associated zoonotic pathogens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Shedding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Infections, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella enterica</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Texas</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Whole Genome Sequencing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Weight measurement is the simplest way to monitor the development of the puppies, and a weight loss during the first 48 hr has been recognized as one of the factors that puts puppies at a higher risk of neonatal mortality. However, little is known about what constitutes optimum growth up to 3 weeks. In this study, a mathematical formula with the form P = P0 exp (0.13084 x - 0.001616 x[2]), where P is weight on Day x and P0 is weight on Day 0, obtained by multiple linear regression, is presented and validated with data from 345 puppies belonging to 60 litters of 19 different breeds, from toy to giant size, showing that it appropriately describes maximum puppy growth rate during the neonatal period for all breeds. This formula is in agreement with previous studies and generic recommendations that can be found in the literature on puppy growth from birth to 21 days regarding relative daily weight gain. It can be easily introduced in a spreadsheet or used to build growth charts that can help the breeder or the veterinarian in monitoring and evaluating puppy growth during the neonatal period. Although deviations from the maximum growth rate can now be quantified, there is still a need to determine the limits beyond which supplementary feeding is advised/required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Models, Biological</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Nevertheless, there are very few reports on the characterization of redox biomarkers and mitochondrial function in the goat testis. Therefore, in this study we studied the markers of oxidative stress and mitochondrial functions in the goat testis during the process of ageing. Alterations in the markers of oxidative stress/redox biomarkers (contents of reactive oxygen species, nitrite, lipid peroxide, protein carbonyl, glutathione and activities of glutathione peroxidase, monoamine oxidase) and mitochondrial function (Complex-I and Complex-IV activities) were elucidated during the process of ageing. Augmented oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial function were prominent during ageing in the goat testis. Ageing can lead to induction of oxidative stress and decreased production of ATP; however, the prooxidants generated must be effectively removed from the body by the innate antioxidant defence system to minimize the damage to the host tissue. Conversely, the antioxidants cannot completely scavenge the excessive amount of reactive oxygen species produced during ageing or pathological conditions leading to significant cell death and tissue damage. Thus, the use of effective and potent antioxidants in the feed could significantly reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial function, resulting in enriched goat health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitochondria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In the present study, we systematically reviewed existing literature on the prevalence of endo- and ectoparasites of equines in Iran. Major electronic databases, including PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scientific Information Database (SID), were searched (Last updated 11/05/2018) for relevant literature of parasites that have been identified from equines in Iran. Of the 1809 titles produced by bibliographic search, 38 were included in the review. Twenty-seven of the studies were on horses, six on donkeys, three on both horses and donkeys, and one study was on both horses and mules. Furthermore, 24 of the studies reported infections caused by protozoa, thirteen by helminths, two by ectoparasites, and one by both protozoa and helminths. The overall pooled prevalence of parasitic infection was 28.8% (95%CI: 22.9-35.7, I[2] = 93.4%). Helminths were the most prevalent parasites 46.7% (95% CI: 24.1-70.7, I[2] = 96.0%). Furthermore, donkeys were the most affected equine, with a prevalence of 70.7% (95% CI: 53.2-83.7, I[2] = 92.5%). The protozoa frequently reported included nine species belonging to the genera: Neospora, Toxoplasma, Theileria, Babesia and Eimeria. Also, the helminths frequently reported included 21 species belonging to the genera: Strongylus, Dicrocoelium, Oxyuris, Habronema, Echinococcus, Dictyocaulus, Cyathostomum, Probstmayria, Anoplocephala, Setaria and Fasciola. Ticks were the only ectoparasites frequently reported. Parasitic fly species of the genera Gasterophilus were also reported. The study-level risk of bias was likely to be high because of differences in study design. Parasitic infections of equines in Iran are frequent and caused by a diversity of parasites, which threatens the health and well-being of these animals. Further research is needed in the area to identify the risk factors of infection for effective control of the parasites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ectoparasitic Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Helminthiasis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protozoan Infections, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Surgery is the only effective treatment for cMGT, and dogs with metastasis at the time of diagnosis or those diagnosed at an advanced stage have poorer prognosis. Thus, novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are needed. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1 receptor) is involved in cancer progression and has been detected in various malignant tumours including breast cancer in humans. Furthermore, NK-1 receptor antagonists inhibit cancer progression. We evaluated NK-1 receptor expression in malignant and benign cMGT compared with that in normal mammary gland tissues and analysed the relationship between the expression of NK-1 receptor and histopathological type or malignancy grade. Specimens from 34 malignant MGT and 35 benign MGT cases were used for immunohistochemistry and scored according to intensity and percentage. Healthy margins from each tumour were used as internal controls. The scores for NK-1 receptor intensity, percentage of positive cells and overall immunohistochemistry were higher in malignant MGT than in benign MGT and normal tissue (p &lt; .000). NK-1 receptor expression was not correlated with either malignancy grade or histopathological type. Expression of the NK-1 receptor in malignant MGT was higher than that in benign MGT and normal tissues. Thus, NK-1 receptor could be considered a novel therapeutic target for cMGT. Further studies using other quantitative tests such as western blotting or PCR and the evaluation of substance P in patient tumour tissue or serum are needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers, Tumor</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Grading</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptors, Neurokinin-1</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Feed intake, growth performance, ruminal fermentation parameters and the ruminal microbial community were measured the during experiment period. Results showed no differences in growth performance and feed intake between the two species in sucking period; however, the feed/gain ratio (F/G) of the water buffalo was higher than that of Holstein calve (p &gt; 0.05). After weaning, the intake of starter by the Holstein calf was higher while intake of grass by the water buffalo was higher resulting in higher growth performance of and a lower F/G ratio for Holstein (p &lt; 0.05). The rumen of Holstein calf showed higher levels of propionate, lower levels of acetate and branched-chain fatty acids than that of water buffalo during both periods (p &lt; 0.05). The rumen of water buffalo showed a higher number of observed bacterial species and Shannon diversity as compared with that of Holstein calf. The members belonging to the bacterial phylum Bacteroides and genus Prevotella in the rumen of Holstein calf were higher (p &lt; 0.05), while Firmicutes and fibrolytic bacteria Ruminobacter and Ruminococcus were lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of water buffalo.

To evaluate the effects of transport stress on heat shock protein (HSPs) expression on goat primary parenchymatous organs, a total of three batches of goats were treated in this study. For each batch, 12 healthy adult male goats were randomly and averagely divided into three groups: Control group (non-transported group), 2 hr transported group and 6 hr transported group. Real-time PCR results indicated that the mRNA expression level of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in all examined organs of 2 hr transport-treated goats were upregulated (p &lt; .05) except lung, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70; except spleen) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90; except liver and lung) were also increased (p &lt; .05). In 6 hr transported group, the transcription levels of HSP27 (except heart and kidney), HSP70 (except heart, liver and lymph nodes) and HSP90 (except heart and spleen) were all backed to the original levels or even reduced (p &lt; .05). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that the protein levels of HSP27 (except lymph nodes), HSP70 (except spleen) and HSP90 (except liver and lung) were all increased after 2 hr transport (p &lt; .05). After 6 hr transport, HSP27 only in kidney and HSP70 only in heart and liver were upregulated (p &lt; .05), while HSP90 in all the examined organs except liver and lung were also maintained in relatively high levels (p &lt; .05). Taken together, these results suggested that the expression of HSPs in goat primary parenchymatous organs may be regulated by transport stress time. Moreover, this study also provides some new data to advocate reducing transport stress of goats and improving animal welfare.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Profiling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stress, Physiological</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 24 weaning pigs (Landrace &#215; Yorkshire &#215; Duroc; average body weight = 8.55 &#177; 0.68 kg&#65307;weaning at 28 days) were selected and randomly divided into four groups (six replicates in each group). The piglets were exposed to hydrogen sulphide (0, 5, 10 and 15 mg/m[3]) during the experiment period, which lasted 28 days in four controlled environmental chambers. The results showed that exposure to hydrogen sulphide reduced the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and increased the diarrhoea rate of piglets. Hydrogen sulphide could increase the abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiota. The abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased and Bacteroides decreased in the treatment groups. Five biomarkers, such as Eubacterium_1coprostanoligenes, Clostridiales, Phascolarctobacterium, Acidaminococcaceae and Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 were selected by Lefse analysis. Our results reveal that hydrogen sulphide damaged the growth performance and destroyed the microbial bacteria balance of weaning pigs. The concentrations of hydrogen sulphide should fall below 5 mg/m[3] .</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cecum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Microbiome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrogen Sulfide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weaning</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The main objective of the study was to determine the types and prevalence of intestinal parasites in baboons and warthogs in the Mole National Park. A total of nineteen (19) and twenty-three (23) samples were collected from the baboons and warthogs, respectively, and examined using the direct saline smear and formol-ether concentration technique for the identification of cysts, eggs and larvae of parasites. The survey showed that 94.74% of the baboon samples examined was infected with at least one parasite, whereas that of the warthogs showed 95.65% prevalence. A total of seven (7) and eight (8) different parasites were identified in baboon and warthog faecal samples, respectively. Strongyloides sp. had the highest prevalence in baboons (84.21%) and warthogs (78.26%). The second prevalent parasite identified was Ascaris sp. in the baboons (31.58%) and warthogs (30.43%). The results showed a high level of multiparasitism in these wild animals and an increased risk of zoonotic transmission which may result from interaction with inhabitants of the park community.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ghana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Monkey Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Papio anubis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parks, Recreational</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The 1.98-m-long shark exhibited advanced cachexia with its total weight (19.0 kg) and liver weight (0.37 kg) reduced by 60% and 89%, respectively, compared with a healthy individual of the same length. Marked tissue decomposition was evident preventing histopathology and identification of a definitive cause of death. At necropsy, the abdominal organs were abnormally displaced and showed marked reductions in size compared with a healthy individual of the same size. Importantly, a hook-shaped enterolith (HSE), with a rough surface and cream in colour, was found within the spiral valve of the intestine and is to the authors' knowledge, the first description of such in any marine animal. X-ray diffractometry showed that the HSE comprised the minerals monohydrocalcite (Ca[CO3].H2O; ~70 wt%) and struvite (Mg [NH4 ] [PO4 ]. [H2 O]6 ; ~30 wt%). A CT scan showed concentric lamellate concretions around a 7/o offset J-hook that formed the nidus of the HSE. Nylon fishing line attached to the hook exited the HSE and was evident in the abdominal cavity through a perforation in the intestinal wall where the posterior intestinal artery merges. The most parsimonious reconstruction of events leading to enterolithiasis and secondary cachexia in this shark was the consumption of a hooked fish and subsequent hook migration causing perforations of the cardiac stomach wall followed by the thin, muscular wall of the apposed, sub-adjacent intestine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cachexia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calculi</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fish Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>New South Wales</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sharks</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study was conducted to characterize the pathology of natural cases of CSF in northern Vietnam in 2018 and their genetic prevalence. A total of 10 representative pigs were collected from four provinces (Hung Yen, Ha Noi, Quang Ninh and Thai Binh) during five outbreaks and examined pathologically. The gross and histopathological findings showed the disease was expressed as the acute or the subacute to chronic form of CSF, depending on the age of the animals. The most consistently observed lesions associated with infection by the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) included lymphoid depletions in tonsils, lymph node and spleen; histiocytic hyperplasia in spleen; cerebral haemorrhage; perivascular cuffing in the brain; renal erythrodiapedesis; urothelial vacuolation and degeneration and interstitial pneumonia. The immunohistochemical findings showed a ubiquitous CSFV antigen mainly in the monocytes/macrophages and in the epithelial and endothelial cells in various organs. CSFV neurotropism was also found in the small neurons of the cerebrum and the ganglia of the myenteric plexus. Analysis of the full-length envelope protein (E2) genome sequence showed that all strains were genetically clustered into subgenotype 2.5, sharing a nucleotide identity of 94.0%-100.00%. Based on the results of this study, the strain was categorized as a moderately virulent CSFV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Classical Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Classical Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vietnam</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our objective was to conduct a large-scale study to investigate the sero-epidemiology of C. burnetii in domestic ruminants throughout the most of Greek regions. We tested serum samples obtained from goats, sheep and bovines from different regions of Greece. All sera were tested for C. burnetii IgG antibodies by a commercial ELISA according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We tested 1,173 goats and sheep obtained from 177 different herds and totally 194 (17%) animals from 78 (44%) herds were positive for C. burnetii. Positive animals were present in seven (88%) different regions and seropositivity varied widely among these regions. The highest percentage was observed in Peloponnese (44%), where all the tested herds presented animals with C. burnetii antibodies. &#921;n all Aegean Islands except the island of Limnos we detected goats and sheep positive for C. burnetii with seroposivity varying between 2% in Kos to 37% in Rhodes. Finally, in 22 (85%) Greek prefectures we found C. burnetii IgG-positive animals whereas in 14 (54%) prefectures more than 50% of tested herds had seropositive animals. We also tested 28 cows from five different herds in Macedonia and Aegean Islands and six (21%) of them, obtained from two (40%) herds were positive. Considering the importance of C. burnetii for public health, our data reflect the lack of awareness by veterinarians, physicians and competent authorities as we provide evidence of C. burnetii seropositivity in productive animals throughout the most of Greek territories. Due to the increased risk of inhalation of the bacterium by people who entered the affected farms we raise the question of Q fever emergence in Greece.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Greece</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aetiology of the disease is not known in detail but is likely multi-factorial. One important factor may be inhaled dust which carries harmful substances which may be bioactivated and thus can lead to local inflammation in the airways. The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression and protein localisation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferases (GST) involved in bioactivation and detoxification of harmful substances in lungs of horses with or without histological evidence of lower airway inflammation. Significantly lower gene expression of CYP2A13 and GSTM1 was observed in lungs from horses with histological evidence of lower airway inflammation compared with horses without. A higher expression, although not significant, was found for CYP1A1 in horses with histological evidence of lower airway inflammation. There were no differences in gene expression of GSTP1 and SOD3. The proteins were localised in the respiratory epithelium which is of relevance as a defence to local exposure of inhaled harmful substances. In conclusion, our study reports differential gene expression of enzymes involved in bioactivation and detoxification of foreign substances in the lungs of horses with histological evidence of lower airway inflammation compared with horses without.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Asthma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Xenobiotics</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 4-year-old Holstein bull presented decreased appetite, dry cough, progressive weight loss, sternal recumbence and reluctance to stand and move. Laboratory tests revealed leucocytosis (18.4 &#215; 10[3] /&#956;l) accompanied by neutrophilia (10.48 &#215; 10[3] /&#956;l), and monocytosis (1.28 &#215; 10[3] /&#956;l), hyperglobulinaemia (6.3 g/dl), hypoalbuminaemia (1.5 g/dl), hyperfibrinogenaemia (10 g/L) and severe increase in gamma-glutamyl transferase activity (1,216 U/L). Reticular ultrasonographical examination showed a large amount of hyperechoic and hypoechoic content between the reticular serosa and the hepatic visceral surface. The main gross findings included fibrin deposition and adhesions between the reticulum, liver and diaphragm surfaces; a 4.0 mm in diameter transmural reticular perforation; a 12.0-cm diameter and scarce small randomly abscesses in the liver's parenchyma. The lungs presented multifocal areas of suppurative embolic foci (pulmonary abscesses), interstitial emphysema and multifocal fibrin deposition on the pleural surface.

To investigate the effects of dietary NAC supplementation on the reproductive performance of goats, the reproductive performance and endometrial transcriptome of goats fed with diets with NAC (NAC group) and without NAC supplementation (control group) were compared. Results showed that the goats fed with 0.03% and 0.05% NAC had similar litter size, birth weight, nitric oxide (NO), sex hormones and amino acids levels compared with the goats of the control group. However, feeding with 0.07% NAC supplementation from day 0 to day 30 of gestation remarkably increased the litter size of goats. The goats of the 0.07% NAC group presented increased levels of NO relative to the control group, but their sex hormones and amino acids showed no differences. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the endometrium between the control and the 0.07% NAC groups. These DEGs included 146 upregulated genes and 61 downregulated genes in the 0.07% NAC group. They were primarily involved in the cellular response to toxic substances, oxidoreductase activity, immune receptor activity, signalling receptor binding, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt signalling pathway and PPAR signalling pathway. In conclusion, results showed that dietary 0.07% NAC supplementation exerted a beneficial effect on the survival of goat embryos at the early pregnancy stage. Such positive outcome might be due to the increased NO production and affected expression of genes involved in the anti-inflammation pathways of the endometrium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acetylcysteine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Base Sequence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Free Radical Scavengers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

As common viral vertebrate hosts, birds and horses deserve special attention with routine serological surveillance. Here, we estimated the seroprevalence of WNV, USUV and TBEV in 160 migrating/resident birds and 60 horses sampled in Mazandaran, Golestan, North Khorasan, Kordestan provinces and Golestan province of Iran respectively. ELISA results showed that of 220 collected samples, 32 samples (14.54%), including 22 birds and 10 horses, were positive. Microsphere immunoassay results showed that 16.7% (10/60) of horse blood samples collected in Golestan province were seropositive against WNV (7; 11.7%), Flavivirus (2; 3.3%) and seropositive for USUV or WNV (1; 1.7%). Furthermore, micro virus neutralization tests revealed that four of seven ELISA-positive bird blood samples were seropositive against WNV: two Egyptian vultures, and one long-legged buzzard collected in Golestan province as well as a golden eagle collected in North Khorasan province. No evidence of seropositivity with TBEV was observed in collected samples. We showed that WNV, responsible for neuroinvasive infection in vertebrates, is circulating among birds and horses in Iran, recommending a sustained surveillance of viral infections in animals, and anticipating future infections in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>West Nile Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>West Nile virus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two sets of samples (aborted fetuses' organs, placental tissues, aborted cows blood) were submitted for laboratory investigations at the Tifton Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia (TVDIL, Tifton, GA, USA). An abortion panel testing for the major abortion-causing agents [e.g. Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis Virus/ Bovine Herpes Virus-I (IBR/ BHV-I), Brucella spp., Leptospira spp.] was conducted on several of the samples. On the first set of samples, microbial cultures, serology and PCR tests for the common abortifacient agents revealed the presence of Neospora caninum (N. caninum) DNA, which was positive by PCR on the placenta and fetal tissues. The second set of diagnostic investigations also identified two out of three submitted freshly aborted fetuses to be positive for N. caninum by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, all three dams were also sero-positive for N. caninum. The entire herd was being fed on grass silage harvested from a pasture where feral pigs were hunted previously and carcasses were left behind. As a consequence of this action a large population of wild coyotes were attracted to these carcasses, and likely contaminated the pasture with potential N. caninum-infected feces. After the abortion outbreak was resolved, it was recommended that the farmers should avoid disposal of cadavers of hunted animals in the wild, as it could attract carnivorous and omnivorous animals that may potentially spread the disease to the cattle and other wildlife.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abortion, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coccidiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dairying</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Georgia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neospora</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, there is a paucity of such surveillance in communal farming areas in South Africa. This study investigated knowledge and antimicrobial use practices by cattle farmers and antimicrobial resistance levels of indicator bacteria in cattle in a rural communal farming area in South Africa. Seventy (70) farmers were interviewed at five cattle inspection sites using structured questionnaires. Rectal swabs were collected from apparently healthy cattle (n = 100) for culture of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using broth microdilution. The farmers indicated predominantly using tetracyclines. Although 42% of the farmers indicated hearing about antimicrobial resistance, none of them clearly understood what it involves. Seventy-nine (79) E. coli and 71 Enterococcus species were isolated with E. faecium being the dominant species among the Enterococcus isolates. E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin (16%; 13/79), chlortetracycline (8%; 6/79) and amoxicillin (8%; 6/79). Enterococcus isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin (55%; 39/71) and amoxycillin (3%; 2/71). We observed knowledge gaps in prudent antimicrobial use practices and antimicrobial resistance among the farmers. Farmer tailored education programmes on primary animal health care and prudent antimicrobial use practices must be developed and implemented to improve antimicrobial stewardship among farmers with limited veterinary supervision. The level of colistin resistance detected among E. coli isolates from rural communal cattle in this study was unexpected and warrants further molecular investigation to check if the resistance is plasmid mediated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enterococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>South Africa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Among other diagnostic tools, the seric CPSE has been studied and identified as a valid and specific biomarker for prostatic disorders, since it can result significantly more elevated in dogs affected by several prostatic abnormalities, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, bacterial prostatitis and prostatic carcinoma. Therefore, dosing CPSE in serum represents a new diagnostic and screening tool. Dosing CPSE in everyday clinical practice has three objectives: (a) the diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia; (b) the preventive screening of prostatic disorders in healthy dogs; (c) the medical follow-up in subjects with prostatic disorders during and after medical therapy. Neither circadian rhythms nor transrectal palpation performed during the andrological examination do affect CPSE. A sexual rest of at least 24 hr before dosing CPSE is recommended as it is affected by ejaculation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Andrology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnostic Tests, Routine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esterases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genital Neoplasms, Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Hyperplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, we downloaded 62 PEDV S gene sequences uploaded to GenBank, including 10 uploaded by our laboratory from 2018, and constructed a PEDV S gene evolution tree using MEGA V7.0 software. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the genogroup of PEDV in Sichuan Province was divided into three coexisting genogroups (GII-a, GII-b and GI-a), of them, GII-a has become the main genogroup in the province due to its prevalence and range of spread. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that there were amino acid insertions and deletions in the S protein encoded by the amplified S gene, and there were amino acid mutations in the COE and SS6 of the epitope in the amplified S protein. These results provide a basic research theory for understanding the prevalence of PEDV variation and controlling PED in Sichuan.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biological Evolution</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Molecular Epidemiology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Despite its extensive study in several species, there is a paucity of information about IGF-1`s function and localization in the canine ovary. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of IGF-1 on oocyte nuclear maturation and to immunolocalize the IGF-1 and its receptor (IGF-1R) in the ovary. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained from 34 bitches. The COCs from each bitch were incubated in TCM 199-HEPES in the absence (n = 199) or presence (n = 204) of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 96 hr at 38&#186;C in 5% CO2 , stained and evaluated for nuclear maturation by fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that the addition of IGF-1 did not have an effect (p &#707; 0.05) on the nuclear maturation under these conditions. The immunohistochemical study revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for IGF-1 and IGF-1R, respectively. Both were localized in all ovarian structures including the corpus luteum, but not in the granulosa cells from primordial follicles. In addition, IGF-1 was not localized in the oocytes in tertiary follicles. The results obtained show the presence of IGF-1 through the stages of follicular growth and in the corpus luteum of the canine ovary. However, its role on oocyte nuclear maturation could not be demonstrated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptor, IGF Type 1</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The rabbits of 5 weeks of age (body weight, 855 &#177; 5.53 g) were allotted into four groups (12 rabbits per group) and fed four experimental diets enriched with A. awamori at 0, 50, 100 and 150 mg per kg diet for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, an equal number of male APRI rabbits (3 months old; 4 groups, 5 rabbits per group) were housed in metabolism cages and fed the test diets for 14 days for the digestibility trial. All A. awamori-enriched diets induced a significant increase in the average body weight and weight gain of rabbits and significantly decreased the feed conversion ratio. In rabbits fed with A. awamori at 100 or 150 mg per kg diet, protein, lipid and fibber digestibility coefficients significantly increased compared with the control group. Intestinal villi measurements (length and thickness) were also enhanced in all rabbits fed with A. awamori. Adding A. awamori as a food supplement generally did not affect rabbit haematology and blood biochemistry values; however, at 150 mg per kg diet, it significantly increased the levels of haemoglobin and total protein, as well as red blood cell count. Furthermore, all enriched diets significantly increased rabbits' phagocytic activity and their phagocytic index. Rabbits fed with A. awamori also showed decreased malondialdehyde but increased catalase activity. In conclusion, A. awamori administered as feed supplement at 100-150 mg per kg of growing rabbits' diet enhances their growth, intestinal health and nutrient digestibility, and it raises the levels of their immune and antioxidative responses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aspergillus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutrients</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Probiotics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In dogs suffering from MCT, histamine receptor 1 (HR1) antagonists are frequently used to control mediator-related clinical symptoms. Previous studies have shown that the HR1 antagonists loratadine and terfenadine exert some growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MCs. We examined whether other HR1 antagonists used in clinical practice (desloratadine, rupatadine, cyproheptadine, dimetindene, diphenhydramine) affect proliferation and survival of neoplastic MCs. Furthermore, we analysed whether these HR1 antagonists counteract IgE-dependent histamine release from a MC line harbouring a functional IgE-receptor. HR1 antagonists were applied on two canine MC lines, C2 and NI-1, and on primary MCs obtained from three MCT samples. The HR1 antagonists desloratadine, rupatadine and cyproheptadine were found to be more potent in decreasing proliferation of C2 and NI-1 cells when compared with dimetindene and diphenhydramine. Similar effects were seen in primary neoplastic MCs, except for diphenhydramine, which exerted more potent growth-inhibitory effects than the other HR1 antagonists. Drug-induced growth-inhibition in C2 and NI-1 cells was accompanied by apoptosis. Loratadine, desloratadine and rupatadine also suppressed IgE-dependent histamine release in NI-1 cells. However, drug concentrations required to elicit substantial effects on growth or histamine release were relatively high (&gt;10 &#181;M). Therefore, it remains unknown whether these drugs or similar, more potent, HR1-targeting drugs can suppress growth or activation of canine neoplastic MCs in vivo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Proliferation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Histamine Antagonists</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Histamine Release</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mast Cells</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although goat and sheep are the primary hosts of PPR, studies have continuously reported the prevalence of circulating antibodies in large ruminants, which could bring a potential challenge to effectively control and eradicate PPR. In Nepal, seroprevalence of PPRV antibodies in cattle have not been monitored yet. To address this, a total of 255 cattle sera were collected from Rupandehi, Banke, Bara and Chitwan districts of Nepal where outbreak of PPR in small ruminants was reported previously. The sera samples were tested by competitive ELISA and the result indicated the prevalence of 5.88% PPRV antibodies in cattle which indicates the exposure of cattle to PPR virus. To make the disease control program effective, intensive monitoring of both domestic and wild animals is very important.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nepal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-Petits-Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

FFAR2 and FFAR3 mediate short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as signalling molecules. The present study aimed to give molecular characterization of FFAR2 and FFAR3 in the domestic cat. High homology with that in other mammals was revealed by cDNA cloning of cat FFAR2 FFAR3. We analyzed the tissue distribution of cat FFAR2 and FFAR3 mRNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The inhibition of intracellular cAMP concentrations was observed in cells transfected with cat FFAR2 or FFAR3 and treated with SCFAs. The activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells-luciferase reporter was only observed in cat FFAR2 transfected cells but not in FFAR3. Split luciferase assay (NanoLuc Binary Technology; NanoBiT) for FFAR2 or FFAR3 and Arrestin-3/&#946;-arrestin-2 revealed acetate-/propionate-induced recruitment to cat FFAR2 or FFAR3 in CHO-K1 cells.

The growth patterns of limb bones and their relationship with the ontogeny of locomotion are critical to our understanding of variation in morphological, physiological and life-history traits within and among species. Unfortunately, the ontogenetic development of limb bones has not been well explored, especially in altricial birds. In this study, we sampled the entire measurements of the pigeon (Columba livia) of individual skeletons, to investigate the ontogenetic allometry of limb bones by reduced major axis regression. The ulna and humerus were found to be positively allometric in relation to body mass, with the ulna growing more rapidly than the humerus. Together with previous data, this suggests that strong positive allometric growth in forelimb bones could be a common trend among diverse Carinatae groups. Hindlimb was dominated by positive allometry, but was variable in the growth of the tarsometatarsus which included three allometric patterns. A greater dorsoventral diameter in the midsection of the humerus and ulna confers superior bending resistance and is ideal for flapping/gliding flight. Shape variation in the midsection of different hindlimb components reflects different mechanical loading, and the markedly inverse trend between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus before 28 days of age also suggests loading change before fledging. Before fledging, the growth of the leg bones was prior to that of the wing bones. This kind of asynchronous development of the fore- and hindlimbs was associated with the establishment and improvement of different functions, and with shifts in the importance of different functions over time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Columbidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wings, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We herein report of such a case in a 13-year-old Arabian broodmare that had spontaneously died on a paddock. An autopsy revealed multifocal myocardial atrophy with concomitant fibrosis and fatty infiltration in both the ventricles and interventricular septum. The Purkinje fibres in the ventricles and interventricular septum were surrounded by thick fibrous or adipose tissues adjacent to atrophic myocardial cells. Myocardial fibrosis and fatty infiltration were likely secondary to myocardial atrophy, occurring as a pathological response triggered by the repair of muscular wall injury. However, there were no major vascular pathologies (e.g. atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis); hence, the pathogenesis of myocardial atrophy was unclear. There was no evidence of myocardial atrophy &#821; induced pathologies such as infarct, ischaemic lesions, myocardial degeneration, myocarditis and endocarditis. However, such an unusual histopathological pattern may be associated with rapid clinical deterioration and death.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atrophy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiomyopathies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fibrosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Purkinje Fibers</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence of and risk factors for brucellosis in dairy cattle in the Chittagong metropolitan area (CMA) of Chittagong, Bangladesh. We collected serum samples (n = 158) from six randomly selected dairy farms in the CMA between February and November, 2015. The Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and a competitive ELISA (cELISA) were used as the screening and confirmatory tests respectively. Farm level and animal level demographic and risk factor data were collected using a questionnaire. The risk factors were analysed using a multivariable logistic regression with random effects. The overall seroprevalences of antibodies against brucellosis in cattle were 21.5% (34/158) and 7.6% (12/158) based on parallel and serial interpretation of the two tests respectively. Our results revealed that 20.3% (32/158) samples were positive using the RBPT and 8.9% (14/158) were positive using the cELISA. The within-herd seroprevalence ranged from 10% to 26.3% and 5 to 20.7% using the RBPT and cELISA tests respectively. The odds of seropositivity were significantly higher in lactating cows (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.02-6.55), cows producing less than 2 litres of milk (OR: 29.6; 95% CI: 4.3-353.8), cow producing 2-12 litres of milk (OR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.1-33.4) and cows with reproductive disorders (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.2-10.1). About 7.6% (12/158) and 1.3% (2/158) of cattle were found to be infected with acute and chronic brucellosis respectively. Based on these results, we suggest that cows that have reproductive disorders and are producing little milk should be prioritized for brucellosis screening in CMA. The screening tests should be used to control brucellosis in cattle in order to protect animal welfare, human health and to minimize the economic losses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dairying</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ewes (n = 93) received a male effect and were divided into two treatment groups including GnRH - hCG (hCG, n = 32), GnRH - GnRH (GnRH, n = 30) and a control (n = 31) group. This study was carried out from April (hormonal injection) to October (lambing). The first doses of GnRH (4.2 &#956;g, Buserelin) were injected at the beginning of the study in treatment groups. These ewes were treated with hCG (250 IU) or the second GnRH dose five days later. All animals received two injections (ten days apart) of 150 &#956;g PGF2&#945; five days after the hCG or the second GnRH injection. Mating was initiated two days after the second prostaglandin injection and lasted for 34 days. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture on days -10, -5, 0 (first PGF2&#945; injection), 17 and 30 during the study. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed through transabdominal ultrasonography on day 40 after the removing of ram. Conception rate was 93.8, 90 and 87.1% in the hCG, GnRH and control groups, respectively. Lambing rate tended to increase in the hCG group compared with the control group (87.1 versus 58.1%; p &lt; .1). There was no significant difference in P4 concentrations among studied groups in identical sampling times (p &gt; .05). In conclusion, the administration of prostaglandin and hCG in combination with the ram effect tended to decrease lambing period. In other words this protocol tended to increase lambing rate at the first cycle. Treatment with hCG or GnRH did not increase serum P4 concentrations of treated Karakul ewes during the non-breeding season.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chorionic Gonadotropin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproductive Control Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, sperm was recovered from the epididymis of 4&#176;C overnight stored slaughtered bulls' testes and the effects of cryopreservation on the bovine epididymal sperm motility (with CASA) and gene expression patterns (with quantitative Real time-PCR) were evaluated. Moreover the fertilizing potential of cryopreserved epididymal sperm was used in in vitro fertilization (IVF). After freezing and thawing of epididymal sperm, total and slow progressive sperm motility, VCL, VAP, MAD, ALH and BCF were significantly decreased (p &lt; .05), while in the parameters of fast progressive motility, VSL, LIN, WOB and STR there were not any significant variations in the frozen sperm compared to fresh (non-frozen) counterpart. The assessment of abundance of transcripts encoding motility (TSSK6) and fertility (PRM1 and PRM2)-related genes in epididymal sperm, showed that these transcripts were affected by freezing especially in slow progressive motility status (p &lt; .01). Furthermore, cleavage and blastocyst rate did not present any significant differences between bovine embryos produced in vitro by fresh or frozen-thawed epididymal sperm. It can be concluded that epididymal sperm has enough freezability after overnight testes storage, and cryopreservation could not affect the percentage of in vitro produced embryos in spite of the changes of relative abundance of some transcripts and direction progressive motility pattern of sperm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical, ECG and biochemical effects of two-dose IV administration of furosemide in dromedary calves. A total of 21 clinically healthy male dromedary calves with the age of 5 (&#177; 1) months and weight of 95 (&#177; 5) kg were studied. The animals were randomly divided into three groups of control (normal saline), low-dose furosemide (2.5 mg/kg) and high-dose furosemide (5 mg/kg). Two IV injections with 12-hr intervals were administered in all animals. The clinical and ECG parameters were measured at 0 (baseline), 2 (T2), 24 (T24) and 48 (T48) hours after drug administration. Serum concentrations of electrolytes were measured at T0, T24 and T48 hr. The results of this study showed no changes in clinical parameters (heart rate, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and Unruminal motility), ECG indices and also no significant changes in serum electrolytes levels. Under conditions with free access to fresh water, two-dose IV injection of furosemide (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) could be administered in healthy dromedary calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diuretics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrolytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Furosemide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It needs to be supplemented consistently through an exogenous source to prevent deficiency; however, it is easily affected by a variety of mitigating factors. Additionally, thiamine requirements can be influenced by an individual's dietary composition. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency due to its high metabolic demand. Thiamine deficiency is typically diagnosed based on clinical signs, dietary history and response to thiamine administration. A 5-year-old neutered male Maltese Terrier dog presented with an acute onset of seizures and generalized ataxia. The dog was exclusively fed boiled sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) as a primary diet source for 4 weeks. MR findings and hyperlactatemic conditions were consistent with thiamine deficiency, and the diagnosis was confirmed by measuring thiamine concentrations in blood using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Appropriate thiamine supplementation and diet changes resulted in a rapid improvement in neurological signs. Repeated MR imaging 2 weeks after starting the treatment completely resolved the previously identified abnormalities, and repeated measurements of blood lactate and thiamine levels revealed complete recovery of the thiamine-deficient status.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ipomoea batatas</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thiamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thiamine Deficiency</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Wild birds' high biodiversity, perching and migratory activity, ability to travel long distances and possession of a special adaptive immune system may make them alarming sources of zoonotic CoV-spreading vectors. This review gathers the available evidence on the global spread of CoVs in wild birds to date. The major wild birds associated with different types of CoVs are Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Pelecaniformes, Galliformes, Passeriformes, Psittaciformes, Accipitriformes, Ciconiiformes, Gruiformes and so on. However, the main type of CoVs found in wild birds is gammacoronavirus, followed by deltacoronavirus. Consequently, it is imperative to enable thorough research and continuous monitoring to fill the study gap in terms of understanding their role as zoonotic vectors and the frequent appearance of novel CoVs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The geographic distribution of animal CoVs is worldwide and prevalences were reported in several countries across the five continents. The viruses are known to cause mainly gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with different severity levels. In certain cases, CoV infections are responsible of huge economic losses associated or not to highly public health impact. Despite being enveloped, CoVs are relatively resistant pathogens in the environment. Coronaviruses are characterized by a high mutation and recombination rate, which makes host jumping and cross-species transmission easy. In fact, increasing contact between different animal species fosters cross-species transmission, while agriculture intensification, animal trade and herd management are key drivers at the human-animal interface. If contacts with wild animals are still limited, humans have much more contact with farm animals, during breeding, transport, slaughter and food process, making CoVs a persistent threat to both humans and animals. A global network should be established for the surveillance and monitoring of animal CoVs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coronavirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Public Health</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The emergency and spread of polymyxin-associated resistance gene mcr-1 evoked great panic of no medicine to cure the bacterial infection in society. mcr-1 is widespread in domestic and wild animals. Therefore, continuous monitoring of its prevalence and characteristics is required. In this study, we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to detect the mcr-1 of Escherichia coli isolated from rabbits of Tai'an, China, and determined the characteristics of mcr-1-bearing plasmids. A total of 55 non-duplicated E. coli was recovered from the swabs of rabbit faeces. Plasmid profiling, plasmid and chromosome PCR, complete genome sequencing, a conjugation experiment, lactose fermentation experiment, multilocus sequence typing and polymyxin resistance tests were performed to determine the characteristics of mcr-1-bearing plasmids. 14.6% (8/55) of the specimens were mcr-1 positive. The mcr-1-positive E. coli harboured more drug-resistant genes compared with the mcr-1-negative specimens, and results showed four sequence types. Overall, these findings suggested the possible threat of the transmission of mcr-1 from rabbits to humans, especially since the gene is located on transferable plasmids making horizontal transfer relatively easy. Since food-producing animals are necessary for our daily diet, worldwide cooperation is needed in fighting the spread of this drug resistance gene to avoid human infections with MDR pathogenic bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plasmids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The six detected strains were hard to genotype with reference viruses due to their diverse phylogenetic relationship. PCV3 capsid, ORF3 and replicase protein coding genes were reassembled at the nucleotide sequence level, then 16 new reassembled PCV3 sequences were generated. Based on the maximum likelihood mapping analysis of 303 PCV3 sequences a model with a combination of replicase, ORF3 and capsid protein coding genes was selected as the most appropriate target for genotyping, which provided the best support for the clade classification into three genotypes and several subtypes (genotype 1, genotype 2; subtype: a and b, genotype 3; subtype a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h). This study, the IH_Korea_2017 and N62_Korea_2018 strains belong to genogroup 3 (subtype a) the SJ_Korea_2017 strain genogroup 3 (subtype g) and the N5, N10, N13 Korea_ 2018 strains genogroup 3 (subtype f), respectively.

Such technologies could also be used in the reproductive management of this pet species. The present work reports an improved freezing protocol for ferret sperm. Semen was collected by electroejaculation plus rectal massage (in an attempt to reduce the electrical stimulation necessary) from five adult male ferrets, and then subjected to one of two freezing protocols: (a) from 5 to -35&#176;C at 40&#176;C/min, then from -35 to -65&#176;C at 17&#176;C/min, and finally from -65 to -85&#176;C at 3&#176;C/min-a decelerating freezing rate; and (b) from 5 to - 10&#176;C at 5&#176;C/min, and then from -10 to -130&#176;C at 60&#176;C/min-an accelerating freezing rate.

For clinical evaluation of Zactran&#174; against swine respiratory disease, 305 pigs from six commercial farms in three countries in Europe with signs associated with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and/or Haemophilus parasuis and/or Pasteurella multocida and/or Bordetella bronchiseptica were used. At each site, animals were treated once in a 1:1 ratio with a single intramuscular dose of Zactran&#174; (6 mg gamithromycin/kg bodyweight) or Zuprevo&#174; (4% w/v tildipirosin at 4 mg/kg bodyweight; MSD Animal Health) at the recommended dose respectively. Animals were observed and scored daily for 10 consecutive days for signs of swine respiratory disease (depression, respiration and rectal temperature), and animals presenting signs of clinical swine respiratory disease (Depression Score 3 and/or Respiratory Score 3 associated with Rectal Temperature &gt; 40.0&#176;C) were removed from the study and considered as treatment failure. Animals which remained in the study were individually assessed for 'treatment success' or 'treatment failure' (Depression Score &#8805; 1 and Rectal Temperature &gt; 40.0&#176;C or Respiratory Score &#8805; 1 and Rectal Temperature &gt; 40.0&#176;C). Using a non-inferiority hypothesis test (non-inferiority margin = 0.10), the proportion of treatment successes in the Zactran&#174; group (97%) was equivalent to or better than that in the Zuprevo&#174; group (93%).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Actinobacillus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bordetella Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bordetella bronchiseptica</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Haemophilus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Haemophilus parasuis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Macrolides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pasteurella Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pasteurella multocida</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Tract Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, elucidating pangolins' susceptibility to disease is the key to conservation progress. At the Pangolin Research Base for Artificial Rescue and Conservation Breeding of South China Normal University (PRB-SCNU), vitamin A deficiency was diagnosed in 14 captive Sunda pangolins. Typical eye signs included lacrimal eyes, keratopathy and a blank, milky orb. The afflicted pangolins were treated with vitamins A and D for 15-30 days; all individuals recovered. We report the detection and treatment of vitamin A deficiency in captive Sunda pangolins at the PRB-SCNU. Our results could provide guidance for the future prevention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency and associated diseases in pangolin species, both to reduce the incidence of these diseases in captive pangolins and to aid conservation efforts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Zoo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Conservation of Natural Resources</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pangolins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin A</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin A Deficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study evaluated the seropositivity for brucellosis using Rose Bengal test and complement fixation test in suspect cattle, sheep, goats and pigs sera submitted to Bacterial Serology Laboratory, Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary Research (ARC-OVR) from nine provinces in the country during the period 2007-2015. This retrospective data analysis was conducted to estimate the occurrence of brucellosis in the country from the submitted samples, identify variables that affected seropositivity for brucellosis, investigate existing gaps in data recording and make recommendations on important variables to facilitate better data capture and inferences on brucellosis. Nine years of data were collated and analysed to detect association (seropositivity over time regarding animal species and location). Of the 764,276 animals tested, the distribution of samples was 90.50% (691,539/764,276), 5.19% (39,672/764,276), 3.92% (29,967/764,276) and 0.41% (3,098/764,276) for cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, respectively. The seropositivity for brucellosis by animal species was 6.31% (43,666/691,539, 95% CI: 6.26-6.37), 2.09% (828/39,672, 95% CI: 1.95-2.23), 0.63% (189/29,967, 95% CI: 0.55-0.73) and 0.13% (4/3,098, 95% CI: 0.05-0.33) in cattle, sheep, goats and pigs respectively. The data available did not capture information on the age, sex, breed and other host risk factors that would have been related to seropositivity for brucellosis. The data provide an understanding of the disease occurrence and confirm that brucellosis is enzootic in South Africa. Improved and standardized data collection can be used to pro-actively drive, monitor, change or formulate policies to mitigate the challenges brought about by brucellosis in the livestock sector in South Africa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Complement Fixation Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rose Bengal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>South Africa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Based on a 2 &#215; 3 factorial arrangement of treatments including two dietary levels (10% and 20%) of raw, soaked or boiled oak fruit as well as a corn-soybean meal-based diet, 7 experimental diets with 4 replicates and 6 chickens per replicate cages were evaluated during an 8-week period. The data were analysed using GLM procedure of SAS. Significantly higher feed consumption was observed in 10% boiled oak compared with soaked oak (p &lt; .05). Significantly improved feed conversion ratio was observed in 10% boiled oak compared with soaked oak (p &lt; .05). Diet inclusion of 10% oak fruit caused significant increased shell weight. Significant interaction between oak level and processing method on the egg-specific gravity was observed (p &lt; .05), and higher egg-specific gravity was detected in hens fed the diets included 20% boiled or 20% raw oak compared to 20% soaked oak. Significantly increased blood LDL level was observed in hens fed the diets that included boiled and soaked oak (p &lt; .05). In conclusion, based on the results of the present study, 10% boiled oak can be substituted corn in diet of laying hens with no unfavourable effect on performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nuts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quercus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This questionnaire-based study aimed to document the use of aminoglycosides with a particular focus on gentamicin. An online questionnaire was delivered to generalist equine veterinary surgeons and specialists in internal medicine to determine the perceived importance, frequency of use and routes of administration of the aminoglycoside antibiotics. A series of hypothetical scenarios were also evaluated regarding gentamicin. Data were compared to evaluate the impact of the level of specialisation on prescribing practices for different antibiotics using Chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests. Data were analysed from 111 responses. Gentamicin was commonly used empirically without culture and susceptibility testing. Generalists were more likely to use gentamicin only after susceptibility testing than specialists in a variety of clinical presentations including respiratory diseases, septic peritonitis, acute febrile diarrhoea, cellulitis and contaminated limb wounds (p &lt; 0.01). Intravenous administration of gentamicin was most common, although inhaled and regional administration of gentamicin and amikacin were also described. Amikacin was most commonly used by intra-articular administration. Gentamicin was more likely to be used in high-risk procedures or contaminated surgeries (86% and 74%, respectively) compared with clean surgery (32%; p &lt; 0.0001). Gentamicin was often used perioperatively in horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy and more commonly used in horses undergoing an enterotomy (90%) than without and enterotomy (79%; p = 0.04). Most respondents (86%) used gentamicin at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg in adults, with few changing their dosing strategies based on the presence of sepsis, although higher doses were more reported in foals (7-15 mg/kg) irrespective of the presence of sepsis. Aminoglycosides are widely used in equine practice and use outside current EU marketing authorisations is common. Stewardship of the aminoglycoside antibiotics could be enhanced in both generalists and specialists through the more frequent use of susceptibility testing, regional administration and dose adjustment, especially in foals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aminoglycosides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, the therapeutic effect of flaxseed oil on the ovariectomized adult rats was investigated. Our results showed that biochemical parameters including calcium, oestrogen and progesterone levels increase 8 weeks after ovariectomy in rats. Also, the amount of alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly after 8 weeks compared with the OVX rat. The healing potential of flaxseed oil was proven by successfully recovering the affected tissue and preventing the unpleasant symptoms of ovariectomized rats. The biological effects of flaxseed oil may be due to high amounts of fatty acids, phytoestrogens and an array of antioxidants. The results suggest that flaxseed oil can mimic the action of oestrogen and can be a potential treatment for hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hormones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Linseed Oil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipid Metabolism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Biocidal products for veterinary use, which contain pesticides approved in Korea, comprise 49 active ingredients within 234 products. Within 17 of these products there are 3 ingredients which are highly hazardous pesticides: coumaphos, dichlorvos and methomyl. In this study, the content of the active ingredients of 160 products sold domestically was investigated. Samples were collected for 119 biocidal products for veterinary use. These were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). Seventeen products were noncompliant (insufficient or excess quantity of active ingredients). The ingredients that were below the stated concentrations were amitraz, chlorpyrifos-methyl, cypermethrin, cyromazine, dichlorvos, fipronil, muscamone and trichlorfon. The ingredients that exceeded the stated concentrations were abamectin, fluvalinate and pyriproxyfen. The noncompliance rate in biocidal products for veterinary use was 9.19%. The results of this study show that three highly hazardous pesticides (coumaphos, dichlorvos and methomyl) and 10 active ingredients (abamectin, amitraz, chlorpyrifos-methyl, cypermethrin, cyromazine, fipronil, fluvalinate, muscamone, pyriproxyfen and trichlorfon) deviated from the stated concentrations. Thus, management plans should be established to ensure compliant veterinary drugs by post-distribution quality control, such as planning for regular inspection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pesticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Republic of Korea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ten Dorper sheep, without any sedation, were evaluated starting from the second month of pregnancy through transabdominal ultrasound with an ultrasound device equipped with a convex transducer. Images of the fetal heart were obtained through maternal abdominal ultrasound by identifying the position of the fetus and conducting the following measurements: length and diameter of the heart, dimensions of the right and left ventricles and dimensions of the right and left atria. The measurements could only be conducted with acceptable precision starting from the third month of pregnancy. There was a significant difference only for left ventricle diameter, which was larger in the fifth month of pregnancy. The echocardiographic evaluation of the fetus enables monitoring the heart development identifying early fetal viability, assessing inadequate events that could put the pregnancy at risk, especially for production animals. For the experimental design of research employing production animals, it is important to consider, among other factors, the limitations of the evaluation on the field, such as restraining the animals, the stress caused by handling and environmental conditions, temperature, luminosity, facilities available and the qualifications of the team.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fetal Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The normal-temperature group (NTG) was maintained at 21&#176;C and fed the basic diet. The treatment groups were fed the basic diet supplemented with 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% chitosan, respectively, in normal-temperature environment for 30 days and then exposed to heat (35&#176;C and 40% relative humidity) for 3 hr. The results showed that the immune function and anti-oxidative enzyme activities in L. lutea in heat-stressed environment were enhanced by chitosan supplementation, whereas oxidative damage of tissues and cells were alleviated. The results revealed that addition of 0.5% chitosan to the diet may be optimal, playing a key role in meeting the demands of captive-bred L. lutea in high-temperature environments. This may constitute a useful feeding strategy in accordance with the behavioural selection of wild L. lutea, and could effectively promote ex situ conservation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chitosan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Response</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Songbirds</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Treatments consisted of different levels of SAM (7%, 14%, 21% and 28% of diet) and control diet that was performed in a completely randomized design in 42 days. Body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) were recorded weekly. Carcass characteristics and blood variables were measured on the 42 day of age. Immune response to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was assessed at d 35 and d 42 (7 days after each injection). White blood cell count was done at d 28. The results showed that chickens fed 28% of SAM had lowest FI during the experiment. During grower period and also whole period of experiment, BWG was highest in chickens that consumed 7% SAM. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly increased in chickens fed 28% SAM compared to the other treatments during grower period and also whole period of the experiment. The relative weight of thigh and breast significantly decreased and the relative weight of GIT increased by increasing levels of SAM in the diet. The concentration of cholesterol and LDL significantly decreased in chickens that consumed SAM in the diet. However, the highest glucose and HDL concentration were observed in chickens fed 28% SAM in the diet. Treatments did not have a significant effect on the immune response of broilers (primary and secondary SRBC antibody titres, relative weights of spleen and bursa of fabricius and white blood cell count) (p &gt; 0.05). The results of this study show that a diet supplemented with SAM at the level of 14%, due to the improved FCR and decreased blood cholesterol and LDL concentration, can be a good replacement for soybean meal in broiler chicken's nutrition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Proteins, Dietary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prunus dulcis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weight Gain</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In Study 1, Felix O1 was administered orally for 12 consecutive days. Over 60 days, swabs were taken from the oral cavity and cloaca and qualitative Salmonella detection as well as salmonella quantification from faecal samples were performed. In Study 2, a phage cocktail (Felix O1 and S16) was administered to half of the tested animals. Salmonella (S.) Eastbourne was also given orally to all animals. Oral and cloacal swabs were tested as in Study 1, and faecal samples were collected for phage quantification. Various Salmonella serovars were detectable at the beginning of the study. The numbers of serovars detected declined over the course of the study. S. Kisarawe was most commonly detected. Salmonella titres ranged from 10[2] to 10[7] cfu/g faeces. The phages (Felix O1 and S16) were detectable for up to 20 days after the last administration. The initial phage titres ranged from 10[3] to 10[7] pfu/ml. The study shows that the phages were able to replicate in the intestine, and were shed for a prolonged period and therefore could contribute to a reduction of Salmonella shedding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Shedding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lizards</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Infections, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Phages</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The horse was presented with complaints of lethargy and inappetence and it collapsed on the day of visit. Normal saline and dextrose solution were administered intravenously, while multivitamins and nerve supplements were given intramuscularly to stabilise the horse before further treatment. Haematological findings showed normocytic hypochromic anaemia and are suggestive of regenerative anaemia. Thin blood smear and examination revealed the presence of Trypanosoma sp., and it was confirmed as T. evansi through molecular identification. The horse was found dead 2 days after and post-mortem was conducted. Histopathology revealed that the horse had developed a neurological form of the disease, besides the detection of the protozoa in heart, spleen and kidney tissue. This first positive Surra case in Kelantan, Malaysia, that is bordering Thailand confirms the increasing concern of transboundary infections. In conclusion, Surra is a potential emerging disease and should be considered as differential diagnosis in horses with pale mucous membrane.

Major improvements have been made in pig farming in China in the last four decades with the growing application of new livestock farming technologies. Among the new improvements, the use of antibiotics in pig farming is a common but not well-documented practise. In order to understand the behaviour of the farmers regarding antibiotic use in pig farming, we conducted a household survey in four townships of L County in Yunnan Province, China, during August 2014 and April 2015. In this survey, 404 farmer households were interviewed using a questionnaire. Among the farmers interviewed, 89% reported easy access to antibiotics, 83.7% reported experience of self-purchasing antibiotics, and 40.3% reported that they often used antibiotics in pig farming mainly for the prevention and treatment of pig diseases. These farmers identified 20 antibiotics that they had used in pig farming 6 months before the survey. Of these, 11 and 8 antibiotics have been categorised under 'critically important' and 'highly important' antimicrobial groups, respectively, by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 12 and 8 have been categorised under the 'Watch' and 'Access' groups, respectively, as per the 2019 WHO AWaRe classification of antibiotics. Factors associated with the behaviour of self-purchasing antibiotics included types of farms, sources of antibiotics, and previous experiences of pig diseases: those who were smallholders, buying antibiotics from veterinary drugstores and village vets, and whose pigs had suffered diseases previously were more likely to self-purchase antibiotics for their pigs. Farmers who cleaned their pigsties less frequently and those whose pigs had suffered from diseases used antibiotics more frequently as compared to their peer farmers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adult</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Middle Aged</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Young Adult</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-four healthy male mixed breed dogs, aged 1-2 years, weighing 20.4 &#177; 2.6 kg was studied. Each dog was anaesthetized twice, with at least one week for washout. Animals were sedated with acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Forty minutes later, anaesthesia was induced using intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg/kg) titration and maintained for 30 min by propofol (0.2 mg kg[-1] min[-1]). After propofol was discontinued, doxapram (2 mg/kg) hydrochloride was administrated IV in PD treatment while an equal volume of saline was administrated in PS treatment. Blood parameters were analysed in four times: immediately before sedation (T1), after treatment (T2), after complete recovery (T3) and 24 hr later (T4). Haematological assessments revealed no significant difference between treatments except in haematocrit which was significantly reduced at T4 (24 hr later) in PD. A decreasing trend of all haematological variables was observed after doxapram administration until recovery, except monocyte, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width and platelet count. Serum urea, creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, direct bilirubin concentration and alanine aminotransferase activity were not changed following doxapram administration compared to the PS treatment. After doxapram administration, Creatinine (T3), Albumin (T2) and Protein (T2 &amp; T3) decreased while Glucose (T2 &amp; T3) and BT (T3) increased. Antioxidant parameters measured showed no difference between treatments or time. Doxapram (2 mg/kg) IV did not induce any major negative effects on haematological, serum biochemical variables and oxidant/antioxidant status in dogs after propofol anaesthesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthetics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System Stimulants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxapram</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Erythrocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematologic Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Propofol</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, it was reported that the CD44v8-10 isoform interacts with the system Xc(-) transporter-related protein (xCT), and inhibits the accumulation of reactive oxygen species by promoting the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione in human tumour cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of CD44 variants and xCT in canine tumours. From semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of the CD44v8-10 isoform was observed in canine tumour tissues as well as human cases. The overexpression of CD44v8-10 may promote the synthesis of glutathione and enhance the resistance to radiation of canine breast tumour cells. Furthermore, canine xCT mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in the canine breast tumour tissues as compared to the normal tissues surrounding the tumours. To investigate the function of canine xCT, we treated canine tumour cells with the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine. Consequently, the sulfasalazine-treated cells were more sensitive to oxidative stress than the non-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggested that CD44v8-10 and xCT play important roles in the therapy resistance of canine tumours as well as human tumours.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amino Acid Transport Systems, Acidic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers, Tumor</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breast Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glutathione</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyaluronan Receptors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protein Isoforms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reactive Oxygen Species</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sulfasalazine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Up-Regulation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Measurement of cytokeratin 18 (CK18), an intracellular structural protein released during epithelial apoptosis, and Alpha1-Antitrypsin (A1AT) in faeces provides a mechanism for evaluating damage to the intestinal mucosa secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our goal was to evaluate the clinical utility of plasma CK18 and faecal A1-AT levels as non-invasive biomarkers of cytotoxic chemotherapy induced GI toxicity. We conducted a prospective cohort study in dogs (N = 10) with osteosarcoma undergoing amputation followed by carboplatin chemotherapy. We hypothesized that plasma CK18 and faecal A1-AT levels would increase following carboplatin administration due to drug-induced GI epithelial damage/apoptosis, and that plasma CK18 and faecal A1-AT levels would correlate with severity of GI toxicity. Mean baseline plasma CK18 concentration was variable amongst patients; however, CK18 concentration prior to carboplatin chemotherapy treatment was not significantly different from CK18 levels after treatment. There was significant intra and inter-patient variability in mean faecal A1-AT levels at baseline. Mean A1-AT concentration did not change significantly from day 0 to day 21. Gastrointestinal toxicity was minimal; therefore, we were unable to determine the association of plasma CK18 and faecal A1-AT concentrations with development of GI toxicosis. In this study population, plasma CK18 and faecal A1-AT concentration were not clinically useful biomarkers for the detection of GI toxicosis secondary to carboplatin administration. Further prospective evaluation of CK18 and A1-AT as biomarkers of drug-induced GI toxicity is warranted in a larger cohort of dogs receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Initial diagnostic workup, including serum biochemistry panel, complete blood count and coagulation profile, was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound showed gastric mural thickening and non-obstructive gastric foreign material. Endoscopy was performed to remove the foreign matter and obtain biopsies. Significant abnormalities of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract were not noted endoscopically. Overnight, the patient required a packed red blood cell transfusion following two episodes of severe hematemesis, hypotension and collapse. Serial radiographs and ultrasound revealed hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG). Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed massive gas accumulation within the liver and emphysematous gastritis. The patient became increasingly unstable and, given her rapid decline, humane euthanasia was elected. Gastric and duodenal histopathology showed inflammatory changes, spirochetosis and mucosal epithelial degeneration. HPVG is a rarely described finding and prognosis varies drastically depending on aetiology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of portal vein gas documented on multiple imaging modalities, including CT, in a cat. The patient in this report had several potential risk factors including prior endoscopy, compromise of the intestinal barrier and evidence of gastric mural bacterial invasion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Gas Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portal Vein</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Currently, SFTS is endemic to some areas in western Japan, and wild animals are considered to play important roles in the circulation of SFTSV in the environment. Previous retrospective surveys using samples mainly obtained between 2006 and 2015 revealed serological evidence of SFTSV infection in wild animals; however, seroprevalence before 2006 remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of anti-SFTSV antibodies in a total of 521 serum samples from nine wild animal species collected from 11 prefectures in central and eastern Japan between 1980 and 2000. All samples yielded negative results for antibodies to SFTSV, suggesting that there had been few or no SFTSV infections before 2000 in the sampled areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phlebovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In northern Tanzania, Q fever is a known cause of human febrile illness, but little is known about its distribution in animal hosts. We used a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the insertion element IS1111 to determine the presence and prevalence of C. burnetii infections in small mammals trapped in 12 villages around Moshi Rural and Moshi Urban Districts, northern Tanzania. A total of 382 trapped small mammals of seven species were included in the study; Rattus rattus (n = 317), Mus musculus (n = 44), Mastomys natalensis (n = 8), Acomys wilson (n = 6), Mus minutoides (n = 3), Paraxerus flavovottis (n = 3) and Atelerix albiventris (n = 1). Overall, 12 (3.1%) of 382 (95% CI: 1.6-5.4) small mammal spleens were positive for C. burnetii DNA. Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in five of seven of the small mammal species trapped; R. rattus (n = 7), M. musculus (n = 1), A. wilson (n = 2), P. flavovottis (n = 1) and A. albiventris (n = 1). Eleven (91.7%) of twelve (95% CI: 61.5-99.8) C. burnetii DNA positive small mammals were trapped within Moshi Urban District. These findings demonstrate that small mammals in Moshi, northern Tanzania are hosts of C. burnetii and may act as a source of C. burnetii infection to humans and other animals. This detection of C. burnetii infections in small mammals should motivate further studies into the contribution of small mammals to the transmission of C. burnetii to humans and animals in this region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hedgehogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodent Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodentia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tanzania</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this case report, a large nephroblastoma with peritoneal seeding was found during necropsy in an 11-month-old, female, Sprague Dawley rat. The rat had a history of indirect exposure to nano-TiO2 (titanium dioxide nanoparticles) during maternal gestation. A firm mass in the upper right abdominal quadrant was palpated. Four weeks later, the animal quickly declined. Nephroblastoma was confirmed by histopathology. Only one rat developed nephroblastoma among the ten littermates. Nephroblastomas in Sprague Dawley rats are typically spontaneous tumours with non-malignant mesenchymal elements. The capability to induce a nephroblastoma with nano-TiO2 is less likely in this case.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Laboratory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wilms Tumor</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, we successfully isolated a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from lung tissue and peripheral blood of piglets at a farm from Dujiangyan in Sichuan, China, and named it the DJY-19 strain. The full-length genome sequence of DJY-19 shared 86.8%-94.1% nucleotide similarity with NADC30-like and NADC30 PRRSV strains. We compared the open reading frame (ORF) 5 gene of DJY-19 with 34 PRRSV strains from Genbank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DJY-19 clustered with NADC30 strains, characterized by a predicted 131-amino-acid deletion in the nonstructural protein (NSP) 2. The results of homology analysis showed that the homology between DJY-19 and NADC30 (JN654459.1) strains was the highest (95.9%), whereas homology with other domestic strains was lower (80.9%-92.6%). Furthermore, we identified four recombination breakpoints in the DJY-19 genome; they separated the DJY-19 genome into four regions. The 8106-9128 nucleotide (nt) region of DIY-19 was highly similar to the TJ strain, and the 12106-12580 nt region of DIY-19 was highly similar to the JXA1-R strain. Our findings demonstrate that DJY-19 arose from the recombination of North America NADC30 strain and TJ strain and JXA1-R in China. The application of multiple attenuated vaccine strains has led to complex recombination of PRRSV strains in China. This study provides a theoretical basis for making a more reasonable PRRS virus control and prevention strategy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amino Acid Sequence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Alignment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viral Nonstructural Proteins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Experimental diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg body weight), 15 min after intraperitoneal injection of NA (120 mg/kg body weight). NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats were orally supplemented with M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel hydroethanolic extracts in a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. The treatment of NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats with M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel extracts significantly decreased the elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and vLDL-cholesterol levels and significantly increased the lowered serum insulin level, liver glycogen content, serum HDL-cholesterol level, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IS) and HOMA-&#946; cell function. The elevated cardiovascular risk indices in diabetic rats were significantly improved due to treatment with M. paradisiaca extracts. Concomitant with the increase in liver glycogen content, the glucose-6-phosphatase activity significantly decreased reflecting the decrease in hepatic glucose output. The heart function was potentially ameliorated as manifested by decrease in the elevated serum creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase activities after treatments of diabetic rats with M. paradisiaca extracts. The elevated liver lipid peroxidation and the decline in liver glutathione content and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were significantly reversed by treatments. Thus, it can be concluded that M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel hydroethanolic extracts may have antihyperlipidemic and cardioprotective potentials in NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats. These effects may be mediated via improvements in the glycemic state, &#946;-cell function, tissue insulin sensitivity, and antioxidant defense mechanism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fruit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glycemic Index</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoglycemic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipid Metabolism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Musa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Niacinamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Leaves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats, Wistar</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptozocin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Micro-dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). In vitro-induced drug resistance was conducted for S. agalactiae (CVCC1886) and S. dysgalactiae (CVCC3701) by gradually increasing the antimicrobial concentration (strains were from IVDC, China). PCR was used to detect the resistance and virulence genes of the strains before and after resistance induction. Colony morphology was observed to compare the physiological and biochemical properties of the strains. A total of 88 clean-grade Kunming mice (obtained from Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China) were used in half of the lethal dose (LD50) test for detecting the changes in virulence of strains. The results showed that S. agalactiae (CVCC1886) and S. dysgalactiae (CVCC3701) developed resistance against seven kinds of antibiotics, respectively. Resistance and virulence genes of CVCC3701 were changed when treated by the Penicillin-inducing. The growth of the CVCC3701-PEN was decreased compared to the CVCC3701. Virulence test in mice indicated that the LD50 of CVCC3701 before induction and CVCC3701-PEN after induction were 5.45 &#215; 10[6] and 5.82 &#215; 10[8] CFU/ml, respectively. Compared with the untreated bacteria, the bacterial virulence was reduced 1.1 &#215; 10[2] times after resistance induction. In conclusion, S. dysgalactiae (CVCC3701) is a susceptible strain of drug resistance to antibiotics, in vitro-induced drug resistance reduced the virulence of CVCC3701, but the virulence is still existing and also could result in the death of mice. For public health safety, it must be alert to the emergence of drug resistance of Streptococcus in animal production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcus agalactiae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In China, the first APPV identification in swine herds was reported in Guangdong province in 2016. To investigate the genetic characteristics of APPV in Guangxi province, 53 tissue samples from neonatal piglets with CT were collected and detected from October 2017 to May 2019. Five APPV strains which were named as GX04/2017, GX01-2018, GX02-2018, GX01-2019 and GX02-2019 were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that all six APPV strains from Guangxi province, including five strains from this study and one from a previous report, shared 83.3%-97.5% nucleotide identity of complete genome and 91.7%-99.1% amino acid identity of the open reading frame (ORF), and shared 77.7%-97.7% nucleotide identity of complete genome and 90.6%-99.3% amino acid identity of ORF with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all APPV strains could be divided into three clades based on the complete genome, N[pro] , E[rns] and E2 gene sequences, respectively; and the APPV strains from Guangxi province distributed in two clades (clades I and II). No sign of recombination was observed from Guangxi strains. Evolution analysis performed on the complete genome of 58 APPV strains showed that America, Europe and Asia strains during 2006-2019 evolved at a mean rate of 1.37 &#215; 10[-4] substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of them was estimated as 1,700.5 years ago. The findings of this study indicated that there existed a high degree of genetic diversity of APPV from Guangxi province, Southern China, which provided important information on the epidemiological features and evolutionary relationships of APPV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Evolution, Molecular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pestivirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pestivirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tremor</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, few descriptions of the blood parameters of Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) have been reported because these tigers comprise an endangered species; however, it is extremely difficult to obtain blood samples necessary for these analyses. This study presents 14 haematological and 16 biochemical parameters of 133 Siberian tigers, of which 112 and 21 were from Heilongjiang Siberian Tiger Park (HB) and Hailin Siberian Tiger Park (HD), China, respectively. Our study is the first to determine the following parameters in Siberian tigers: red blood cell volume distribution width, platelet count, mean platelet volume, amylase (AMY), sodium/potassium, globulin and albumin/globulin levels. As the data for total bilirubin and AMY were not statistically significant, no statistical analysis was conducted for these parameters. Few parameters were significantly different according to sex and region (p &lt; 0.05). The concentration of alkaline phosphatase decreased with age, whereas the creatinine (CREA) increased with age. The CREA concentration of tigers raised in HB was much lower than that of tigers raised in HD. The data obtained in this study provide a reference for monitoring the health of wild and captive Siberian tigers and will add important information to the standards for haematological and biochemical parameters of wild felines.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Zoo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endangered Species</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematologic Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tigers</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 85 broiler chicks of Ross 308 were purchased and 64 well-conditioned chicks were selected and divided into four experimental groups with four replicates and four chicks per replicate. The diets of groups 2, 3 and 4 were mixed with 1, 2 and 3% of vinegar, respectively, and group 1 as the control group was fed by the standard diet. The results showed that body weight gain was higher in the groups fed vinegar than the control group.

Vinegar intake through the diet did not change significantly the weight of Bursa of Fabricius (p = .369) and spleen (p = .122). Vinegar significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen levels in the treatment groups compared with the control group (p = .0052). There was a significant increase in the level of antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus by haemagglutination inhibition test in the groups receiving vinegar in comparison with control group (p = .0358). Compared with the control group, the villus height (p = .0022) and intestinal crypts depth (p = .0015) significantly increased in the groups receiving apple cider vinegar.

Although mycobacterial infections are generally uncommon in horses, 10 equine abortion cases caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) infections occurred between 2018 and 2019 in Japan. They occurred on seven Thoroughbred horse farms in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but direct contact among the mares on different farms was not recorded. Most cases were characterized by extensive pathological lesions of the placenta, which are not typical in cases of common pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Escherichia coli. All abortions featured white-yellow exudates on the surface of the placenta. Mycobacterial granuloma formations were histologically found in the placenta and fetal organs, and acid-fast bacteria were isolated from the placenta, fetal samples (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and stomach contents) or uterine lavage fluid. The greatest number of bacteria was isolated from necrotic lesions on the placenta, which could be an important site for bacterial isolation in mycobacterial equine abortions. The isolates were identified as MAH based on internal genome sequences. In variable number tandem repeat analysis, all patterns of the strains were identical. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the core genome grouped all strains in the II-a/SC3 subcluster. Both results reveal that these strains share the same genetic background, suggesting that the horses had been infected by the same unknown contagious source.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abortion, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycobacterium Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Biodynamic imaging (BDI) is a functional imaging technology that measures dynamic light scattering from living, three-dimensional tissues to characterize intracellular motion within those tissues. Previous studies have associated BDI biomarkers with tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy agents in dogs with naturally occurring cancer. We hypothesized that BDI, performed ex vivo on bone marrow aspirate samples, would identify dynamic biomarkers associated with the occurrence of specific degrees of neutropenia in tumour-bearing dogs receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy.</Abstract><Abstract>Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 10 dogs with naturally occurring cancers prior to initiation of doxorubicin treatment. BDI was performed on bone marrow samples treated ex vivo with doxorubicin at 0.1, 1, 10 and 100&#160;&#956;M along with 0.1% DMSO as a control. Dogs then were treated with doxorubicin (30&#160;mg/m[2] , intravenously). Peripheral blood neutrophil counts were obtained on the day of treatment and again 7&#160;days later. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified provisional breakpoints for BDI biomarkers that correlated with specific changes in neutrophil counts between the two time points.</Abstract><Abstract>Provisional breakpoints for several BDI biomarkers were identified, specifying dogs with the largest proportionate change in neutrophils and with neutropenia that was grade 2 or higher following doxorubicin treatment.</Abstract><Abstract>Biodynamic imaging of bone marrow aspirates may identify those dogs at greater risk for neutropenia following doxorubicin chemotherapy.

The trial mainly included analysis of FLO in plasma after a single dose dietary administration of 10 mg/kg and in muscle plus skin following a multiple dosing (10 mg kg[-1] day[-1] for 7 days) to estimate pharmacokinetics and residue depletion, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration of FLO was measured to be 1.64 &#956;g/ml, 4 hr post administration. The elimination half-life (t1/2b) and the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-&#8734;) were calculated to be 13.0 hr and 34.7 &#956;g h[-1] ml[-1] , respectively. Withdrawal times of FLO and its amine were calculated to be 46.3 degree-days, indicating a fast removal from the edible tissues of treated European seabass.

This study aims to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MC4R gene with live body weight and hormonal assays in two breeds of sheep that differ in productive performance, Awassi and Arabi. All known coding sequences of the MC4R gene were covered in this study. DNA samples from 150 animals (Awassi and Arabi breed) were genotyped by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) to assess their pattern of genetic variation. Concerning exon 1, clear heterogeneity was detected with three different SSCP-banding patterns. The sequencing reactions confirmed these variations by detecting the presence of the two novel SNPs, 107G/C and 138A/C, and three genotypes, GC, AC and AA. The 107G/C SNP was detected in GC genotype, while the 138A/C was detected on both GC and AC genotypes. The other SSCP-banding pattern (AA genotype) did not show any detectable unique variation. Both SNPs were closely and strongly linked in both breeds (D' and r[2] values were 1.00), which signifies that both loci were co-inherited as one unit. Association analysis indicated that both breeds with GC/AC haplotype showed higher live body weight (37.250 &#177; 0.790) relative to the GG/AA (30.244 &#177; 0.968) and CC/CC (47.231 &#177; 1.230) haplotypes (p &lt; .05). Concerning the genotyping of exon 2, only 362 bp showed heterogeneity with a missense mutation, with no significant association (p &gt; .05) with the measured traits. In conclusion, the two novel SNPs (107G/C and 138 A/C) were highly associated with live body weight in both breeds. Haplotype analysis confirmed that these two novel SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and could be used as genetic markers for sheep phenotypic trait improvement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gonadal Steroid Hormones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Haplotypes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iraq</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purposes of this study are to search for polymorphisms of KLF3 coding region and to provide functional evidence for abdominal fat in chickens. A total of 168 SNPs in KLF3 coding region were detected in a unique chicken population, the Northeast Agricultural University broiler lines divergently selected for abdominal fat content (NEAUHLF). Of which three single nucleotide polymorphisms (g.3452T &gt; C, g.8663A &gt; G and g.10751G &gt; A) were significantly correlated with abdominal fat weight (AFW) and abdominal fat percentage (AFP) of 329 birds from the 19th generation of NEAUHLF (FDR &lt; 0.05). The reporter gene assay was performed to verify functionality of these three SNPs in both ICP-1 and DF1 cells. Results showed that the luciferase activity of G allele was significantly higher than that of A allele in g.10751G &gt; A (p &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between different alleles of others two SNPs in luciferase activity. Overall, KLF3 is an important candidate gene that affects chicken abdominal fat content, and the g.10751G &gt; A is a functional variant that potential would be applied to marker-assisted selection (MAS) for selective breeding programme.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Fat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Open Reading Frames</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To our knowledge, no scientific effort has been made to evaluate the efficacy of lysostaphin in sows with clinical endometritis. Lysostaphin, loaded in effervescent tablets that were completely foamed and dissolved within 30 min in the presence of water or body fluids and released active lysostaphin, were administered vaginally on endometritis sows in this study. The clinical recovery, bacterial clearance and reproductive performance of sows with endometritis were investigated. We found that the 400U dosage (400U lysostaphin/pill/time, repeat once on the third day, a total of two times, with 10% oxytetracycline uterine injection as a control) is the most effective treatment. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent finding (34%, n = 188), followed by Streptococcus (32%, n = 181), Escherichia coli (19%, n = 104) and other bacilli (15%, n = 83) before treatment by drugs. Administration of lysostaphin resulted in an extremely significant (p &lt; .01) reduction in S. aureus (0.18 &#177; 0.25 from 4.57 &#177; 0.33) and Streptococcus (0.11 &#177; 0.14 from 3.88 &#177; 0.29), as well as a significant (p &lt; .05) reduction in E. coli (0.55 &#177; 0.42 from 3.11 &#177; 0.14). Mixed infections (83%) were predominant before treatment, in contrast to single infections (61%) after treatment. Large-scale trials were conducted to verify the clinical efficacy of lysostaphin on sow endometritis. The average cure rate of 400u lysostaphin on sow endometritis(82.5%) was higher than the antibiotic group(72.17%). In addition, our results revealed that intravaginal administration of lysostaphin had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of sows.

Forty-two Shami goat kids (20 &#177; 2.47 kg live weight and 133 &#177; 5.44 days of age) were randomly allotted to three dietary treatment groups, control (75% commercial concentrate and 25% wheat straw), OTU (62.3% commercial concentrate + 37.7% olive twigs and leaves treated with 4% urea for 14 days), OTUM (51.5% concentrate mixture + 48.5% olive twigs and leaves treated with 4% urea for 14 days then sprayed by 10% molasses). Cost (SYP/t) of control, OUT and OTUM was 12,600, 10,066 and 10,106 respectively. The study consisted of a growth trial of 100 days and a digestibility trial of 12 days (7 days of adaptation and 5 days of urine and faeces collection). Serum urea, total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, haemoglobin and packed cell volume were determined. Daily dry matter intake, digestibility of crude protein, ether extract and nutrient detergent fibre did not significantly differ among the dietary treatments (p &gt; .05). Nitrogen intake, nitrogen excretion in urine and faeces and nitrogen balance was not significantly affected (p &gt; .05) by the dietary treatment. The dietary treatment did not have any significant effect on average daily gain, feed conversion ratio or blood variables (p &gt; .05). Olive twigs treated with 4% urea and OTUM replaced 37.7% and 48.5% of conventional diets of growing Shami goat kids without negative effects on growth performance nor health and potentially reduced fattening costs for farmers in olive-livestock mixed systems by 19.8 and 20%, respectively.

The aim of this article is to provide a recent and rapid review on brucellosis prevalence in East African Community (EAC) countries. Literature was obtained using Google Scholar search engine and screened for relevancy and fulfilment of criteria to 1, 17, 4, 4, 30 and 29 articles retained for brucellosis prevalence in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Recent literature (published in the last decade 2010 to 2019) was considered for prevalence results in this review. In EAC, livestock had an animal-level prevalence of 0.2% to 43.8%, 0.0% to 20.0% and 0.0% to 13.8% for cattle, goats and sheep respectively. In humans, the prevalence varied mostly between 0.0% and 35.8%. In conclusion, brucellosis is quite prevalent in the region. The reported prevalence calls for plans or more efforts from individual member countries and from EAC, as a region, to control brucellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Africa, Eastern</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The adult worm lives in the intestine, and horizontal transmission of the infection occurs through eating paratenic host or embryonated eggs. This study aimed to estimate the molecular prevalence of Toxocara species in stray cats using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique. A total of 95 stool samples were randomly collected from stray cats in Khorramabad city in western Iran. Microscopic examination was performed after the separation and extraction of supernatants. The LAMP reaction was performed using the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) gene primers of Toxocara species and the appropriate master mix. The overall prevalence of Toxocara spp. in stray cats was 20% (19/95, CI 95%: 0.2 &#177; 0.08) by parasitological and molecular assessments. The microscopic examination of stool samples revealed that 19 samples were positive for Toxocara. The same 19 positive samples were also positive by the LAMP technique. Interestingly, based on the results of the LAMP assay, out of 95 studied samples, 18 (18.94%; CI 95%: 0.19 &#177; 0.08) specimens were Toxocara canis, while only 1 (1.05%; CI 95%: 0.005 &#177; 0.01) sample was diagnosed as Toxocara cati. The relatively high prevalence of Toxocara species in the studied cats shows the role of this species in spreading the parasite and the role of the cats in transmitting this zoonotic parasite. Preventive measures including the control of stray cat's population by castration and protection of public gardens where children play are recommended. The easy, highly sensitive and specific LAMP method is proposed for the differential detection of Toxocara species in animals and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnostic Tests, Routine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Molecular Diagnostic Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxocara</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxocariasis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In all, 40 newborn calves were randomly divided into four groups of 10 animals. In the control group, animals received no banana meal. In group 1, calves were supplemented with 2 g (dry matter)/kg body weight/day of overripe banana pulp extract. The calves in group 2 were supplemented with 1 g (dry matter) of overripe banana pulp extract/kg body weight/day and 1 g (dry matter) of green banana peel extract/kg body weight/day. The animals in group 3 were supplemented with 2 g/kg body weight/day of green banana peel powder. The feeding period of calves on the tested supplements was 5 days. Blood samples and other evaluations were taken on day 0 (at birth, before supplementation) and on days 7, 15 and 30. Just a trend towards better average daily weight gain was seen in groups 2 and 3 than others (p = 0.073). Significant group and sampling time interactions were seen for the quantities of RBC (group 1 was lower than other groups at day 30), MCV (group 3 was lower than other groups at day 30) and MCH (group 1 was higher than other groups at day 30) (p &lt; 0.05). A trend towards significance in values of IgG (group 1 was lower than other groups at days 15 and 30) and bilirubin (higher values at day 7 in groups 1 and 2 than control, higher amounts at days 15 and 30 in groups 3 and 2 than control, respectively) was also observed. In conclusion, banana supplementation in neonatal calves had beneficial effects on the values of RBC, MCV, MCH, bilirubin, IgG and average daily weight gain in dairy calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fruit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematologic Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Musa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Powders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Herein we report the phenotype and genotype of a normal-appearing 10-month-old colony female that died suddenly. At necropsy examination, there were reduced skeletal and laryngeal muscle volume and mild dilatation of the oesophagus. Microscopic findings consisted of extensive degeneration and regeneration of the axial skeletal, tongue, oesophageal, and laryngeal muscles that were characterized by considerable central nucleation, individual fibre mineralization and interstitial fibrosis. The myocardial findings were limited to infiltration of adipose cells in the interstitium. The female dog was a compound heterozygote with one X chromosome carrying a point mutation in intron 6 of the dystrophin gene and the other X chromosome carrying a repetitive element insertion in intron 13 of the dystrophin gene. Although the direct cause of death was uncertain, it might likely be due to sudden cardiac death as has been seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. This case demonstrated dystrophinopathy in female dogs that have no ameliorating normal X chromosome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dystrophin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heterozygote</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscular Dystrophies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The recent rapid spread of disease in currently disease-free countries indicates the importance of understanding the limitations and routes of distribution. The causative agent, Capripoxvirus, can also induce sheeppox and goatpox. The economic significance of these diseases is of great concern, given that they threaten international trade and could be used as economic bioterrorism agents. The distribution of capripoxviruses seems to be expanding due to limited access to effective vaccines and poverty within farming communities. This is largely due to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the imposition of crippling sanctions in endemic regions, as well as an increase in the legal and illegal trade of live animals and animal products, and also global climate change. The present review is designed to provide existing information on the various aspects of the disease such as its clinicopathology, transmission, epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and control measures, and the potential role of wildlife in the further spread of disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Communicable Diseases, Emerging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumpy Skin Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>SARS-CoV-2</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Six healthy dogs without ocular abnormalities were evaluated in this study. A balloon device was placed in the intra-abdominal cavity. The abdomen was insufflated to IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg using the balloon device. Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline, at IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg, and after decompression. In comparison with the mean baseline IOP (15.1 &#177; 2.0 mmHg), there was a significant increase in IOP at IAP levels of 15 mmHg (20.0 &#177; 2.1 mmHg) and 25 mmHg (19.9 &#177; 2.2 mmHg), corresponding to a 32.4% and 31.7% increase from baseline IOP, respectively. The mean IOP after decompression (14.8 &#177; 1.7 mmHg) was significantly lower compared to those at IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg. The present findings demonstrate that increased IAP has a clinically significant effect on IOP in dogs under conscious conditions. Although more research is needed to determine of increased IAP on IOP, these findings suggest that increased IAP leads to mild and reversible increase in IOP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intra-Abdominal Hypertension</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intraocular Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The increased resistance to antimicrobials against Salmonella has been a major public health concern worldwide. We conducted a study from January to June 2016 in and around the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh on the commercial chicken to isolate, identify and characterize poultry-specific Salmonella, to assess the potential risk factors and to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern of the isolates. The overall prevalence of Salmonella enterica was 41% (49/120) [95% CI: 31.95%-50.17%] with 41.7% in broiler chicken (25/60) [95% CI: 29.06%-55.12%] and 40% in layer chicken (24/60, 40%) [95% CI: 27.56%-53.46%]. Samples collected from Rajshahi city (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.50-3.73) and Puthia Upazila (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.56-4.12) were more likely to be positive for Salmonella than Charghat Upazila. Salmonella detection was 1.3 times higher in chicken, providing loose feed than those provided ready feed. All the isolates fermented dextrose, maltose and mannitol with the production of acid and gas, but did not ferment sucrose and lactose. The isolates showed catalase, MR, citrate utilization test and TSI agar test positive, but indole and V-P tests negative. Salmonella isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (90%), gentamycin (80%), amoxicillin (75%), streptomycin (70%), ampicillin (45%) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (45%), whereas highly resistant to penicillin (100%) and nalidixic acid (100%) followed by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (55%), ampicillin (40%) and amoxicillin (25%). Salmonella enterica is endemic in commercial chicken production in Bangladesh with high prevalence. A considerable proportion of Salmonella isolates was found to be resistant to the majority of the common antimicrobial drugs. A good biosecurity system could be effective for the reduction of Salmonella. It is necessary to obtain universal commitments to establish prudent antibiotic use policies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Infections, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eighteen healthy female mixed-breed dogs, aged 1-2 years, weighed 16.7 &#177; 3.8 kg, were used. Animals were sedated with acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg, intramuscular). Forty minutes later, anaesthesia was induced through intravenous titration with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) and maintained with isoflurane 1.5%. Afterwards, ovariohysterectomy was performed, and prior to the closure of the linea alba, animals received lidocaine containing epinephrine (8.8 mg/kg, ip) in group L, tramadol (4 mg/kg, ip) in group T and lidocaine containing epinephrine (8.8 mg/kg, ip) plus tramadol (4 mg/kg, ip) in the LT group. Cortisol, vital signs and pain scoring systems were evaluated at different time points. Vital signs did not change among the groups. Cortisol level in the LT group significantly decreased compared to the L and T groups one, three and six hours after surgery. Pain scores also did not change among the groups based on Sammarco and Simple descriptive (SDS) scoring method. However, pain scores in the LT group were higher than the two other groups according to the University of Melbourne pain scale (UMPS) and the short form of Glasgow pain scale (CMPS-SF). According to the obtained results, the combination of lidocaine and tramadol seemed to be able to provide better analgesia compared with their separate administration. Therefore, combined intraperitoneal administration of lidocaine (8.8 mg/kg) and tramadol (4 mg/kg) with a final volume of (0.2 ml/kg) following ovariohysterectomy is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Analgesics, Opioid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Combinations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intraperitoneal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lidocaine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tramadol</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The information on these potential hazardous effects to the handlers of the pesticide remains obscure. This study investigated effects of glyphosate-based herbicide on growth performance, seminal parameters and hemato-biochemical profiles in male guinea pig. Forty sexually mature male guinea pigs weighing between 393.3 and 418.4 g were divided into four groups of 10 animals each and orally administered 0, 186, 280 and 560 mg/kg body weight of WILLOSATE daily for 60 days. Daily feed intake and body weight gain were recorded. At the end of experimental period all animals were humanely sacrificed, and blood samples and vital organs were collected for appropriate analysis. Results showed a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in body weight gain (-102.2%), final body weight (-9.8%) and feed intake (-13.1%) of animals following sub-chronic exposure of WILLOSATE. The weights of the liver and kidney increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by 25.4% and 28.8%, respectively, while testicular weights decreased (p &lt; 0.05) by 24% with increasing doses of WILLOSATE. A decrease in sperm motility (-67.9%), viability (-52.7%) and concentration per vas deferens (-40.7%), and an increase in sperm major (28.1%) and minor (45.3%) morphological aberrations were recorded in WILLOSATE - exposed guinea pigs when compared to controls. There was a dose-dependent increase (p &lt; 0.05) in MCV and WBC and a decrease in Hb content and RBC, as well as serum content in total protein (-11.8%). The serum content of cholesterol (37.8%), urea (87.1%), creatinine (22.4%), ALAT (74.2%) and ASAT (88.7%) were significantly higher in treated groups compared to controls.

<Rec><Common><PMID>33555119</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>An efficient cephalosporin stewardship programme in French swine production.</Title>	<Abstract>By 2010, systems set up to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial usage identified a sustained increase regarding third- and fourth-generation cephalosporin resistance in French pig production. This sector mobilised and collectively committed to responsible action in the following months. This led to a multi-professional voluntary stewardship programme that was started in 2011. A consensus of veterinary opinion led to the definition of restrictive rules on the prescription of the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins targeted by the antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP). All pig sector professionals, including farmers, were informed. Existing monitoring systems for usage and resistance were supplemented by data from the records of veterinarians' cephalosporin deliveries and from individual pig farm surveys investigating antimicrobial usage. The second step, from 2014, entailed regulatory measures that consolidated the programme by setting quantitative reduction objectives and specifying the terms and conditions for prescribing and dispensing a list of critical antimicrobial molecules including cephalosporins. All the data sources confirmed a significant fall of more than 90% in cephalosporin usage in the French pig production sector between 2010 and 2016. Monitoring systems recorded that the resistance of commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates also tended to decrease over the same period. The stewardship programme proved highly effective in reducing usage and containing resistance, illustrating the efficiency of a well-defined multi-professional strategy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antimicrobial Stewardship</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cephalosporins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>France</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The scarcity and high price of poultry feed and veterinary services and the harsh environmental conditions with respect to thermal stress are some of the challenges that hinder optimal growth of the birds. Limited availability of feedstuffs, including crucial feed ingredients like maize and oil seedcakes, is an important challenge to the sector, since feed still represents a major cost of producing broiler chickens. Additionally, the problem of climate change, which has become a global concern, is the main problem in broiler production under hot and humid climate. Under high ambient temperature, feed intake decreases, carbohydrates metabolism and protein synthesis efficiency are disturbed. Lipid utilization is lower and glucose or insulin homeostasis is altered while fat deposition and oxidative stress increases. Several strategies are used to ameliorate the effect of heat stress in poultry. The objective of this review was to summarize the challenge in broiler production under hot and humid climate and different approaches to fight heat stress in poultry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hot Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tropical Climate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This, however, is associated with the declines in productive performance and systemic health indices. Sanguinarine may improve protein efficiency via decreasing the intestinal amino acid decarboxylation and stimulating the tryptophan-serotonin pathway. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of sanguinarine on the performance, egg yolk biochemical parameters, serum enzyme activities, nutrient digestibility, ovarian follicles, and hepatic health indices in laying hens fed decremental levels of crude protein (CP). For this purpose, 180 laying hens were allocated into nine dietary treatments with four replicates of five birds each. The experimental treatments consisted of three levels of CP (85.0%, 92.5%, and 100% of Hy-Line W-36 manual recommendation) and three levels of sanguinarine (0.00, 3.75, and 7.50 mg/kg) in a 3 &#215; 3 factorial arrangement administered during a 70-day feeding trial. Results showed that the decremental levels of CP led to significant increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (p &lt; .05), alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase (p &lt; .01) activities, egg yolk cholesterol concentration (p = .064), and hepatic fat and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents (p &lt; .05). It also caused the significant declines in ileal dry matter (DM) digestibility (p &lt; .05) and eggshell strength (p &lt; .05), and also tended to decrease CP digestibility (p = .071), Haugh unit (p = .057) and egg production percentage (p = .062). The interaction effects of the experimental factors indicated that dietary supplementation of sanguinarine, especially at 7.50 mg/kg, led to significant improvements in serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities (p &lt; .01), egg yolk cholesterol (p &lt; .001) and triglyceride (p &lt; .05) concentrations, eggshell strength (p &lt; .001), Haugh unit (p &lt; .05), hepatic fat (p &lt; .001) and MDA (p = .059) contents, ileal DM and CP digestibility (p &lt; .01) as well as egg production, egg mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR; p &lt; .05) in birds receiving decremental levels of CP. Taken together, the results indicate that dietary administration of sanguinarine could enhance productive performance via improving nutrient digestibility, hepatic health indices and fortifying systemic antioxidant capacity in laying hens fed low-CP diets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Benzophenanthridines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoquinolines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutrients</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33570258</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Temporal and spatial distributions of animal and human rabies cases during 2012 and 2018, in Tunisia.</Title>	<Abstract>Rabies is one of the most important zoonosis in Tunisia. In the last 6 years, a dramatic increase in the number of cases in animals had raised concern about the transmission dynamics of rabies and the effectiveness of established control measures. For a better understanding of the epidemiological features of rabies in Tunisia, data on animal and human rabies cases and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) protocol, for the period from 2012 to 2018, were analysed to describe the spatial and the temporal distributions of the disease and to guide targeted rabies control measures. Thus, the analysed data have shown that 2,642 animal and 25 human rabies cases were recorded between 2012 and 2018; only few case numbers were reported in wildlife. Time-related distribution showed that the incidence of dog rabies increases over the period of study, from 24,8/100,000 dog population in 2012 to 35,2/100,000 dog population in 2018. Dog seems to be the main reservoir of rabies as it accounted for more than 59% of the animal confirmed cases and the source for more than 80% of the human confirmed cases. Geographical distribution of animal rabies cases revealed the presence of clusters in the North and the Center of Tunisia; only a little number of animal cases were reported in the South. In contrast, the overall human rabies incidence was 0.03 per 100,000 population, during the period of the study. We have found that the incidence of human rabies increases by 13.6% from 2012 to 2015 and drops steadily by 23.41% over the second period (2015 to 2018). A high number of PEP was recorded during the 7-year period, with an average of 360 PEP per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Spatial analysis revealed the presence of clusters of PEP in the Northern and Central governorates. The present study pointed out the need to review the control strategy of rabies in Tunisia and conduct further studies on dog population to provide the basis for a new and efficacious policy of interventions and control program for rabies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tunisia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to identify the profiles of the Mmm strains isolated in Niger using the 'Multilocus Sequence Analysis' (MLSA) typing technique based on polymorphism analysis of housekeeping and non-coding genes. The investigation was conducted on samples (n=22) comprising of lung tissues, lymph node and pleural fluids. Following classical PCR, Mmm positive amplicons (n=6) were identified. These positive amplicons were then amplified using eight loci of the PG1 reference strain (LocPG1-0001, Loc-PG1-0103, Loc-PG1-0287, Loc-PG1-0431, Loc-PG1-0489, Loc-PG1-0523, Loc-PG1-0710 and Loc-PG1-0827). Sequencing followed by the determination of the profile of each strain by the combination of the allele numbers revealed three different MLSA profiles namely; A11, E01 and A15. The profiles A11 and E01 were previously identified. The novel profile identified in this study was named profile A15. The difference was detected while comparing sequences of non-coding loci. This novel profile was named 'A15' according to the similarities with African reference strain profile 'A00' at the seven loci level (loc-0103, loc-0287, loc-0431, loc-0489, loc-0523, loc-0710 and loc-0827). For CBPP control measures, identification and molecular characterization of Mmm strains is very important. Thus, the use of MLSA technique is relevant to identify profiles of Mmm circulating in Niger. Other countries where CBPP is still endemic are encouraged to use a MLSA scheme to address this issue and, most importantly, to rapidly trace back the origin of outbreaks, which will help reduce the transmission and spread of the disease. In addition, mapping the profiles of strains circulating in each of the countries of the sub-region is necessary for effective control of CBPP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Alleles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Base Sequence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multilocus Sequence Typing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoplasma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoplasma Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Niger</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33570263</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Cryopreservation of dog semen in a Tris extender with two different 1% soybean preparations compared with a Tris egg yolk extender.</Title>	<Abstract>Egg yolk is widely used as a cryoprotectant in dog semen extenders, but there is a risk of contamination with animal pathogens. In addition, egg yolk may vary in composition, making it difficult to standardize the extender. Lecithin is an animal protein-free alternative to egg yolk for semen cryopreservation. Recently, it was shown that 1% of soybean lecithin type II-S was better than 2% for freezing canine semen. The aim of the study was to compare two different types of soybean lecithin, with egg yolk as a control. Ejaculates from eight dogs were divided into three equal parts and diluted with a Tris-based extender, containing either 20% egg yolk, 1% soybean lecithin Type II-S or 1% soybean lecithin Type IV-S. The samples were then frozen. Sperm motility was evaluated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), acrosome integrity (FITC-PNA/PI) and sperm membrane integrity (SYBR-14/PI) post-thaw, as well as after 2 and 4 hr incubation at 37&#176;C. Post-thaw sperm chromatin structure assay and plasma membrane integrity were evaluated by flow cytometry. Total motility, sperm plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity were significantly better in the egg yolk extender than in the two soybean lecithin-based extenders. Individual motility post-thaw differed more than in the fresh samples, illustrating individual differences in tolerance to the cryostress. The DNA Fragmentation Index (% DFI) was significantly lower in the Tris egg yolk (TEY) extender compared to any of the soybean-based extenders. The number of high green stained spermatozoa were significantly higher in Type IV-S compared to the control TEY extender. In conclusion, egg yolk was superior to the two lecithin-based extenders to cryopreserve canine semen.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryopreservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryoprotective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Egg Yolk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Excipients</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lecithins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Preservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tromethamine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>33586350</PMID>	<Type>Comparative Study</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluating heart electrical activities and cardiac arrhythmias of Holstein cows during ageing by short-term electrocardiography in comparison with 24-hour holter-monitoring.</Title>	<Abstract>Short-term electrocardiography is one of the most suitable tools to study the electrical activity of the heart, but the use of a tool such as a Holter-monitor with the ability to assess the long-term of the heart electrical activity, can provide more accurate information about these activities by comparing the results. It is possible to understand the superiority of each over the other and the resulting differences. Therefore, 60 female Holstein cows in 10 age groups, including 1 day, 1, 3, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 years were included in the study (6 heads in each age group). Electrocardiography (for 5 min) and Holter-monitoring (for 24 hr) were performed from the entire study population. The Q, R and T amplitudes in electrocardiography were significantly higher than those in Holter-monitoring. The P, R and T durations and P-R, R-R, Q-T and S-T intervals at all ages were significantly longer in the Holter-monitoring than in the electrocardiographic method. The heart rate of animals was significantly lower in the 24-hr Holter-monitoring than in the short-term electrocardiography. The trend of changes of all parameters was significant during ageing. Cardiac arrhythmias included sinus arrhythmia and sino-atrial block, which were the most common cardiac arrhythmias in the 24-hr Holter-monitoring. It appears that long-term Holter-monitoring is a more reliable method than short-term electrocardiography to assess cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, the indicators of electrical activity of the heart (waves) in the Holter-monitoring method are significantly different from short-term electrocardiography, which is probably due to the collection of information over a long period and in non-stressful situations. Furthermore, it appears that the use of the 24-hr Holter-monitoring method is preferable to the short-term electrocardiography method to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart of cows at all ages.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrophysiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Antibiotic use in animals may lead to antibiotic residues in animal products, including meat. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the potential role of grape seed extract (GSE) in treating Pasteurella multocida infection in rabbits. For this purpose, 45 weaned male New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups; control, infected and infected-GSE treated. Experimental P. multocida infection in rabbits induced a remarkable decrease in body weight, body weight gain, as well as microcytic hypochromic anaemia, leucocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia. Also, a significant increase in the hepatic and renal injury biomarkers, in interleukin-6, total globulin, &#945;, &#946; and &#947; globulins, as well as a marked reduction in total protein and albumin, were recorded in the P. multocida-infected rabbits. Treatment of infected rabbits with GSE modulated most of these altered parameters. This study endorses the administration of GSE for the treatment of Pasteurellosis in rabbits. Further studies are required to identify the possible additional effects, appropriate doses and duration of the GSE therapy in rabbits Pasteurellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Grape Seed Extract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pasteurella Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pasteurella multocida</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At the 90 days of gestation, 300 healthy sows were randomly divided into three groups, and they received the basic commercial diet or added 5% P. purpureum and 10% P. purpureum, respectively. The experiment started from 90 days of gestation to parturition. The results showed that the total antioxidant capacity, immunoglobulins and serum equol concentrations of sows on 100 days of gestation and at parturition increased linearly (p &lt; .05) with the increase of the content of P. purpureum in the gestation diet. The 5% P. purpureum increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p = .027) and Actinobacteria (p &lt; .001) at phylum level, Coriobacteriaceae (p &lt; .001) at family level and Prevotellaceae_UCG_001 (p = .004) at genus level, and decreased the relative abundance of Escherichia_Shigella (p &lt; .001) at genus level. In summary, this study shows that the additive of P. purpureum can increase the concentration of serum equol, improve the antioxidant capacity and immune function of sow in late gestation. In addition, the additive of 5% P. purpureum in the diet might change the composition of intestinal microbiota of sows, particularly the relative abundance of Coriobacteriaceae (p &lt; .001) increased.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity, Innate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbiota</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pennisetum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Specific and unique anatomical characteristics of the ophidian heart such as the single ventricular cavity, a tubular sinus venosus opening into the right atrium, the presence of three arterial trunks and extreme mobility in the coelomic cavity during the cardiac cycle directly affect echocardiographic examination. Twenty-one awake, healthy ball pythons (Python regius) were analysed based on guidelines for performing echocardiographic examinations. Imaging in the sagittal plane demonstrated the caudal vena cava, sinus venosus valve (SVV) and right atrium and the various portions of the ventricle, horizontal septum, left aortic arch and pulmonary artery. Transverse imaging depicted the spatial relationship of the left and right aortic arches, the pulmonary artery and the horizontal septum. Basic knowledge of cardiac blood flow in reptiles is necessary to understand the echocardiographic anatomy. The flow of the arterial trunks and SVV was analysed using pulsed-wave Doppler based on the approach used for humans and companion mammals. The walls and diameters of the cavum arteriosum, cavum venosum and cavum pulmonale were also evaluated. This study should improve the veterinarian's knowledge of ophidian heart basal physiology and contribute to the development of cardiology in reptiles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Boidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography, Doppler</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 16 isolates were identified as A. viridans by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and 13 were characterized by both antibiotic resistance and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Based on antibiotic susceptibility testing result, eight antimicrobials could not effectively eliminate the present isolation (more than 40% of isolates can resist these antibiotics), while all except two strains were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Molecular analysis indicated genetic variation among these strains. This study is the first report detecting A. viridans from aborted fetuses in Korean domestic farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aerococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Republic of Korea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Despite significant advances in vaccination and new therapeutic agents, little attention has been paid to validate methods for the diagnosis of fascioliasis in animals. This study aimed to compare the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique with PCR assay for the diagnosis of F. hepatica in sheep. In this cross-sectional study, 195 stool samples were collected from sheep for 3 months in Lorestan province, West of Iran. Specimens' parasitological examination was performed by using the direct wet mount and formalin-ether concentration method. After DNA extraction from the samples, molecular analysis was done using PCR and LAMP techniques based on the Fasciola ribosomal intergenic spacer (IGS) sequence. Of 195 specimens of sheep, 11 specimens were identified as F. hepatica-positive infection by using microscopic, PCR and LAMP assays. Kappa agreement test results showed that there was a significant agreement between the results of microscopic examination diagnostic tests, PCR and LAMP (Kappa = 0.51-0.72 and p &lt; .001). According to the results of chi-square comparisons between parasite prevalence applying different techniques and variables of age, sex breed, and type of drinking water, there was no significant relationship (p &#8805; .05). However, most of the infected sheep with Fasciola were 3- to 4-year-old females, of the Lori breed and consumed tap water. In many endemic areas, successful prevention and treatment of fascioliasis in animals depend on rapid and accurate diagnosis. Based on the results of the Kappa agreement, the significant agreement among the results of the microscopic examination, PCR and LAMP indicates the accuracy and reliability of these tests in the diagnosis of F. hepatica in sheep. However, molecular methods, especially the LAMP technique, are suggested because of their higher sensitivity and reliability for the diagnosis of F. hepatica even under field conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Helminth</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnostic Tests, Routine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fasciola hepatica</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fascioliasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Molecular Diagnostic Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the metabolomic-level mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism in liver of slow-growing broilers are still obscure. The present study investigated the effects of HS on hepatic lipidomics in Chinese indigenous slow-growing broilers (Huaixiang chickens). The study includes two treatments, each treatment had 5 replicates with 4 broilers per cage, where a total of 40 eight-week-old female Huaixiang chickens (average initial body weight of 840.75 &#177; 20.79 g) were randomly divided into normal temperature (NT) and HS groups for 4 weeks, and the broilers of NT and HS groups were exposed to 21.3 &#177; 1.2&#8451; and 32.5 &#177; 1.4&#8451; respectively. The relative humidity of the two groups was maintained at 55%-70%. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics were conducted to evaluate the changes in hepatic lipidomics of broilers. The results showed that there were 12 differential metabolites between the two treatments. Compared with the NT group, HS group reduced the levers of hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/16:0), PC (16:0/18:2), triglyceride (TG) (16:0/16:1/18:1), TG (18:0/18:1/20:4) (VIP &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05), while increased PC (18:1/20:3), PC (18:0/18:1), PC (18:1/18:1), PC (18:0/22:5), dimethyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine (dMePE) (14:0/18:3), dMePE (18:0/18:1) and dMePE (16:0/20:3) levels (Variable Importance in the Projection; VIP &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05). In addition, according to the analysis of metabolic pathway, the pathways of linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism were involved in the effects of HS on hepatic lipid metabolism of broilers (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, HS altered the hepatic lipid metabolism mainly through linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway in indigenous broilers. These findings provided novel insights into the role of HS on hepatic lipidomics in Chinese indigenous broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Response</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Metabolome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Metabolomics</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Small ruminants and cattle are the primary reservoirs for human infection. This study was aimed to estimate the sero-prevalence of C. burnetii in the ruminants of the selected region in Nepal. Field visits were carried out at four sites in different geographical regions of Nepal. A total of 522 sera samples were collected from 118 sheep, 242 goats and 162 cattle with the history of abortion, anoestrus and infertility. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against C. burnetii using a commercially available ready-to-use ELISA test kit. The overall true sero-prevalence was 1.89% (95% CI: 0.33-3.45), the prevalence ranged between 4.35% and 23.21% in goats. Sero-prevalence in goat was higher than that of cattle and sheep which ascertained that total freedom from coxiellosis cannot be confirmed in Nepal. This could complement the impacts of other infectious causes of the infertility in the farm animals as well as the public health of the farming households.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nepal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Results of the cross-sectional study showed that 26.74% of the respondents never washed their hands before milking, 60.47% never washed the udder before milking and 54.65% never withhold consumption of milk from animals under treatment with antibiotics. The case-control study included household units with previous cases of brucellosis (53.33%) and those without (46.67%) over the previous 5 years and identified drinking of raw milk as the main risk factor for infection (OR = 26.44; 95% CI: 8.04-86.99). Pastoralists' unhygienic handling of milk from production to market is suboptimal and this is due to poor knowledge on hygienic practices, poor knowledge on the risks associated with poor milk hygiene and lack of sufficient and potable water for cleaning of milk containers. Many pastoralists still consume milk raw and this is a major public health risk for milk-borne diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hygiene</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kenya</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Hundred pneumonic lung tissues were aseptically collected from clinically apparently healthy camels showed no signs of illness at ante-mortem examination, from Tambul slaughterhouse, Tambul area, Gezira State, Central Sudan, between November and December 2018. Samples were collected based on presence of the pneumonic signs, at the tissue level, including congestion of the lungs, presence of abscesses, fragility, changes in colour and thickness of the tissue. In order to detect PPR viral antigen, haemagglutination (HA) test was employed on lung tissue homogenate, using chicken RBCs suspension, which gave a positive reaction in 17-19 min. PPRV antigen was detected in 98 of camel samples with an overall antigenic prevalence of 98%. Of note, the HA titres achievable ranged from 4 to 256 HA units (HAU) with mean titre of 14.4 HAU, whereas apparently most of the samples achieved HA titres of 8 HAU. The results demonstrated presence of PPR viral antigens associated with pneumonia in camels indicating exposure of these camels to PPRV and probably presence of subclinical infection. Infection of species other than small ruminants suggests the fact that camels are potential hosts for PPRV and might play a role (or not) in the epidemiology of the disease. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if camels are able to transmit PPRV for in-contact small ruminants or other animal species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abattoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-Petits-Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sudan</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-four Bulgarian White milk goats, aged 4-6 years, weighing 45-51 kg were used in the study. Doppler ultrasound measurements of the blood flow velocity in fetal heart were done at the end of first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and in the fetal aorta - at the end of the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Ultrasound investigations were carried out by transabdominal approach with linear and convex transducers, with frequency 8.0 MHz. Blood flow parameters that included maximum and minimum systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility index, resistance index and systolic/diastolic ratio were measured by spectral Doppler ultrasonography. The results showed that the highest maximum systolic velocity in the fetal heart was observed at the end of the first pregnancy trimester. Statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower values of this parameter were registered in the second and third pregnancy trimesters. A similar tendency was observed for minimum systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity and systolic/diastolic ratio. The pulsatility index and resistance index had similar values for the three studied periods. Examination of the fetal aorta showed statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) of minimum systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility and resistance index in the third, compared with the second trimester of pregnancy. The analysis of the results suggested that Doppler ultrasonography can be used to monitor fetal blood flow changes during the various stages of pregnancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aorta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Flow Velocity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embryo, Mammalian</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fetal Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Doppler</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The majority of emerging infections in humans are zoonotic. COVID-19 is an ideal example of a recently identified emerging zoonotic disease, causing a global pandemic. Anthropogenic factors such as modernisation of agriculture and livestock farming, wildlife hunting, the destruction of wild animal habitats, mixing wild and domestic animals, wildlife trading, changing food habits and urbanisation could drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans. Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting many emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks such as nipah, highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic H1N1, and COVID-19. There are many other potential zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever that may emerge in the future. However, we have a limited understanding of zoonotic diseases' overall risk in humans and associated factors that drive the emergence of zoonotic pathogens. This narrative review summarised the major emerging, re-emerging, neglected and other potential zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh and their associated risk factors. Nipah virus and Bacillus anthracis caused repeated outbreaks in humans. More than 300 human cases with Nipah virus infection were reported since the first outbreak in 2001. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) caused more than 550 outbreaks in poultry, and eight human cases were reported so far since 2007. People of Bangladesh are frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to close interaction with domestic and peri-domestic animals. The rapidly changing intensified animal-human-ecosystem interfaces and risky practices increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The narrative review's findings are useful to draw attention to the risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases to public health policymakers in Bangladesh and the application of one-health approach to address this public health threat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Communicable Diseases, Emerging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>One Health</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

According to previous investigations, this recommended coverage is always not achieved in Burkina Faso. This study was carried out to investigate reasons for poor vaccination coverage in canine population. Using a structured questionnaires, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the city of Bobo Dioulasso to capture data on drivers that affect dog owners' individual decision to vaccinate or not their dogs. Through a house-to-house approach, 239 questionnaires were administrated to dog owners during face to face interviews. The results indicated dog rabies vaccination coverage of 25.9%. Dog breed, origin and confinement status had a significant association with vaccination status (p &lt; 0.05). Owners of exotic and cross-bred dogs were more likely to adopt vaccination compared to owners of local-bred dogs. Dogs of bought origin were significantly more likely to be vaccinated among all dogs. Household characteristics including age of owners, level of education, employment status, means of transportation, perception of vaccination cost and level of knowledge about rabies were significantly associated with the vaccination status (p &lt; 0.05). The oldest dog owners, the owners having high level of education, having a car as means of transportation, having good knowledge of rabies and dog rabies vaccination, being employed and perceiving vaccination cost as affordable were more likely to vaccinate their dogs.

A total of 200-day-old unsexed Marshall Broiler chicks were weighed and assigned randomly into five experimental groups, viz. deep litter without access to run (DL), deep litter with access to Stylosanthes hamata (SH), Stylosanthes guanensis (SG), Mucuna pruriens (MP) and free run (FR) during dry season. Each treatment had 4 replicates of 10 birds. Data were collected on growth performance, behaviour, tonic immobility (TI), gait score and blood parameters. The data obtained were subjected to One-Way Analysis of Variance in a Completely Randomized Design. Results showed that the final body weight of birds in SH was significantly higher (p &#706; .05) than those of SH, MP, FR and DL which were comparable. The feed intake of the birds of DL, SH and FR was higher than those of the other treatment groups. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the birds on legume pastures was lower than those without access to pasture. The birds of SH, SG and MP spent higher (p &#706; .05) time drinking, preening, dust-bathing, spot pecking and walking standing behaviours while those in DL and FR spent more (p &#706; .05) time feeding. Generally, the gait score of the birds on the different legume pastures was similar but better than those without access to pasture. Tonic immobility of the DL birds was longer than that of FR whose duration was longer than those of the birds on the pastures. The study concluded that access to different legume pastures, particularly Stylosanthes hamata, improved the welfare of broiler chickens without adverse effect on the performance of the birds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Welfare</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mucuna</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poaceae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seasons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tropical Climate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The malformation is characterised by an increased or decreased number of cusps. Anatomical variations of the aortic valve that have been documented in humans include unicuspid, bicuspid, quadricuspid and quinticuspid valves. Two reports described a quadricuspid aortic valve in horses associated with either a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or tetralogy of Fallot. In this case report we describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings of a horse with a quadricuspid aortic valve as single congenital abnormality, referred with history of exercise intolerance and an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Limitations and risks of misdiagnosis that can be encountered with transthoracic echocardiography are also discussed. The reported case highlights the importance of echocardiographic screening in asymptomatic patients as congenital heart disease can be present without obvious cardiac signs. As advanced imaging on the equine thorax is still far from future possibilities for adult horses, this report may help to reach an accurate diagnosis with similar cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aortic Valve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quadricuspid Aortic Valve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Defects, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Another spayed female Shih-Tzu dog who was 15-year-old had biopsy-induced gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Three months after being treated with Toceranib, the dog developed GL that was diagnosed by PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement as T-cell lymphoma. An eight-year-old, castrated male Mongrel dog was diagnosed with mast cell tumour. The dog was treated with vinblastine, but 14 months later, GL was revealed. Fine-needle aspiration indicated lymphoma. The owner declined to investigate the cell lineage. All three dogs developed GL after chemotherapy. We suggest that secondary lymphoma can develop in dogs after chemotherapy for a primary cancer, and thus long-term follow-up is necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma, T-Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the optimal pretransplant conditioning treatment is unclear in canine allogeneic HCT. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for a nonmyeloablative HCT conditioning. Six healthy dogs were treated with 8 or 12 Gy TLI using VMAT. Haematological and physical changes were recorded over 8 weeks. To assess the effect of peripheral lymphocyte condition, lymphocyte subset and proliferative ability were examined. At the end of the experiment, necropsy was performed. All dogs showed mild-to-moderate neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and these haematological changes resolved spontaneously. One dog treated with 8 Gy TLI developed transient cutaneous infection. No major complication was seen in the other seven dogs. Myelocytes and erythroblast cytopenia of bone marrow were detected in two dogs treated with 12 Gy TLI. This study is the first report of TLI using VMAT in dogs, and results suggest that this regimen is a feasible nonmyeloablative treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphatic Irradiation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transplantation Conditioning</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The current study was aimed to examine the influence of antibiotic (Flagymox) and the microbial-based administration on carcass traits in Clostridium (C.) perfringens-infected Cobb and Arbor Acres broilers. A total number of 360 Cobb and Arbor Acres broiler chicks (180 numbers per breed) were allocated to four groups; negative control group (without any treatments); positive control group (administration of C. perfringens at the rate of 1 &#215; 10[9] cfu/bird via crop gavage twice daily from day 16 to 18 post-hatch); C. perfringens challenge plus antibiotic (Flagymox[&#174;]) group, and Clostridium perfringens challenge plus microbial-based treatment (Big-lacto&#945;[&#174;]) group. The results indicated that the Flagymox and Big-lacto&#945; treated Cobb breed group achieved a significant increase in their body weight (BW) than the positive control group at the third week post-infection. Also, the Arbor Acres breed gained significantly higher weight compared to the Cobb breed at the third week. Total weight gain (TWG) from 0 to the fifth week in the Cobb and Arbor Acres breeds were higher in the groups treated with Flagymox and Big-lacto&#945; compared to the birds challenged with C. perfringens without any treatment, thus, increasing the total return (TR) in the treated groups. Economic efficiency showed no significant differences (p &lt; .05) between the treatment groups of both the breeds. Although the treatment cost of Flagymox is higher than the microbial-based treatment (0.86 versus 0.35 LE), there were no mortalities reported in the microbial-based groups in both the breeds resulting in significantly low losses compared to the Flagymox treated groups. The groups treated with the microbial-based products in both breeds were superior in dressing percentage (75.16 and 77.06% for Cobb and Arbor Acres, respectively) compared to that of the other groups. In conclusion, microbial-based therapy improved the growth rate, carcass traits, survival rate, and economic efficiency in necrotic enteritis induced in Cobb and Arbor Acres broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridium Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridium perfringens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Each carcass and organ (lung and liver) was thoroughly examined through inspection, palpation and incision following the standard protocol. Identification of the parasites was performed macroscopically. The total direct economic loss due to meat's condemnation was estimated by adding weights of each organ or carcass part and multiplying individual organ totals by their 2016 market unit price. A total of 857,039 cattle were slaughtered during this period, 64,497 livers (7.5%), 31,401 lungs (3.6%) and the carcasses of 1,171 cattle (0.1%) were condemned due to lesions caused by parasites. The main parasitic lesions in the condemned livers were attributed to Echinococcus granulosus (4.2%), Fasciola spp. (3.1%) and Dicrocoelium dendriticum (0.1%). All the condemned lungs were due to E. granulosus (3.6%). Taenia saginata cysticerci were detected in 0.1% of inspected animals. Liver condemnation due to cystic echinococcosis was the highest in fall (4.7%, p &lt; 0.001); while lung condemnation was the highest during spring (3.98%, p &lt; 0.001). Liver condemnation due to Fasciola spp. was the lowest in winter (2.99%, p &lt; 0.001). Carcass condemnation as a result of cysticercosis was the highest in summer (p &lt; 0.001). Considering the 2016 market prices, condemnations due to the studied parasites caused direct costs estimated U.S. $ 3,191,879. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report estimating the monetary losses due to parasitic infections in the slaughterhouses of this province. Due to the high financial impact of the studied parasites, a control programme should be implemented to decrease this impact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dicrocoeliasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dicrocoelium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echinococcus granulosus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fasciola</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fascioliasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

L-carnitine, a biologically active amino acid, present in high concentration in the reproductive organs such as the epididymis, is involved in sperm maturation. The possible protective effect of L-carnitine in experimentally lead-induced male reproductive toxicity in rats was evaluated in this study. Thirty adult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. Group 1: the negative control group was treated with normal saline; Group 2: exposed to 50 mg/kg lead acetate (2% solution in saline); and Group 3: treated with lead acetate 50 mg/kg (2% solution in saline) + L-carnitine 100 mg/kg. At the end of the experimental period, body and testicular weights were determined, blood samples were withdrawn for hormonal assays of FSH, LH and testosterone. Sperm parameters as sperm count, morphology, viability and motility were measured. Testicular tissue homogenates were prepared for enzymatic assays and for measuring oxidative stress parameters. Lead significantly increased both oxidative stress and the concentration of lactate dehydrogenase-C in the testicular tissues with a decrease in sperm count, motility and viability. Lead acetate treatment, induced alteration in sperms with normal morphology together with reductions in the serum FSH, LH, testosterone, body and testicular weights. The concentration of 17&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was significantly reduced. Co-administration of L-carnitine significantly reduced testicular oxidative stress, improved sperm parameters, elevated serum FSH, LH and testosterone with an insignificant reduction in the testicular weight. The concentrations of 17&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase-C were significantly improved by L-carnitine. The overall results indicate that L-carnitine is expected to improve the lead acetate-induced male reproductive toxicity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carnitine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lead</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organometallic Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats, Wistar</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On ultrasonography, the spleen had multifocal hypoechoic lesions. Fine needle aspirates from the spleen and liver showed marked extramedullary haematopoiesis, an increased number of histiocytes, haemosiderin deposits and erythrophagocytosis. A tentative diagnosis of haemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma (HHS) was made, and the owners elected euthanasia. On autopsy, the liver and spleen were enlarged. The spleen had an uneven surface and a yellow-tan spotted appearance. Histologically, the red pulp was highly cellular and dominated by erythroid cells, as well as a population of larger polygonal cells and aggregates of histiocytes. HHS was confirmed by CD11d immunolabelling.

This study assessed the accuracy of published HG-based prediction models of the live weight of Ethiopian sheep breeds. Furthermore, the study identified accurate and robust models that predict the LW of the sheep using HG. Live weight and HG of 1,020 sheep from Bonga, Adilo and Horro breeds were measured. First, data collected from the study was used to gauge the preciseness of previously published prediction models of each breed. Second, the data of individual breeds were divided into a calibration set for model construction and a validation set for model validation. Live weight was regressed on HG to construct simple linear, Box-Cox, quadratic and allometric prediction models. Prediction error of published models was &gt;20%. Models constructed for each breed did not differ in R[2] . However, only simple linear models with transformed LW (Adilo: Log10 (LW) = 0.408 + 0.015*HG, Bonga: Log10 (LW) = -36.6 + 0.882*HG, Horro: LW[0.5] = -1.26 + 0.085*HG) had homogenous residuals and prediction error of &#8804; 10%. Heart girth models currently used to predict LW of Adilo, Bonga and Horro sheep of Ethiopia are not sufficiently accurate as they have PE higher than 10%. Prediction models generated by the current study could replace the published models for an accurate estimation of LW of the three breeds for husbandry, marketing and veterinary purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weights and Measures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feasibility Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organ Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although COX-2 is the isoform most studied and has been described in several malignancies associated with histologic criteria of malignancy and worse prognosis, COX-1 has also been linked to some forms of cancer. With the present review our aim was to summarize the current state of knowledge and clarify if and in which type of tumours COX-1 and/or COX-2 expression have real prognostic implications. We searched PubMed database for prognostic studies using predefined inclusion criteria in order to ascertain the prognostic value of COX-1 and COX-2 in malignant neoplasia in dogs and cats. Eighteen studies were analysed. COX-2 was shown to be a negative prognostic factor in canine and feline mammary tumours, canine mast cell tumour, canine melanoma, canine osteosarcoma and canine renal cell carcinoma. COX-1 showed a negative prognostic value in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We found high heterogeneity among studies regarding COX immunohistochemical evaluation methodology even in the same type of neoplasia pointing out the need for its standardization at least by tumour type. The available data support the use of COX-2 as a prognostic factor in canine (mammary carcinoma, mast cell tumour, melanoma, osteosarcoma and renal carcinoma) and feline (mammary carcinoma) cancers. For COX-1, its use is advised in feline oral SCC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclooxygenase 1</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclooxygenase 2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is a disease of small ruminants globally but also occurs in large ruminants, especially in yak in the Himalaya. Gid is a pathological condition in young yaks, mostly below 3 years of age. The infected animal displays a circling movement with the head tilting towards the location of the cyst of a tapeworm on the cerebral surface of the brain.</Abstract><Abstract>We conducted a study with the primary aim to gain an insight into yak herdsmen's practices to manage Coenurosis in the Laya administrative block of Bhutan.</Abstract><Abstract>All seven villages of Laya were included for sampling. Seventy-five out of 182 households owned yaks, and 54 yak-owning households were selected randomly. The government livestock officials of nine yak-rearing highland districts were also included in the study. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on a questionnaire survey and focussed mainly on herdsmen's practices to manage gid. Two sets of questionnaires were used for yak herders and livestock officials. Each predesigned questionnaire was semi-structured and consisted of both open- and closed-ended questions.</Abstract><Abstract>The study revealed gid as a major cause of yak mortality. Gid occurred more in winter during migration and most herders lost one to three yaks annually. Herdsmen kept an average of two watchdogs and dewormed them once annually. Similarly, calves were also dewormed once annually. The carcasses of dead yaks were fed to dogs. Livestock officials were optimistic about controlling the disease in the future, despite the yak areas being difficult to access. Most herders had not attended the gid awareness programme. The animal health worker visited herds once annually. In absence of animal health workers, most herdsmen resorted to different practices to treat affected yaks -the most common practice being surgery. Gid was mentioned to harm herdsmen's economy.</Abstract><Abstract>The study concluded that for effective management of gid in Laya, livestock agencies must create more awareness on gid, increase the frequency of visits by animal health workers to yak herds, and increase the frequency of deworming of watchdogs and calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bhutan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Taeniasis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sophorolipid (SPL), a surface-active glycolipid compound, has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity and stimulate cell proliferation. Thus, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of SPL on the gut turnover after the wound. The in vitro experiment with HT-29 cells showed the increased proliferation with increasing gene levels of collagenase-1 and matrilysin-1. Next, the 16-day in vivo experiment was conducted with thirty rats (14-day-old), and the allocation was performed according to their body weight (BW) into three treatments: control diet (CON), 48 ppm of oxytetracycline-supplemented diet (OTC) and 10 ppm of SPL-supplemented diet (SPL). Dietary SPL accelerates the growth of rats in overall periods, and intestinal permeability was lower in SPL at day 16. Villus:crypt ratio and the goblet cell count were also higher in SPL than in CON at day 8. Caecal Streptococcus spp. were significantly reduced with dietary SPL and OTC at day 8 and 16, and total short-chain fatty acid, acetate and butyrate levels were increased in the SPL at day 8. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that SPL could improve gut remodelling potential and modulate the gut environments, resulted in acceleration of post-weaning growth. Therefore, SPL could have a potential as a feed additive aimed at promoting repair system after wound in animal's gut.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cecum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HT29 Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Mucosa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oleic Acids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weaning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our previous TMT proteomics analysis found that three key proteins in the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, STAR, HSD3B1, and CYP11A1, may affect the litter size trait of Small Tail Han sheep.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was to better understand the relationship between polymorphisms of these three genes and litter size.</Abstract><Abstract>Sequenom MassARRAY detected genetic variance of the three genes in 768 sheep. Real-time qPCR of the three genes was used to compare their expression in monotocous and polytocous sheep in relevant tissues. Finally, bioinformatics analysis predicted the protein sequences of the different SNP variants.</Abstract><Abstract>Association analysis showed that there was a significant difference in litter size among the genotypes at two loci of the CYP11A1 gene (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05), but no significant difference was observed in litter size among all genotypes at all loci of the STAR and HSD3B1 genes (p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.05). However, STAR expression was significantly different in polytocous and monotocous sheep in the pituitary (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01). Tissue-specific expression in the ovary was observed for HSD3B1 (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05), but its expression was not different between polytocous and monotocous sheep. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the g.33217408C&#160;&gt;&#160;T mutation of CYP11A1 resulted in major changes to the secondary and tertiary structures. In contrast, gene polymorphisms in STAR and HSD3B1 had minimal impacts on their protein structures.</Abstract><Abstract>This may explain why the CYP11A1 variant impacted litter size while the others did not. The single nucleotide polymorphism of the CYP11A1 gene would serve as a good molecular marker when breeding to increase litter size in sheep. Our study provides a basis for further revealing the function of the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway in sheep reproduction and sheep breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Metabolic Networks and Pathways</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Genetic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Steroids</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of high-energy diets (HED) on obesity and oxidative stress in domestic pigeons. Forty-five adult clinically healthy-domestic male pigeons were randomly assigned to three equal dietary groups including low (2,850 kcal/kg), medium (3,150 kcal/kg) and high (3,450 kcal/kg) energy diets (named low energy diet, medium-energy diet and HED, respectively). All birds received formulated diets for 60 consecutive days. Several parameters such as feed intake, body weight (BW), average weight gain (AWG) and total weight gain were determined. Serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-, low- and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterols, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were evaluated at days 0, 30 and 60; and serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and cortisol were also measured at day 60. On day 60, five pigeons from each group were randomly euthanized and some parameters such as weight and relative weight of liver, breast muscle, and abdominal fat were determined. Furthermore, hepatic total fat content was also evaluated. BW, AWG, total weight, and circulating TG, TC, ALT, AST, ALP, MDA and cortisol in HED were significantly higher than other groups. Serum T-AOC in HED was significantly lower than the other groups. In conclusion, this study showed that increasing dietary energy up to 3,450 kcal/kg in pigeons led to obesity and oxidative stress in them. Accordingly, it could be stated that HED and obesity induce oxidative stress in pigeon and controlling the dietary energy intake of pigeons is necessary to prevent oxidative stress in them.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bird Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Columbidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Energy Intake</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Energy Metabolism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Obesity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MicroRNA-192 (miR-192) is related to fat metabolism. However, the relevant mechanism of berberine on lipid metabolism during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes remains unclear.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which berberine promotes the IVM and lipid metabolism of porcine oocytes via miR-192.</Abstract><Abstract>Ber was added to IVM medium of porcine oocytes. MiR-192 agomir, miR-192 antagomir and negative control fragment were microinjected into the cytoplasm of oocytes without Ber. Rates of oocyte IVM and embryonic development in each group were observed. The content of lipid droplets in IVM oocytes in each group was analyzed by Nile red staining. Expression levels of miR-192 and FABP3, SREBF1 and PPARG, were detected by qPCR and western blotting. The target genes of miR-192 were determined by luciferase reporter assays.</Abstract><Abstract>We found that Ber significantly increased the rate of oocytes IVM and blastocyst development, and decreased the area and numbers of lipid droplets in IVM oocytes. Ber significantly increased the expression of miR-192 in IVM oocytes, and significantly decreased the expression of SREBF1 and PPARG, which were target genes of miR-192. This study indicates that Ber promotes lipid metabolism in porcine oocytes by activating the expression of miR-192 and down-regulating SREBF1 and PPARG, thus, improving IVM of porcine oocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Berberine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipid Metabolism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>MicroRNAs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

During each 21-d period, cows received one of three total mixed rations as dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were three ratio of pellets (containing 50% ground wheat and 50% ground barley): ground corn on a dry matter (DM) basis: 1) 33.3:66.6 (low); 2) 66.6:33.3 (medium); and 3) 100:0 (high). During the experiment, the ambient temperature-humidity index was equal or more than 72, indicating that the cows were predisposed to heat stress condition.</Abstract><Abstract>Increasing the proportion of wheat-barley pellets in the diet had a minimal effect on sorting index of different particles during the first 6 h of the day. However, later in the day (6-18h), sorting against long particles (particles &gt;19 mm) and in favour of fine particles (particles &lt;1.18 mm) linearly increased with increasing the proportion of pellet; as a result overall daily sorting against long particles was increased with increasing the proportion of pellets. Although the average of daily eating and rumination was not affected by the treatments in the day times with high ambient THI, time spent for eating and rumination was low and eating time had more fluctuation for diet contained a high level of pellets.</Abstract><Abstract>Increasing the proportion of pellets of barley and wheat grains in the diet under conditions of heat stress caused more fluctuation in daily eating behaviour and cows were predisposed to sort against long particles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Response</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hordeum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastication</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triticum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zea mays</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twelve heads of healthy dromedaries were used; eight heads were dissected to obtain skulls for the fenestration of the sinuses, two heads underwent anatomical sections, and two heads were imaged respectively by radiography and CT. Sinus fenestration allowed observation of sinuses and their communications. In each dissected dromedary's head, the frontal sinus is a large compartment delimited by thick partitions. The sphenoid sinus is divided into small compartments by bony plates. The lacrimal sinus occupies a small cavity in the rostro-medial lacrimal bone of the orbit. In all dissected heads, there was neither palatal sinus nor ventral conchal sinus. Five images obtained by CT were selected with an excellent correspondence with the anatomical sections. These images allowed a good differentiation between bones and sinus cavities. The visualisation of the sinus cavities and their anatomical limits has better quality using the CT compared to the radiography. Radiographic and CT images are therefore very useful for the interpretation of clinical imaging studies of the dromedary's paranasal sinuses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Head</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paranasal Sinuses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skull</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate ovarian characteristics, and in vitro nuclear and cytoplasmic oocyte maturation in both breeds. One day after weaning, follicular phase ovaries were collected. Ovary length and weight were measured and the number of follicles (&lt; 3 mm and 3-8 mm) was counted. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected and matured for 48 hr. To assess cumulus expansion, COC area was analysed at 0 and 20 hr. Nuclear maturation and cortical granule (CG) distribution were analysed at 20 and 48 hr, and total glutathione (GSH) was measured at 48 hr to further elucidate cytoplasmic maturation. In first parity sows, a smaller ovary length and fewer 3 to 8 mm follicles were observed in ND compared to NL. For all sows, ND COCs covered a significantly smaller area at 0 hr, but a higher cumulus expansion ratio was observed at 20 hr compared to NL (364 &#177; 46% versus. 278 &#177; 27%, p &lt; 0.001). At 20 hr, more ND oocytes exhibited advanced stages of nuclear maturation, while more NL oocytes showed advanced stages of CG distribution. Nuclear maturation to MII stage at 48 hr did not differ between ND and NL oocytes (90.1% and 87.7%, respectively). Moreover, no significant differences were observed for GSH content or CG distribution after maturation. In conclusion, differences with regard to ovarian characteristics as well as to cumulus expansion, and nuclear and cytoplasmic oocyte maturation at 20 hr were observed between the breeds. Further studies are required to determine if this subsequently affects in vitro fertilization and embryo development.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embryonic Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fertilization in Vitro</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovarian Follicle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Approximately 80% of the world's population relies on traditional medicines for their primary healthcare needs because of their cost effectiveness and efficiency with no or minimal side effects. Zootherapy refers to the use of medicines that are prepared or derived from animals or from their products. The current study documented the folk knowledge related to the practice of various animal-derived products and ethnozoological based drugs used as medicines by the residents of the Cholistan desert of Bahawalpur (Pakistan). In this regard 46 knowledgeable and reliable elderly people, hakims and spiritual healers ranging from 35-60 years of age having knowledge related to zootherapy were included in the current study. A field survey from February 2006 to November 2007 was conducted by interviewing the selected respondents through a structured questionnaire. They provided knowledge regarding the use of animals and their derived products in traditional medicine. The zootherapeutic knowledge was based on both domestic animals as well as wild animals. A total of 20 animal species were included in the study, among which nine animals were domestic while 11 were wild animals. Among selected animals, nine were mammals, four birds, four reptiles and three insects. It was reported that camel was the most commonly used (n = 32 respondents) among mammals while Pigeon (n = 39 respondents), Spiny-tailed lizard (n = 41 respondents) and Indian honey bee (n = 27 respondents) among birds, reptiles and insects, respectively, have significant use for the treatment of different diseases. Based on this communication we could recommend that this type of abandoned knowledge should be considered for the management and conservation of faunistic resources. However, the advantageous role of animals and their products was reported but more extensive research is required to explore the bioactive constituents in the raw material of these animals responsible for their beneficial effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medicine, Traditional</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>33942545</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Schistosoma mansoni and soil transmtted helminths in olive baboons and potential zoonosis.</Title>	<Abstract>Zoonotic pathogens are among the most important causes of ill health all over the world. The presence of these pathogens in free ranging baboons may have significant implications for humans. In Kenya, the encroachment of wildlife habitats has led to increased interaction between humans and wildlife especially non-human primates. The current study therefore aimed at investigating any possible zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths of olive baboons (Papio anubis) at the human-wildlife interface in two park borders and a ranch in Kenya, namely, Tsavo West National Park, Tana River Primate Reserve and Mutara Ranch, Laikipia, Kenya. One hundred and forty-seven baboons were used in the study. They were trapped in the wild, sampled for stool marked and then released back to the wild. Gastrointestinal (GIT) helminths identified were Strongyloides, Oesophagostomum, Enterobius spp and Trichuris Trichiura from all the three sites while Schistosoma mansoni was only detected from Tsavo baboons and with very low incidence (2.1%). The prevalence of these parasites varied among the sites but significant difference in prevalence was only noted in Strongyloides and Oesophagostomum (p &lt; 0.05) among the three sites. This therefore implies that even with control measures instituted on the human population, baboons will always be a source of zoonotic GIT helminths especially S. mansoni even if the incidence are low. There is need to put in place measures aiming to reduce their interactions with humans and also try to control these infections in the baboons.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Helminths</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Papio anubis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Schistosoma mansoni</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The current study aimed at molecular and serological evaluation of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in dogs in Fars province, southern Iran. Blood samples were collected from 60 dogs in the three villages in Fars Province. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against L. infantum by direct agglutination test (DAT). DNA was extracted from each dog's buffy coat and tested by PCR, targeting the Leishmania ITS-2 region. From a total of 60 studied dogs, 25 (41.7%) were female, and 35 (58.3%) were male. Dogs' age ranged from 1 to 7 years, with a mean age of 2.97 (&#177;1.4) years. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in sera samples of 28 (46.7%) dogs, (titre &#8805; 1:320). Out of 28 seropositive cases, 13 (46.4%) were female, and 15 (53.6%) were male. Association between seropositivity and dogs' clinical signs was statistically significant (p &lt; .05). Leishmania DNA was detected in the buffy coat of 3 of 60 studied dogs which were all seropositive by DAT. The PCR products were sequenced and molecular analysis showed that two of the isolates were Leishmania infantum, and one was L. tropica. The high proportion of seropositive dogs indicates the important role of these animals in the epidemiology of the disease in the region. Infected dogs with or without signs, especially those that are molecularly positive, can act as an active reservoir of the disease in the area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Reservoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmania infantum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmaniasis, Visceral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

For centuries, it has been used for an array of ailments such as mild fever, wounds and burns, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, sexual vitality and fertility problems to cancer, immune modulation, AIDS and various skin infections. In present study, antibacterial activity of aloe vera gel extracts was tested against some common skin infection pathogens, that is, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus all were recorded positive. Antibiotic resistance and susceptibility pattern of above isolates were also studied against 10 clinically significant antibiotics (ampicillin [AMC], amoxicillin, augmentin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime [CAZ], cefuroxime [CXM], ciprofloxaci, tetracycline, cefpodoxime and imipenem). AMC and CXM were found to be most effective antibiotic followed by CXM with highest efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria. In case of CAZ showed highest efficacy was showed against Gram-positive bacteria. Aloe vera leave gel was extracted with four different solvent-like aloe vera leaf extract, root extract, leaf ethanol extract and root ethanol extract; however, Gram-negative as well Gram-positive isolates was found highest susceptibility with aloe leaf and aloe root ethanol extract. Moderate sensitivity observed with aloe leaf extract and aloe root extract against both Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacterial isolates. This result showed that ethanol extracts of aloe vera both leaf and root can be used alongside conventional antibiotics to fight agents of infections that are so prevalent in the skin infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aloe</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gram-Negative Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gram-Positive Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To reveal the effects of light on the laying performance of ducks and its possible regulatory mechanisms, Shanma ducks at 52 weeks age were divided into three group treated with different photoperiods of 16 hr (control group), 24 hr (long-photoperiod group, LP), and 8 hr (short-photoperiod group, SP). Laying performance, endocrine-related hormones and gene expression of three groups were compared. The results showed that laying performance was greatest in the LP group; including laying rate, average egg weight and feed-egg ratio. Compared to the SP group, GnIH plasma concentration was decreased in the LP group, whilst FSH was increased in the LP group. GnIHR gene expression in the pituitary and large yellow follicles were downregulated in the LP group. The expression of Mel-a in large white follicles, and Mel-b and Mel-c in the hypothalamus were also downregulated in the LP group. Altogether these results suggest that extended photoperiods may promote the laying performance of ducks by inhibiting the secretion of GnIH and the expression of GnIHR and melatonin receptor genes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ducks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hormones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Photoperiod</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study shows that in this family of birds, which are all related to Queen L, there is no advantage of having mtDNA with regard to race performance on the longer distances. The results of this study reject the hypothesis that mtDNA genes are related to long-distance performance. Actually, this analysis indicates that those birds in this family with no mtDNA from Queen L may have better race performance on the shorter distances than those with mtDNA. This suggests that there are other genetic factors which may be related to race performance in this family of racing pigeons.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Columbidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Mitochondrial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, in a number of patients, the therapeutic intervention has the purpose of slowing the progression of fibrosis and provide for optimal hepatic support. Recently the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) have been identified as a family of hepatic nuclear hormonal receptors, involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. The aim of this work is to assess the effect of mefepronic acid (PMPA), a PPAR agonist, on liver enzyme markers in blood samples of dogs with suspected hepatopathies. Twenty dogs, with suspected hepatopathies, were divided into two groups: ten of them received subcutaneously daily 10 mg/kg of PMPA for 7 days (treated, group T), while the remaining dogs were treated with a conventional supportive treatment for hepatopathies consisting of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 10 mg/kg PO SID for 45 days (control, group C). PMPA yielded a faster decrease in liver enzyme activities compared to UDCA, that in most cases was maintained after the suspension of the treatment. These data suggest that PMPA might be considered as supportive treatment for dogs with suspected hepatopathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ursodeoxycholic Acid</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Compared with other alkaloids from G. elegans, gelsemine, gelsevirine and koumine exhibit equally potent anxiolytic effects and low toxicity. Although the pharmacological activities and metabolism of koumine and gelsemine have been reported in previous studies, the species differences of gelsevirine metabolism have not been well studied. In this study, the metabolism of gelsevirine was investigated by using liver microsomes of humans, pigs, goats and rats by means of HPLC-QqTOF/MS. The results indicated that the metabolism of gelsevirine in liver microsomes had qualitative and quantitative species differences. Based on the results, the possible metabolic pathways of gelsevirine in liver microsomes were proposed.

During gestation, 40 multiparous Landrace sows were restrictively fed with either a control diet or a diet including 30% AH. Both diets had similar levels of digestible energy and crude protein, but the 30% AH diet had higher crude fibre levels than the control diet. After breeding, lactating sows were fed ad libitum with one of two isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets, either a control diet or a diet containing 10% AH. In gestating sows, AH supplementation was found to be associated with decreased digestibility of crude protein and dry matter (p &lt; .001), resulting in lesser backfat depth (p &lt; .001). However, in lactating sows, AH supplementation had little effect on digestibility and milk composition; moreover, it increased the feed intake (p &lt; .001) and decreased backfat loss (p &lt; .001) in sows. On the 21st day of lactation, suckling piglets in AH group showed significantly greater average daily gains (p &lt; .001), and average body weight and litter weight significantly increased compared with sows fed the control diet. In conclusion, AH-supplementation increased lactational feed intake in sows and improved the growth performance of suckling piglets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amaranthus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutrients</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dried papaya pomace was included in a common laying hen diet at 0%, 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% to evaluate its effect on egg production performance, egg quality and general health parameters in Bovan brown layers. For every inclusion level, three cages with ten 20-week-old layers were used, making a total of 120 hens. The effect of dried papaya pomace inclusion on egg production, egg quality and general health parameters was evaluated. Dried papaya pomace inclusion improved egg production and laying by 6.15% and 17% respectively, while it significantly decreased feed conversion ratio by 7.5%. Eggshell weight, thickness and strength of PP5 were higher than the control by 0.3 g, 0.8 mm and 0.43 kg/cm[2] , respectively.

Infectious agents are the most commonly causes of small ruminant abortion and many of which pose a serious threat to human health. The management of abortion outbreaks is essential to understand the transmission, prevention and control of the zoonotic diseases. This study aimed to increase the knowledge about the common known zoonotic pathogens causing abortion (Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia abortus and Toxoplasma gondii) circulating in Sardinia. In addition, the occurrence of other infectious agents that, until now, had never been identified in abortion samples and which might be cocirculating during the abortion outbreaks were also considered. In this study, 125 abortion samples collected from 91 small ruminant farms were screened for the presence of Babesia/Theileria spp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., C. burnetii and T. gondii by PCR analyses and sequencing. This is the first evidence on the presence of Theileria sergenti/orientalis/buffeli group and Eh. canis in 22 (22/125; 18%) and 26 (26/125; 21%) abortion products from small ruminants, respectively. Chlamydia abortus, C. burnetii and T. gondii were also detected in brain, liver, spleen and placentae at 46% (58/125), 34% (42/125) and 2% (2/125), respectively. This study highlights that pathogens with epizootic and zoonotic potential are circulating in the island and could be involved directly or in association with other pathogens as possible cause of ruminant abortion. Further studies are needed to fully assess the impact of Theileria sergenti/orientalis/buffeli group and Eh. canis on ruminant abortion and their real zoonotic risk in the island.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichia canis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Theileria</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To date, there is a paucity of information on the global distribution of pathogenic bacteria of medical and veterinary importance from diverse environmental settings. Therefore, this study was undertaken to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis to estimate occurrence of various bacterial species of medical and veterinary importance harboured by houseflies around the world. Published articles from 1980 to 2020 were retrieved from electronic databases and assessed for eligibility according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Seventy-eight studies were included in the review with only 44 studies being eligible for meta-analysis. Results indicated that eligible studies used in this review were from four continents, i.e., Asia (47.4%) America (23.1%), Africa (20.5%) and Europe (8.9%). The majority of the studies (56.4%) used the culture method for the identification of bacterial pathogens, while 30.7% used both culture and PCR techniques. For meta-analysis, we focused on five pathogenic bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. High heterogeneity was found among studies investigating different pathogens including E. coli (Q = 10,739.55; I[2] = 99.60; Q-p 0.0001), E. faecium (Q = 317.61; I[2] = 86.46; Q-p &lt; 0.0001), K. pneumonia (Q = 1,576.61; I[2] = 97.27; Q-p &lt; 0.0001), S. aureus (Q = 2,439.12; I[2] = 98.24; Q-p &lt; 0.0001) and P. aeruginosa (Q = 1,283.0; I[2] = 96.65; Q-p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, it was observed that houseflies carried a considerable number of susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that pose considerable threats to public health. Findings from this study have provided more insight on the vectoral potential of houseflies in the transmission of significant bacterial pathogens from different regions across the world. Further investigation is required to quantify the bacterial contamination and dissemination by houseflies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Houseflies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus aureus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computed tomography of the skull revealed a mixed osteoproductive and osteolytic mass of the condylar process of the left mandible, and cytologic evaluation of the mass was consistent with metastatic prostatic carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of mandibular metastasis of a prostatic carcinoma in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mandible</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Based on previous sequencing data of Qinghai Bamei pigs, a total of three novel candidate SSR loci were analysed in this study. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) was used for SSR genotyping, and association analyses between SSRs and the litter size of Qinghai Bamei sows was also performed. The results of genotyping showed that the (ATC)n -P1, (AC)n -P2 and (AC)n -P3 loci had 2, 3 and 18 genotypes, respectively; 2, 3 and 8 alleles were also identified at these loci. Except for the (AC)n -P2 locus, the polymorphism information content (PIC) values of other loci were greater than 0.25. Association analyses indicated that only the (ATC)n -P1 locus was significantly associated with the litter size of Qinghai Bamei sows (p = .047). Compared to 189-/189- genotype, individuals with the 189-/195- genotype had the senior litter size, which was 9.04 &#177; 0.21. Our results enrich the data on SSRs in Qinghai Bamei pigs and indicate that (ATC)n -P1 is a candidate locus for MAS in the pig industry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Litter Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microsatellite Repeats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Genetic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study reports on Q fever in patients presenting at Marigat District Hospital, Kenya, with febrile illness. ELISA was used to detect Coxiella burnetii phase antigens. Of 406 patients, 45 (11.1%) were judged to have acute disease (phase II IgM or IgG &gt; phase I IgG), 2 (0.5%) were chronic (phase I IgG titer &gt;800 or phase I IgG &gt; phase II IgG), while 26 (6.4%) had previous exposure (phase I IgG titer &lt;800). Age (6-10 years, p = 0.002) and contact with goats (p = 0.014) were significant risk factors. Compared to immunofluorescence antibody test, the sensitivity and specificity for phase I IgG were 84% and 98%, respectfully, 46% and 100% for phase II IgG and 35% and 89% for phase II IgM. It is concluded that the low sensitivity of phase II ELISA underestimated the true burden of acute Q fever in the study population.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coxiella burnetii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, District</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulin G</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kenya</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Q Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

There were concurrent intermittent neurological deficits in the left hind limb, and pain in the lumbosacral region and on dorsal flexion of the tail. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed an asymmetric widening of the left sacroiliac joint with loss of cortical margins, accompanied by mild osteolytic changes of the adjacent ilium and sacrum highly suggestive of septic sacroiliitis. There was also perilesional steatitis in the region of the sciatic nerve. An 8-week course of antimicrobial therapy was prescribed. Complete resolution of all clinical signs was noted at a 7-month follow up. Sacroiliitis should be considered as a differential for unilateral hind limb lameness with or without intermittent sciatic neuropathy in a puppy in the absence of other orthopaedic conditions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sacroiliac Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sacroiliitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sciatic Nerve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sciatic Neuropathy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Some physiochemical conditions can promote the conversion of proteins from soluble globular shapes into insoluble well-organized amyloid fibrils. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of temperatures on amyloid fibrils formation in vitro using the protein model of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). The HEWL fibrils were prepared at temperatures of 37, 45, 50 and 57&#176;C in glycine solution of pH 2.2. Under transmission electron microscopy, we found the well-organized HEWL amyloid fibrils at temperatures of 45, 50 and 57&#176;C after 10 days of incubation. Thioflavin T and Congo red florescence assays confirmed that the formation and growth of HEWL fibrils displayed a temperature-dependent increase, and 57&#176;C produced the most amounts. Meanwhile, the surface hydrophobicity of aggregates was greatly increased by ANS binding assay, and &#946;-sheet contents by circular dichroism analysis were increased by 17.8%, 22.0% and 34.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the HEWL fibrils formed at 57&#176;C caused significant cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells after 48 hr exposure, and the cell viability determined by MTT assay was decreased, with 81.35 &#177; 0.29% for 1 &#956;M, 61.45 &#177; 2.62% for 2 &#956;M, and 11.58 &#177; 0.39% (p &lt; .01) for 3 &#956;M. Nuclear staining results also confirmed the apoptosis features. These results suggest that the elevated temperatures could accelerate protein unfolding of the native structure and formation of toxic amyloid fibrils, which can improve understanding the mechanisms of the unfolding and misfolding process of prion protein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amyloid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circular Dichroism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microscopy, Electron, Transmission</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muramidase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temperature</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Most of the cortisol is assumed to passively diffuse from circulating blood into hair follicles and gradually accumulate in growing hair. However, our research with free-ranging grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) suggests HCC increases significantly within several hours following capture, a time too brief to be explained by this mechanism alone. In this study with captive grizzly bears, we sought to determine if a brief spike in blood cortisol concentration, thus mimicking a single stressful event, would cause an increase in HCC over a 7-day period. To do this, we administered a single intravenous dose (5 &#956;g/kg) of cosyntropin to three captive unanaesthetised adult female grizzly bears on two occasions, during April when hair growth was arrested and during August when hair was growing. In both trials, the cosyntropin caused a two-fold or greater increase in serum cortisol levels within 1 hr but did not appear to influence HCC at 1, 48, and 168 hr following cosyntropin administration. We conclude the cosyntropin-induced cortisol spike was likely insignificant when compared to the adrenocortical response that occurs in free-ranging bears when captured. We suggest further study with a larger sample of captive bears to evaluate the combined effects of anaesthesia and multiple doses of cosyntropin administered over several hours would better simulate the adrenocortical response of free-ranging grizzly bears during capture.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cosyntropin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hair</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ursidae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pens of finisher pigs (n = 36), with an equal number of barrows and gilts, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatment groups: basal diet composed of corn grain and soy bean meal with no supplement and formulated to contain 8.7% neutral detergent fibre (NDF), supplemented with 20% distillers dried grains with solubles (a byproduct of the ethanol production from corn grain) formulated to contain 13.6% NDF, primarily insoluble fibre or supplemented with 14.5% sugar beet pulp formulated to contain 13.6% NDF. Faecal samples were collected 6-8 hr after ceftiofur injection from treated and untreated pen-mate pigs on days 1 and 3 of the 3-day treatment regimen. Faecal concentrations of ceftiofur metabolites, including the major metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur, were analysed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Overall, the faecal concentrations of ceftiofur metabolites did not differ significantly between the dietary treatments. The mean concentrations of metabolites tended to be lower (p = .1) on day 3 compared to day 1 of the 3-day treatment regimen. Faecal concentrations of metabolites were not affected by the gender of the finisher pigs. The concentrations of ceftiofur metabolites in the faeces are likely reflective of the microbial activity in the hindgut. Our data suggest that the fibre level and source used in the study did not affect the faecal concentrations of ceftiofur metabolites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cephalosporins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In recent years, several genetic defect genes or haplotypes have been identified in Holstein cattle. A rapid and reliable microfluidic chip with Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assay was developed in our previous study for the detection of heterozygotes at eight genetic defect loci of bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD), Brachyspina syndrome (BS), complex vertebral malformation (CVM), Holstein haplotype 1 (HH1), Holstein haplotype 3 (HH3), Holstein haplotype 4 (HH4), Holstein haplotype 5 (HH5) and haplotype for cholesterol deficiency (HCD). This study aimed to extend that assay to include a newly identified genetic defect of Holstein haplotype 6 (HH6) and to estimate the frequencies of carriers for each of the nine genetic defects in six Chinese Holstein herds. Of the 1633 cows, carrier frequencies of the genetic defects were 6.92%, 5.76%, 4.46%, 4.30%, 3.62%, 2.94%, 1.86% and 0.37% for HH1, HH3, CVM, HH5, HCD, BS, HH6 and BLAD, respectively. No carrier was found for HH4. Notably, 27.43% of cows carried at least one genetic defect, while 2.27% and 0.12% of cows carried double and triple genetic defect alleles, respectively. The existence of genetic defects calls for routine molecular testing and effective management of genetic defects by avoiding carrier-to-carrier mating in production herds and eliminating or at least reducing the frequency of the defective alleles through marker-assisted selection in breeding herds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Haplotypes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukocyte-Adhesion Deficiency Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In Case 1, the in-line sampling device was able to detect certain segments of the milk-line contaminated with environmental bacteria, but not coming from the cows. In Case 2, 19 out of 25 pooled in-line samples were in agreement with at least one of the individual sampled cows shedding either Staphylococcus or Streptococcus spp. or both, which accounted for 76% accordance between both methods. The in-line system, although not perfect, provided a reliable method to detect individual cows shedding mastitis-causing organisms. In conclusion, the milk-line sampling device system was able to help identify foodborne pathogens. Regular monitoring of the microbial quality of milk through a milk-line sampling device is recommended for groups of cows within the dairy herd to detect potential mastitis-causing microorganisms. Furthermore, the sampling device was an effective tool to screen the efficacy of cleaning and disinfecting mechanisms of the milk lines to identify and control potential foodborne pathogens that are collected in the bulk tank.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Argentina</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Transhumance has been implicated in such spread as well as that of related tick-borne diseases (TBD).</Abstract><Abstract>Using a questionnaire survey and statistical modelling, this study explores the perception of herders about ticks and TBD in cattle, their practices in tick control and the social groups involved in cattle farming in eastern Burkina Faso (46 random herds) and in the northern Benin (44 random herds). Results show that most of the herders (79%) are from the Fulani social group. The principal and secondary activities of herders are respectively cattle farming and agriculture. The mean age of pastoralists is between 40 and 50&#160;years depending on the province of origin and 60% of the surveyed herds practice internal or transboundary transhumance. Herders have a clear knowledge of different genus of ticks except the genus Rhipicephalus. Their knowledge of TBD is very limited. These results also reveal that herders in Benin use less acaricides treatment calendar compared with those in Burkina Faso. Transhumant pastoralists (i.e. transhumant cattle farmers) plan more acaricide treatment and have more cows with lost teats (i.e. tick damage) than the sedentary ones. In addition, amitraz appears to be the main acaricide compound used by herders for tick control (68%) but its use is inappropriate and its source is frequently the unregulated market.</Abstract><Abstract>All of these findings can induce acaricide resistance especially as the inefficacy of amitraz against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has already been reported in previous studies.

Studies of relative gene expression require the identification of the most stable reference genes for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the reproductive tissues' response in laying hens kept in different production systems. The objective of this study was to determine the most stable reference genes of the magnum tissues of laying hens housed in two different production systems. Hy-Line Brown hens were reared under the same sanitary conditions until 15 weeks of age. Later on, they were transferred into two different production systems, conventional cage (CC) and cage free (CF), up to 82 weeks of age. At 50 and 60 weeks, a total of six hens from each production system were euthanized, and magnum samples were collected. The qPCR was used to determine the RNA transcription level of five reference genes, ACTB, 18S, GAPDH, MSX2 and HMBS. These genes were evaluated for transcript expression in magnum tissues by NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and RefFinder software. The results indicated that the most stable gene in the CF housing system was HMBS in three of the algorithms and in the CC housing system was the 18S, and the best combination of reference genes was HMBS/GAPDH in CF and 18S/HMBS in CC. In conclusion, HMBS, 18S and GAPDH genes could be used together as reference genes for the normalization of the magnum tissues transcript expression of hens in CF and CC housing systems.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Housing, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

For this, dogs of the Rhodesian Ridgeback (RR) breed were used because of a verified breed disposition for the development of BPH. Labrador Retrievers (LR) served as controls. The prostate gland status was characterised by the prostate gland volume, clinical signs of BPH (haemospermia and sonographic findings) and the plasma concentration of canine prostate-specific arginine esterase (CPSE). Breed specificity in the RR was expressed by a correlation of PRL with breed (p &lt; 0.05). Similar relationships existed in the dogs with normal CPSE (CPSEn) with respect to the IGF-1 concentrations (LR: p &lt; 0.05). The latter were negatively correlated with prostatic volume and age (both p &lt; 0.05). Concentrations of 25-OHD3 were tendentially (p = 0.18) lower in the RR with increased CPSE (CPSEi) compared with the CPSEn LR and RR showing clinical signs of BPH. A negative correlation between serum 25-OHD3 and age (p &lt; 0.05) existed in the CPSEi RR. Proof of 25-OHD3 in prostatic secretion proved to be a breed specific feature in the RR (p &lt; 0.0001). For all RR dogs showing clinical signs of BPH, a close to significant (p = 0.06) positive correlation with prostate gland volume was found. The results of the present study reveal no clear hints towards the significance of PRL and IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of canine BPH. In the RR breed there were indications of a causal relationship with age-dependent changes in the vitamin D metabolism. The data suggest the possibility of preventing or treating canine BPH by administering vitamin D or substances involved in the intraprostatic vitamin D metabolism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcifediol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prolactin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Hyperplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin D</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

After immunisation with inactivated bacterin, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae colonised on the respiratory tract and lung stimulates the humoural immune responses and produces IgG and IgA antibodies. ELISA is a widely used serological method to detect M. hyopneumoniae antibodies. However, commercial IgG-ELISA kit cannot distinguish between inactivated bacterin-induced hyperimmune sera and convalescent sera stimulated by natural infection. SIgA-ELISA method needs to collect nasal swabs, but collecting nasal swabs is not easy to operate. Establishment of a discriminative ELISA detecting humoural IgG from convalescent sera but not hyperimmune sera facilitates to evaluate the natural infection of M. hyopneumoniae after inactivated bacterin vaccination. We expressed and purified a recombinant protein named Mhp366-N which contains an epitope recognised by the convalescent sera but not hyperimmune sera. The developed discriminative IgG-ELISA could discriminate between inactivated bacterin-induced hyperimmune sera and convalescent sera and was reproducible, sensitive and specific to M. hyopneumoniae antibody produced by natural infection. Compared to SIgA-ELISA method, discriminative IgG-ELISA was more convenient to detect IgG antibody from sera than IgA from nasal swabs, although it has limited sensitivity in the early stages of infection. Additionally, to some extent, it has a potential to avoid the interference of maternally derived IgG antibodies. The established discriminative IgG-ELISA was efficient to judge the serological IgG antibodies induced from natural infection or inactivated vaccine stimulation and provided a useful method to investigate and evaluate the live organism infection after the application of inactivated bacterin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumonia of Swine, Mycoplasmal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this study, we evaluated antibody titers against virus genotypes A (BPIV-3a) and C (BPIV-3c). We conducted a serological survey and comparison analysis of archived serum samples from small and large ruminants reared in four Turkish provinces. A total of 1,307 samples, consisting of sheep (n = 444), cattle (n = 402), water buffalo (n = 261) and goat (n = 200) sera, were randomly selected from stock samples collected between 2015 and 2019 and screened by standard virus neutralisation assay. We found that 49.9% (653/1307) of all samples were positive for neutralising antibody titers. Goats had the highest titer, with total seropositivity of 63% (126/200), followed in descending order by cattle, sheep and water buffalo at 56.2% (226/402), 32.2% (143/444) and 26% (68/261) total seropositivity, respectively. BPIV-3c had the highest neutralising antibody rate at 34.3% (448/1307), whereas BPIV-3a had a 24.3% (317/1307) seropositivity rate. Neutralising antibody titers for positive samples ranged between 1/4 and 1/512 per the SN50 test. Seropositivity rates ranged from a low of 8.9% to a high of 18.3%. Our study was the first to compare antibody seroprevalence for two BPIV-3 genotypes in small and large domestic ruminants, which were shown to be more commonly exposed to BPIV-3c than BPIV-3a. This finding could have significant implications as current vaccines mainly use the BPIV-3a genotype. Further research can determine if current vaccines protect against different BPIV-3 virus genotypes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parainfluenza Virus 3, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of pathogens associated with PRDC, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and bacterial agents, such as Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, in clinically healthy pigs in Eastern China. Molecular detection revealed positive single-pathogen detection rates of 59.9%, 27.2%, 52.3%, 33.2% and 0.4% for PCV2, PRRSV, S. suis, H. parasuis and A. pleuropneumoniae, respectively. Co-infection with more than one pathogen was frequently detected in these samples, with PCV2/S. suis, H. parasuis and PCV2/H. parasuis mixed infection rates of 35.4%, 33.2% and 21.6%, respectively, and PCV2/S. suis/H. parasuis and PRRSV/PCV2/S. suis co-infection rates of 21.6% and 6.2%, respectively. These results suggest that mixed infections are prevalent among PRDC cases in swine, which may pose a greater threat to the health of herds compared with single-pathogen infections.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coinfection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In total, 120 ready-to-lay pullets, 18-week-old ISA Brown were distributed into six dietary groups, namely D1 (4% limestone), D2 (8% limestone), D3 (4% oyster shell), D4 (8% oyster shell), D5 (4% eggshell) and D6 (8% eggshell), to assess the effect of calcium sources on egg production, egg quality, dry matter and cholesterol content of the egg. Kitchen-extruded eggshell contained 98.52, 4.24, 29.75 and 14.82% DM, CP, Ca and P, whereas hatchery-extruded eggshell contained 99.20, 13.80, 25.53 and 13.87% DM, CP, Ca and P, respectively. Limestone and Oyster shells contained 99.60 and 99.51% DM, and 37.12 and 35.20% Ca, respectively. Body weight, egg, hen day and egg mass production, and FCR did not differ among diets (p &gt; .05). Egg production tended to increase with the increase of hen-housed egg production (p &lt; .001) in D6 , followed by D2 , D5 , D3 , D4 and D1 , respectively. The lowest production cost and the highest net profit were observed in D6 , followed by D2 , D4 , D5 , D1 and D3 , respectively. Diet with 8% Ca sources performed better than the diets with 4% Ca sources in terms of egg quality and dry matter content, where D6 was comparable to D2 or D4 . The weight of egg, albumen, yolk, eggshell, dry yolk and yolk-albumen ratio increased, while dry albumen and eggshell weight, eggshell strength and thickness, Haugh unit, yolk index and egg-specific gravity decreased with the increase in bird's age. The cholesterol content of yolk was statistically similar among diets. Therefore, no adverse effect of calcium sources on the production of laying hen was observed. Of these, extruded eggshell especially the 8% extruded eggshell may be beneficial to use in the diet of laying hen for producing a quality, safe and profitable egg.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcium Carbonate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Egg Shell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ostreidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Several methods have been developed over the years, but most of them were abandoned due to their limited efficacy. Currently, the only commercially available method for the separation of X- and Y-chromosome-bearing sperm is fluorescence-activated cell sorting. However, this technique is expensive and has limited usefulness for the industry, considering that it cannot produce doses of sexed semen with the desired number of sperm for artificial insemination. Immunological methods have emerged as an attractive alternative to flow cytometry and proteomic knowledge of X- and Y-sperm could be useful to the development of a new method. In this review, we identify the main applications of sexed semen, describe the existing methods and highlight future research opportunities in the field. We consider that immunological methods, based on sperm cell's surface proteins differentially expressed between X- and Y-sperm, could be an interesting and promising approach to semen sexing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteomics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Preselection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>X Chromosome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Y Chromosome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

So far, there is not any efficient treatment for this infectious disease in animals, although subunit vaccines can be a safe alternative. To this aim, we have designed a new chimeric OMP25-OMP31 antigen formulated in Chitosan nanoparticles and studied its protective efficiency in vivo. OMP25-OMP31 was produced using spliced overlap extension by polymerase chain reaction and the 3D protein structure and antigenic ability were predicted using computational tools. In addition, the humoural and cellular immune responses were measured by ELISA in six different experimental groups. The immune response showed chimeric rOMP25-OMP31 antigen-induced higher titers of IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; cytokines, while the lowest amount of IL-4 was dedicated to itself. Also, rOMP25-OMP31 stimulated higher titer of IgG than individual injection of rOMP25 and rOMP31 treatments and the cell proliferation assay demonstrated the vaccination with rOMP25-OMP31 elicits a vigorous antigen-specific cell proliferative. In addition, the challenge experiment showed immunised mic stimulated a higher level of protection than negative controls. Overall, the results of rOMP25-OMP31 could be promising for considering chimeric constructs as a feasible vaccine candidate for further investigations against brucellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella Vaccine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella melitensis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucellosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice, Inbred BALB C</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A total of 375 one-day-old male broilers (Cobb 500) were randomly assigned to five treatments included dietary PP levels of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 g/kg. Supplementation of PP at 7.5 and 10 g/kg resulted in significant upregulation of hepatic catalase (p &lt; 0.004) and superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1; p &lt; 0.05), which reflected in decreased concentration of circulatory malondialdehyde (MDA).

The antihyperlipidemic effect of PP was mediated through down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;). Hypotensive effect of PP was also observed at 7.5 and 10 g/kg as reduced heart weight and the right-to-total ventricular weight ratio (RV/TV) and decreased mortality from pulmonary hypertension. The hypotensive property of PP was associated with increased concentration of serum nitric oxide. In conclusion, this study revealed antioxidative, antihyperlipidemic and hypotensive effects of PP at 7.5 and 10 g/kg in broiler chickens exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. Health-beneficial effects of PP suggest this product as a promising multi-functional phytogenic feed additive for broiler chickens.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipogenesis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pomegranate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Meat inspection represents a long-standing form of disease surveillance that serves both food safety and animal health. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of bTB in livestock at abattoirs using a cell-mediated immune (CMI) assay, the gamma interferon (IFN-&#947;) assay. This cross-sectional study was conducted at selected abattoirs (low-throughput, high-throughput and rural/informal) in Gauteng province, where animals were also subjected to routine meat inspection.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 410 fresh blood samples were collected from slaughter livestock (369 cattle and 41 sheep) from 15 abattoirs, and analysed using Bovigam[&#174;] test kit with bovine, avian and Fortuitum purified protein derivatives (PPD) as blood stimulating antigens. The estimated prevalence of bTB in cattle was 4.4% (95% CI: 2.4%-7.3%). The prevalence of bTB in cattle varied between abattoirs (p&#160;=&#160;.005), ranging from 0% to 23%; however, there were no significant differences among genders, breeds, municipality, districts, origins of animals (feedlot, auction or farm) or throughput of abattoirs. The prevalence of avian reactors was 6.0% (95% CI: 3.6%-9.2%) in cattle, varying between abattoirs (p&#160;=&#160;.004) and ranging from 0% to 20.7%. None of the sheep with valid test results was positive for bTB and none was avian reactors (95% CI: 0%-15%).</Abstract><Abstract>The detection of bTB reactor cattle in our study clearly shows the limitation of disease surveillance using a meat inspection approach, as all the 410 slaughter animals sampled had passed visual abattoir inspection and been classified as bTB-free. Our findings therefore emphasize the risk of zoonotic transmission of bTB to abattoir workers and potential food safety hazard to consumers. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for the use of the IFN-&#947; assay to reduce this risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tuberculosis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Abattoirs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interferon-gamma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>South Africa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Small or moderate facial/nasal defects can be closed primarily or left for second-intention healing. However, larger defects require the application of composite tissue or labial advancement flaps. Axial pattern flaps based on the caudal auricular artery, superficial temporal artery (STA), angularis oris artery, and other cutaneous arteries have been reported. In our case, we aim to report the reconstruction of a large composite defect of the rostral and dorsal nasal regions in a dog using an augmented, axial myocutaneous flap based on bilateral STAs. This is a clinical report on a spayed female mixed-breed dog (age, 7 years; weight, 15 kg), in which a large-scale nasal-facial composite tissue defect was surgically reconstructed using an axial myocutaneous flap based on bilateral STA branches. A delay technique was applied to prefabricate the flap to enrich the blood supply. New nostrils were created on a folded, rostral hard palate. As a result, the axial tube rotational flap was successfully transferred. The use of delay technique for prefabricating the tube flap optimized its size and survival. In addition to the folded rostral hard palate, the flap fully closed the defects on the face and nose. Functional and cosmetic outcomes were satisfactory, with minimal donor-site morbidity. In, conclusion, a large-scale nasal-facial defect in a dog was successfully reconstructed using an augmented tube pedicle flap based on the bilateral STAs, which may, thus, be used to repair very large facial-nasal defects in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Face</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myocutaneous Flap</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We investigated follicular development in queens treated with a combination of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and evaluated the effects of vaginal stimulation by a tomcat on ovulation induction. A hormonal treatment was administered using a simple crossover design. Four queens were administered 150 IU of eCG (day 1) and 250 IU of hCG on day 5 and 6. Half of the queens were mated with a vasectomised tomcat for 3 days after hCG injection. Ultrasound imaging of the ovaries clamped at a subcutaneous site was performed once a day from day 1 to 7, and on day 13, and the serum concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone were examined on day 1, 5, 7 and 13. The mean number of follicles gradually increased with the eCG treatment and decreased after hCG injection. The ovulation rate of follicles was significantly higher in the vaginal stimulation group (70.0%) than in the control group (42.6%). During the hormonal treatments, the serum concentration of oestradiol and progesterone did not differ between the two groups. Ultrasound imaging of the ovaries clamped at a subcutaneous site showed that eCG and hCG treatment promoted the follicular growth and corpus luteum formation, respectively. The combination of hCG injection with vaginal stimulation by a vasectomised tomcat enhanced the ovulation rate of follicles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chorionic Gonadotropin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gonadotropins, Equine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovulation Induction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Only animals with clinical symptoms of piroplasmosis and/or anaplasmosis were checked for tick infestation. Among the 43 examined sheep, 58 &#177; 15% were infested by ticks. A total of 185 adult ticks (100 males and 85 females) were collected from the 25 sheep. Two tick genera, Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma consisting of four species were collected, Rhipicephalus bursa was the most frequent tick (164/185; 88.6 &#177; 4.6%), followed by Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (16/185; 8.6 &#177; 4%), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (4/185; 2.2 &#177; 2.1%) and Hyalomma scupense (1/185; 0.5 &#177; 1%). Mean overall tick infestation intensity was 7.4. Mixed infestations with two tick species were found in 10 sheep (23.3 &#177; 12.6%). All farmers (34/34) used ivermectin, and only 11% of them used acaricide to control ticks. The majority of R. bursa ticks (87/185; 45 &#177; 7%) were located on the ears 37/185; 20 &#177; 6%) and the testicles (50/185; 27 &#177; 6%).

Five fragments were collected from the entire length of the esophageal wall in five goats and four roe deer and subjected to microscopic and morphometric analyses. All layers of the esophageal wall except the tela submucosa were found to be thicker in the goats. In both species, the esophagus was lined by parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, and the tela submucosa was deprived of glands along its entire length. However, the structure of the lamina muscularis mucosae was better developed in goats: it was found to be discontinuous in the proximal part, and then became fused in the cervical part, that is around the most proximal quarter of its length. In contrast, in roe deer, the lamina muscularis mucosae began as sparse, thin muscle bundles at the pharyngeal-esophageal junction, which thickened and clustered further down the esophagus, but did not fuse. Our findings regarding the microscopic structure of the ruminant esophagus are not fully consistent with the widely-accepted view and suggest that the histological structure of the esophagus demonstrates interspecies variation within this large suborder. More precisely, species-specific differences can be seen regarding the presence of esophageal glands and parakeratinized epithelium, and in the organization of the lamina muscularis mucosae.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deer</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophagus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ruminants</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It makes up about 85% of the total weight of the brain. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a protein found in neurons of both the peripheral and central nervous system that appears to convey some resilience to hypoxia, while the hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif-1&#945;) is a dimeric protein complex that plays an integral role in the body's response to low oxygen concentrations, or hypoxia. The study examines the expression of Ngb and Hif-1&#945; in the telencephalon of adult yak in the telencephalon. The immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot (WB) were employed to investigate Ngb and Hif-1&#945; expression in the telencephalon. Ngb and Hif-1&#945; are significantly expressed in all tissues of the telencephalon except the hypothalamus. The cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and corpus callosum recorded the highest expression but not significant. The overall expression revealed that Ngb expression was higher as compared to Hif-1&#945;. The IHC results also showed that the expression of Ngb and Hif-1&#945; were higher in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and corpus callosum as compared to other regions. The results suggested that Ngb and Hif-1&#945; expression influence the adaptive mechanism of yak to the high altitude environment. Both Ngb and Hif-1&#945; participate in oxygen transports throughout the telencephalon and have functions in neuroprotection. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of adaptation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hippocampus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuroglobin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

According to research results in various species, ginger seems to have strong antioxidant properties (due to the presence of active phenolic compounds) and androgenic activity. Ginger improves semen quality and increases fertility of sperm by disrupting the production of free radicals, dissolving oxidative chain reactions, reducing oxidative stress and altering the levels of gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH) and sex hormones (such as testosterone). The antioxidant and androgenic properties of ginger give a sperm with normal morphological structure (head, middle and tail) and more integrated chromatin. The rate of DNA failure and damage to the mitochondrial genome in these cells is minimal and they have the most progressive motility, the highest viability and the best fertility. Therefore, the use of the ginger significantly improves the biological parameters of sperm (number, total motility, survival rate and normal morphology) and also increases all specialized fertility indicators of sperm. Tacking account of lacking literature and possibility of toxicity and adverse effect of ginger on vital organ, further clinical trial especially on evaluating the safety and clinical effect must be considered. Also, dose and duration of consumption by monitoring of health indicators and biochemical changes in all species such as human, animal and poultry must be applied.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Laboratory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fertility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zingiber officinale</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sperm Motility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

With community-acquired infections on the rise, it is important to identify reservoirs of the pathogen. Companion animals can be asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile and may therefore represent a reservoir, but epidemiological studies of C. difficile within the pet-owner unit are needed, along with validated methods to detect C. difficile in both people and animals. The goal of this study was to assess the performance of commercial qPCR assays and a multiplex PCR for C. difficile compared to toxigenic culture. These assays were tested on up to 103 fecal samples from puppies, a population in which the prevalence of C. difficile is the highest. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values were respectively 84.2%, 87.7%, 61.5%, and 95.9% for the Cepheid GeneXpert; 66.7%, 66.7%, 29.6%, and 90.9% for the DiaSorin Simplexa; and 94.4%, 85.0%, 65.4%, and 98.1%, for the multiplex qPCR. The agreement was highest between the GeneXpert and the multiplex PCR (90.1% agreement, with a kappa statistic of 0.77). For diagnostic purposes, the positive predictive values of the assays were low. However, the high sensitivities of the assays could render them useful for epidemiologic purposes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Toxins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridioides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clostridioides difficile</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Knowledge about morphological features of cell differentiation and proliferation along the developing tubule is insufficient, which hinders identification of the cellular origin.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aimed to investigate ultrastructures of the proximal tubule at different stages of nephrogenesis.</Abstract><Abstract>Electron microscopy was used and guided by computer-assisted tubular tracing to identify the cellular structures.</Abstract><Abstract>Renal vesicles and S-shaped bodies revealed more proliferative features, such as densely-packed fusiform-shaped cells with numerous protein-producing organelles than membrane specializations typical for mature tubules. At the capillary-loop stage the proximal tubules demonstrated all characteristics of the mature tubules, but not as developed, including shorter but densely packed microvilli, fewer lateral processes with cell-cell contacts, lower basal membrane infoldings, and lower mitochondrial volume density. However, they exhibited an elaborated endocytic system above the nucleus, indicating a membrane transport is being established. Abundant free- and endoplasmic reticulum-adhered ribosomes and Golgi complexes reflected active protein synthesis for cell growth and proliferation. Interestingly, electron dense cells were occasionally intermixed with electron lucent cells characterized by various organelles in less cytosol and a larger nucleus with abundant euchromatin, which is a feature of active proliferation.</Abstract><Abstract>These ultrastructures indicate that the morphogenesis of the developing proximal tubule corresponds to the gradually established physiological activities.

Over a 30-day period, one group of dogs received the supplement, and another group a placebo. Twelve behavioural variables were recorded in a series of four subtests (ST1-ST4) on days 0, 15 and 30. Saliva cortisol levels were measured before and after each set of STs.</Abstract><Abstract>The dogs rated as more fearful displayed significantly higher cortisol values before the day 0 test session, were less active, spent less time playing with the experimenter, and approached the unfamiliar object less frequently. The owners did not correctly guess whether their dog had received the supplement or not. Behaviours of dogs were significantly different across the three sessions, with significant increases of stress-related behaviours (time spent in the door zone, number of interactions with the door, of whining, and of lip-licking). Conversely time spent with the experimenter increased, interactions and curiosity for the novel object and play with the experimenter decreased, presumably due to a habituation process. This suggests that the design of the four subtests session was relevant to test for mild stressors situations. Moreover, supplemented and placebo dogs responded differently to the three test sessions, indicating a supplement effect on dogs' behaviours and their adaptation to mild stressors situations.</Abstract><Abstract>The trial results suggested that the supplement facilitates activity and curiosity in a familiar environment, promotes dog-human interactions with an increased human familiarity, and tends to reduce subtle stress behaviours.

A total of 396 1-day-old male chicks (Arbor Acres) were randomly assigned to six dietary treatments containing EP at 0 (EP0), 1000 (EP1000), 2500 (EP2500), 4000 (EP4000), 5500 (EP5500), and 7000 (EP7000) mg/kg levels for a 35-day feeding trial. At the end of feeding trail, six birds (one bird from each replicate cage) were randomly selected from each treatment and then slaughtered for relative organ weight analysis. The results showed that the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius were increased in the EP1000 group (p &lt; 0.05), and then three bursa of Fabricius samples from each group (EP0 and EP1000) were randomly selected for RNA-seq analysis. The results of RNA-seq analysis showed that there were 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EP0 and EP1000 groups, among the DEGs, 6 genes were upregulated and 14 genes were downregulated by EP1000 supplementation (p-adjust &lt; 0.05). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested that the DEGs were mainly enriched in negative regulation of toll-like receptor 9 signaling pathway (p-corrected &lt; 0.05). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in phagosome, mitophagy-animal, Salmonella infection, autophagy-animal signaling pathways (p-corrected = 0.081).

A secondary objective was to examine the physical and chemical characteristics of the ruminal fluid in affected cattle. A total of 20 cattle clinically diagnosed with acute ruminal acidosis and eight clinically normal cattle were included in this study. The results showed that decrease of ruminal pH changed the ruminal fluid colour, odour and consistency, as well as decreased the sedimentation time, increased the methylene blue reduction time, and decreased ruminal microflora motility. The study indicated that the concentration of 2,3-BPG, BPGM and BPGP decreased with the decrease of ruminal pH, while 3-PG concentration was not affected with the decrease of ruminal pH. In conclusion, 2,3-BPG could play a role in the pathogenesis of ruminal acidosis, and thus, the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate is important, particularly in severe cases, to correct any systemic acidosis that can decrease 2,3-BPG concentration and results in tissue hypoxia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>2,3-Diphosphoglycerate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Acidosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A rabbit model of weight gain and weight loss was constructed using two rabbit groups and two growth stages. Stage 1 included control group1 fed a commercial diet(CG1) and experimental group1 fed a high fat diet (EG1). Stage 2 include control group2(CG2) and experimental group2 (EG2) both fed a restricted commercial diet. We detected differences in blood biochemical indicators as well as changes in intramuscular adipose cells and intramuscular fatty acid content in control and experiment groups at two stages. High fat induction can make rabbits become obese, have higher concentrations of glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and free fatty acid (FFA), and lower concentrations of insulin (INS). In addition, a high-fat diet promotes hypertrophy of precursor adipocytes in femoral muscles. Conversely, a restricted diet causes weight loss, decreases the concentration of TG, FFA, and INS in CG2 and EG2, and increases the deposition of unsaturated fatty acids in the femoral muscle. The content of monounsaturated trans oleic acid (C18:1n-9T) in EG2 was significantly higher than in CG2, whereas oleic acid (C18:1n-9C) was significantly lower in EG2 than in CG2. The polyunsaturated fatty acids Linolenate (C18:3 n-3) and cis-5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoate (C20:5 n-3) increased in CG2 and EG2. The content of Linoleate (C18:2 n-6) and &#947;-Linolenic acid (C18:3 n-6) significantly increased in CG2. The content of cis-11,14-Eicosatrienoic acid (C20:2) decreased significantly in CG2, but increased significantly in EG2.Thus, a high-fat diet can increase the formation of unhealthy fatty acids. Conversely, weight loss due to a restricted diet leads to an increase in unsaturated fatty acids in the femoral muscle, indicating that it reduces obesity symptoms and it may improve meat quality in rabbit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adipocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids, Unsaturated</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triglycerides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Antioxidant activities of different concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts were evaluated with DPPH assay. Semen samples were taken from three fertile adult rams. After diluting semen with Tris-base extender, different concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata (30, 300, and 3000 &#956;g/ml) extracts were used under normal and induced OS conditions. The group not receiving any supplements was considered as control group. A total of 50 &#956;M hydrogen peroxide was used to induce OS. MTT solution was added to each of treatment groups which were kept in an incubator at 37&#176;C for 2 h. After incubation, readings were obtained by ELISA reader. DNA integrity and LPO were determined with acridine orange (AO) staining and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. Higher concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts preserved viability and DNA integrity while reducing MDA concentrations compared to other treatment groups. Also, under induced OS, higher concentrations of both extracts reduced detrimental effects of H2 O2 . In conclusion, it seems that addition of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts can reduce induced OS in spermatozoa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Terminalia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The histopathological investigation revealed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis and the infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages at the dermal-epidermal junction around the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Moreover, edema of the basal layer and melanin migration from the epidermis to the dermis were observed. The patient underwent treatment with immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone, antibiotic therapy, and baths in anti-seborrheic shampoos and displayed resolution. However, recurrence was observed after one month. Consequently, the patient received cyclosporine A, in addition to the aforementioned treatment and the lesions resolved without relapse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis, Exfoliative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epidermis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recurrence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of the present study is to explore the ethnoveterinary medicinal practices in three different communities and discuss the cross-cultural consensus on the usage of medicinal plants for the treatment of animals. The field survey was conducted by the animal healers of the area during the different seasons of plant growth. A total of 83 informants were interviewed through Semi-structured interview involving experts of traditional knowledge in 21 localities of the three regions (Zhob, D. I. Khan and Mianwali) were conducted. Findings of the study were quantitatively analyzed through the informant consensus factors to identify the homogeneity information provided by the informants. Furthermore, cross-culture consensuses were analyzed and recorded data were represented in a tabulated and Venn diagrams. In particularly, 59 species of plants were documented in the comparative analysis. Among them, 32 plant species were recorded in Pashto community, while Punjabi and Sarakai communities exhibited nine and four plant species, respectively. Whereas cross-cultural analysis showed 14 medicinal plants that were commonly utilized by three different ethnic communities, that indicated low interregional consensus in regard to ethnoveterinary practices of medicinal plants. The current study showed that different communities and ethnic groups sharing some traditional knowledge and cross-culturally approaches have been reported from traditional uses of plants against livestock's diseases. Therefore, current findings are the opportunities to scrutinize the plants for the discovery of new drug sources for humans and animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethnicity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phytotherapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plants, Medicinal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence in three descendant breeds of the extinct Zaupel sheep, firstly. Their investigation was carried out in order to prove the common origin of Waldschaf (Austria), Bovec sheep (Slovenia) and Cikta (Hungary). A total of 118 biological samples were taken from non-related representatives of the three breeds between 2015 and 2017. A newly designed primer pair was also used to amplify the segment (1180 bp) to be tested. The total number of haplotypes in the whole study population was 49. The majority of which fell into haplogroup B. The significant negative value of the Fu's Fs statistic (Fs statistic = -3.296, p = 0.013) based on haplotype frequencies demonstrated a moderate foreign gene flow. As a novel observation haplogroups C and D appeared in Cikta and Bovec sheep, respectively. The Tajima D-test value in the entire study population was -0.914 (p &gt; 0.10), meaning that the separation of the three descendant breeds did not cause genetic drift, these are collectively in genetic equilibrium. The genetic information confirmed the common origin of the breeds known from the breed history.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Mitochondrial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Europe</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Haplotypes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Macrophages within these granulomas have been identified as a new small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) replication site in naturally infected animals. Diagnosis of Al hydroxide-induced granulomas in sheep is mostly based on postmortem observations but little information is available on in vivo detection. Computed tomography (CT) is used for studying these reactions in other animal species. To determine if CT could be a tool for in vivo diagnosis and research of subcutaneous Al hydroxide-induced granulomas in sheep. A retrospective survey on thoracic CT scans was performed on 46 adult sheep. Analysis included absence or presence, number and location of subcutaneous nodules. Thoracic CT scans and pathological studies were prescribed to two further sheep. Single or multiple subcutaneous nodules were detected in 26 (56.52%) sheep. One or two nodules per animal were most often observed (36.95%). Size ranged between 1.5 and 4.5 cm. Pre-contrast two-dimensional (2D) CT images showed focal or multifocal increases in subcutaneous tissue thickness. Post-contrast 2D CT images revealed hypointense areas in the centre. Histopathology indicated the presence of granulomas composed by a large number of activated macrophages, surrounding a central core of necrosis. Large intracytoplasmic Al-positive aggregates were demonstrated by lumogallion staining. CT is a useful tool to detect subcutaneous Al hydroxide-induced granulomas in vivo in sheep. CT provides a diagnostic and research tool that can be very useful in future works in Al hydroxide-induced pathology, SRLV infection, or both.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aluminum Hydroxide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Granuloma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lentivirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to compare the differences in the transcriptomes of the ovary of Lingyun black-bone chickens with relatively high and low egg-laying rates and screen candidate genes related to the egg-laying rate. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to explore the chicken transcriptome from the ovarian tissue of six Lingyun black-bone chickens with high (group G, n = 3) and low (group D, n = 3) egg-laying rates. The results showed that 235 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the chickens with high and low egg-laying rates; among them, 209 DEGs were up-regulated and 26 DEGs were down-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the up-regulated 209 DEGs were enriched in 50 GO terms and the down-regulated 26 DEGs were enriched in 40 GO terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in 25 pathways and down-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in three pathways. Among the pathways, we found the longevity regulating pathway-multiple species pathway, Estrogen signalling pathway and PPAR signalling pathway may have an essential function in regulating the egg-laying rate. The results highlighted DEGs in the ovarian tissues of relatively high and low laying Lingyun black-bone chicken and identified essential candidate genes related to the egg-laying rate, thereby providing a theoretical basis for improving the egg-laying rate of Lingyun black-bone chicken.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Profiling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, RNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcriptome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34323396</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Sentinel serosurveillance of backyard hens proved West Nile virus circulation in the western provinces of Turkey.</Title>	<Abstract>West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of a re-emergence importance with a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Granted, it causes asymptomatic infection, but fatal cases and neurologic disorders were also recorded, especially in humans, horses and some exposed birds. The virus is globally spread and birds are considered an amplifying and reservoir host of WNV, helping to spread the disease due to their close contact with main hosts. In this study, we aimed to detect the presence of antibodies against WNV in backyard hens that were reared in the western Anatolian part of Turkey. A total of 480 chicken sera were randomly collected from six provinces in the west of Turkey (Mugla, Izmir, Aydin, Afyonkarahisar, Kutahya and Manisa) with 80 samples from each province (40 in spring and 40 in fall seasons). They were tested by using a competitive ELISA method to identify the specific avian antibodies of IgG that produced against the WNV envelope proteins (pr-E). Twelve of 480 (2.5%) sera were found seropositive, three of these positive sera were detected from the Izmir province (3.75%) collected in the spring session and the other nine positive sera were detected from the Mugla province (11.25%) collected in the fall session. Both of these provinces are located seaside and have suitable climate conditions for vectors of infection. The results indicated that WNV infection is in circulation in these provinces, and that may put the other susceptible vertebrates under risk of infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Culicidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mosquito Vectors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>West Nile Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>West Nile virus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The questionnaire was distributed, and data collected, from 233 backyard farmers from five selected Oblasts (Rivne, Kharkiv, Odessa, Zakarpattia and Kiev). Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to identify factors that could influence knowledge, and Dunn tests were performed to determine differences between groups when the Kruskal-Wallis tests were significant. Spearman tests were carried out to explore the association between knowledge and risky practices. Results show that comprehensive knowledge on ASF is not common in backyard farmers and that risky practices that influence the spread of ASF are regularly performed. Of the respondents, 47% felt well-informed about how ASF can be transmitted and 31.8% felt confident about recognizing clinical signs of ASF. The independent variable "Oblast" was identified as a significant factor (p = 0.0015) associated with differences in knowledge on clinical signs. We demonstrated statistically significant differences of knowledge between backyard farmers from different Oblasts. Knowledge of preventive measures was positively correlated with risky handling practices related to edible pork products (p = 0.0053) and non-edible pork products (p = 0.0417). In conclusion, our results show that backyard farmers have knowledge gaps on ASF and practice various risky behaviours that might favour the spread of the disease in Ukraine. There are regional differences in ASF knowledge and risky practices that should be taken into consideration in future evidence-based ASF prevention and control programs, including public awareness activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ukraine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>34352158</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison of a human portable blood glucose meter and automated chemistry analyser for measurement of blood glucose concentrations in healthy dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Blood glucose measurement is one of the most commonly performed clinical diagnostic tests used to monitor glycaemia in several animal diseases. Usually, these laboratory analyses are performed on blood venous samples in remote laboratories, and the results are delayed, at best. The use of portable glucometers could evidently solve many constraints but veterinary-use glucometers are not usually available. The present study aimed to compare blood glucose levels obtained by Bionime glucometer to the reference method using glucose oxidase. Venous blood was collected from a total number of 140 healthy dogs (72 males and 68 females), of different breeds (28 German Shepherd, 27 Pitt bull, 21 Boxer, 24 Rottweiler and 40 cross-bred dogs) and different ages (range: 3 months-14 years) for glucose measurement using the reference laboratory method. Capillary blood samples were used to conduct a glucose measurement with a human-use glucometer. Our results revealed that there was no significant difference between the mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) measured with the human-use glucometer (5.06 &#177; 0.84 mmol/L) and the mean venous blood glucose (VBG) measured with the laboratory reference method (4.90 &#177; 0.73 mmol/L) (p = 0.42). Similarly, there was no significant difference of the mean CBG and VBG in male dogs (5.11 &#177; 0.88 and 4.97 &#177; 0.75 mmol/L, respectively) and female dogs (5.01 &#177; 0.81 and 5.07 &#177; 0.72 mmol/L, respectively) (p = 0.73 and 0.21, respectively), and no correlation to neither age (5.43 &#177; 0.90 and 5.20 &#177; 0.70 mmol/L in 3 to 6 month-old dogs, 5.03 &#177; 0.82 and 4.94 &#177; 0.79 mmol/L in 6 months to 1 year-old, 4.94 &#177; 0.67 and 5.13 &#177; 0.66 mmol/L in 1 to 4 year-old dogs; 4.88 &#177; 0.94 and 4.80 &#177; 0.75 mmol/L in dogs older than 4 years, respectively, p &lt; 0.05), nor to breed (4.94 &#177; 1.01 and 4.99 &#177; 0.79 mmol/L in German Shepherd, 5.13 &#177; 0.84 and 4.99 &#177; 0.79 mmol/L in Pitt Bull, 5.07 &#177; 0.94 and 5.07 &#177; 0.77 mmol/L in Boxer, 5.40 &#177; 0.59 and 5.48 &#177; 0.55 mmol/L in Rottweiler and 4.89 &#177; 0.75 and 4.77 &#177; 0.59 mmol/L in cross-bred dogs, respectively, p &lt; 0.05).

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in food handlers in Iran. In the present study, a comprehensive literature search was carried out in electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), Iran Medex and Iran Doc, to identify all the published studies from 2000 to 31st April 2019. A total of 25 articles from different regions of Iran were identified and fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Totally, 140,447 cases were examined and 1163 cases were infected with intestinal parasites. Of all cases, 19,516 were male and 5901 were female with 1163 and 652 infected cases, respectively. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections was evaluated 14.0% [95% CI: 11.0-17.0%]. It is revealed that protozoan, such as Giardia lamblia, with prevalence of 41.0% [95% CI: 25.0-59.0%], Blastosystis hominis with 28.0% [95% CI: 15.0-44.0%] and Entamoeba coli with 22.0% [95% CI: 16.0-29.0%] had the highest prevalence while, Dientamoeba fragilis 5.0% [95% CI: 4.0-7.0%], Iodamoeba b&#252;tschlii 5.0% [95% CI: 2.0-8.0%], Chilomastix mesnili 5.0% [95% CI: 2.0-9.0%] and Endolimax nana with 3.0% [95% CI: 1.0-7.0%], were less prevalent. Infection with Ascaris lumbricoides7.0% [95% CI: 0.0-29.0%] was more prevalent helminth followed with Enterobius vermicularis 3.0% [95% CI: 1.0-5.0%], Hymenolepis nana 2.0% [95% CI: 1.0-3.0%], Taenia spp. 2.0% [95% CI: 0.0-7.0%] and Trichuris trichiura 1.0% [95% CI: 0.0-1.0%]. The high prevalence of commensal parasites, such as Entamoeba coli, which does not need cure is indicating the importance of personal hygiene in food handlers.

<Rec><Common><PMID>34378334</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't</Type>	<Title>The course of African swine fever in Romanian backyard holdings - A case report.</Title>	<Abstract>African swine fever (ASF) was diagnosed for the first time in Romania in a backyard holding in Satu-Mare County in July 2017. Since then, more than 3800 outbreaks occurred in the entire country. Disease control strategies in the backyard sector rely almost exclusively on reactive measures implemented upon appearance of clinical signs and laboratory confirmation of ASF. In our descriptive study, infection course and outbreak investigation data of 56 affected backyard holdings in Satu-Mare County has been investigated. Early disease detection based on clinical signs appeared to be efficient. In the majority of outbreaks, ASF was detected within the first 2 weeks after the estimated virus introduction. A clinical phase of 2-8 days was observed before pigs either succumbed to the disease or control measures were implemented on affected farms. A moderate on-farm transmissibility of ASF virus between pigs was observed. Four clusters of outbreaks were identified indicating virus perpetuation and transmission from farm to farm. To suspend infection chains, rapid intervention by isolating affected farms combined with effective biosecurity measures is required. However, due to the backyard peculiarities, quick and effective implementation of control measures has shown to be rather difficult.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Romania</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twelve adult male dogs were used. Under isoflurane anaesthesia, exsanguination was performed in the target forelimb. Then, a blood pressure cuff was encircled around the limb proximal to the elbow joint with a pressure of approximately 150 mmHg above the mean arterial blood pressure. The animals then received one of the two treatments of lidocaine (3 mg/kg) or ropivacaine (1.5 mg/kg) with a final volume of 0.6 mL/kg into the cephalic vein. After 60 min, the anaesthesia was disrupted and the tourniquet was removed using intermittent opening (30 s) and closing (5 min) manner for three times. The results revealed that at 20 and 30 min after the initiation of IVRA, the dogs in ROP showed higher analgesia than LID. A leakage under the tourniquet during IVRA was detected. Tremor and hypersalivation were observed after tourniquet removal in some dogs. It was concluded that ropivacaine might provide a higher quality of anaesthesia than lidocaine in IVRA in dogs. The development of local anaesthetic toxicity is a major concern and should be considered at the time of tourniquet removal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia, Conduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lidocaine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ropivacaine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The disease can cause severe morbidity and mortality resulting in serious economic losses. Since there is no vaccine available to control ASF, early detection is critical to contain and control the disease. The aim of this study was to develop a novel real-time PCR assay based on highly conserved ASFV gene E183L (p54). The limit of detection of the assay, VNUA-p54 real-time PCR, was 2.63 copies/reaction and 2 Log10 HAD50 /ml. The VNUA-p54 real-time PCR was able to detect fifteen different ASFV reference strains representing p72 genotypes I, II and V. The assay was specific and did not amplify other swine viruses including CSFV, FMDV, PRRSV and PEDV. The diagnostic sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay was evaluated using 200 field clinical specimens collected from swine farms located in different provinces in Vietnam. The VNUA-p54 real-time PCR assay is an additional tool for ASF diagnostics and can be used in combination with other p72 based ASFV real-time PCR assays as a rapid confirmatory assay.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vietnam</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Milk is not only a complete food but also a unique medium for activating various bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi. In recent years, numerous bacteria with multiple drug resistance patterns have appeared, and there have been many problems in infection control. Today, ranchers use antibiotics for control of the animal disease, and humans are constantly using animal products containing antibiotics.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contamination status of raw and pasteurised milk as well as local cheese and to find a rapid Multiplex PCR method for investigation of contamination. Determination of antibiotic resistant isolates is also desirable.</Abstract><Abstract>One hundred samples were collected from livestock and retail outlets using culture and molecular methods to identify S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and S. typhi. The antibiotic resistance pattern was determined for the isolates.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, culture results for 100 samples showed 10% S. aureus isolates while no cases of S. typhi and L. monocytogenes were detected. In real-time qPCR, S.&#160;aureus was isolated in 60% (n&#160;=&#160;60) of samples, S. typhi in 53% (n&#160;=&#160;53) and L. monocytogenes in 2% (n&#160;=&#160;2). The results of sensitivity and specificity of Multiplex PCR for the three studied bacteria indicated general specificity of 72% and sensitivity of 80%.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that S. typhi, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus are more likely to be detected by real-time qPCR because of the high sensitivity of this test to culture.

This prospective study determined the prevalence of faecal IgA deficiency (IgAD) in GSD and investigated several candidate genes and the canine genome for a region or locus co-segregating with IgAD in GSD. Faecal IgA concentrations were quantified and genomic DNA was extracted from 8 GSD with an undetectable faecal IgA (classified as IgAD) and 80 non-IgAD GSD. The canine minimal screening set II microsatellite markers were genotyped, with evidence of an association at p &lt; 1.0 &#215; 10[-3] . Faecal IgA concentrations were also tested for an association with patient clinical and biochemical variables.</Abstract><Abstract>Allele frequencies observed using the candidate gene approach were not associated with faecal IgAD in GSD. In the genome-wide association study (GWAS), the microsatellite marker FH2361 on canine chromosome 33 approached statistical significance for a link with IgAD in GSD (p&#160;=&#160;1.2 &#215; 10[-3]).

However, the prevalence of faecal IgAD in GSD appears to be low (&lt;3%). The relationship between faecal IgAD, EPI and loci close to FH2361 on canine chromosome 33 in GSD warrants further investigation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome-Wide Association Study</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genomics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>IgA Deficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulin A</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In 2017 and 2018, faecal samples were collected from wild muskoxen from three distinct populations (Zackenberg, Kangerlussuaq, and Ivittuut) and from domestic sheep from southwest Greenland. Blood samples were collected from muskoxen from Kangerlussuaq and Ivittuut and from sheep. Faecal samples were tested for specific DNA of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp., and blood samples were tested for antibodies against T. gondii and Erysipelothrix. The estimated prevalence of G. duodenalis was 0% (0/58), 17% (7/41) and 0% (0/55) in muskoxen from Zackenberg, Kangerlussuaq and Ivittuut, respectively, and 37% (16/43) in sheep. The estimated prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 0% (0/58), 2% (1/41), 7% (4/55) in muskoxen from Zackenberg, Kangerlussuaq, Ivittuut, respectively, and 2% (1/43) in sheep. Neither Giardia nor Cryptosporidium were detected in winter samples (0/78). Of the positive samples, Giardia from one muskox sample only was successfully typed as G. duodenalis assemblage A, and Cryptosporidium from two muskoxen was successfully typed as C. parvum, subtype IIdA20G1e. The estimated T. gondii seroprevalence was 2% (1/44) and 0% (0/8) in muskoxen from Kangerlussuaq and Ivittuut, respectively, and 1% (1/155) in sheep. The estimated Erysipelothrix seroprevalence was 2% (1/45) and 13% (1/8) in muskoxen from Kangerlussuaq and Ivittuut, respectively, and 7% (10/150) in sheep.

Additionally, studies in canines have shown that immune tolerance, established following HCT, enabled transplantation of solid organs without the need of lifelong immunosuppression. This progress has been possible due to multiple biological similarities between dog and mankind. In this review, the hurdles that were overcome and the methods that were developed in the dog HCT model which made HCT clinically possible are examined. The results of these studies justify the question whether HCT can be used in the veterinary clinical practice for more wide-spread successful treatment of canine haematologic and non-haematologic disorders and whether it is prudent to do so.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematologic Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organ Transplantation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thus, this study aimed to assess knowledge and perception of the community about potential causes of abortion and case-control study of brucellosis as a cause of abortion in cattle of study districts.</Abstract><Abstract>A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2016 and October 2017 in selected districts of the Jimma zone using a questionnaire survey. Based on the questionnaire survey, we also carried out a case-control study (141 cases and 282 controls) to confirm whether the most frequently mentioned disease (brucellosis) is associated with abortion. The blood samples were collected from both cases and controls cattle groups and then serum was separated. The presence of antibody against Brucella organism in serum was first tested by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and all RBPT positive samples were confirmed using the Complement Fixation Test (CFT).</Abstract><Abstract>From a total of 180 randomly selected respondents, the majority (59.4%) of them attributed abortion to infectious diseases. Based on the questionnaire survey, brucellosis, leptospirosis and listeriosis were identified as the major infectious causes of abortion in the areas. Physical injuries, shortage of feed and toxic substances were observed as less important non-infection causes of abortion in the study areas. This study also identified improper disposal of aborted materials and birth products, use of communal bulls, sharing communal grazing areas and water sources which favour disease transmission. Exposure to Brucella organism was higher among cases (6.4%) than controls (2.8%) with a statistically significant difference (p&#160;=&#160;0.042).</Abstract><Abstract>Brucellosis is the most important infectious cause of cattle abortion in this study. Thus, important to conduct appropriate control methods and increasing public awareness of the zoonotic transmission of brucellosis are suggested.

Hyalomma spp. ticks are the primary vectors and sheep are important CCHF virus (CCHFV)-amplifying hosts. In this study, blood samples and ticks collected in October 2019 from 270 sheep from 15 farms across Tunisia constituted the main research material. Moreover, the sera of the same animals taken at different periods between 2018 and 2019 were also used to obtain comparative results. To investigate the presence of anti-CCHFV antibodies in sheep, all sera were tested using ELISA. Reactive sera were further characterised by a virus neutralisation test (VNT). Overall, one out of the 270 tested sheep was both ELISA- and strongly VNT-positive to CCHFV. Another two sheep were borderline ELISA-positive but did not exhibit neutralising antibodies. Ninety-one ticks were collected from all sampled sheep, of which 34 (37.4%) belonged to Hyalomma spp. This is the first report of anti-CCHFV antibodies in sheep from Tunisia. Both the results of this study and the recent CCHFV detection in ticks collected from camels in southern Tunisia indicate that further studies are needed to determine the competent tick vector in the country and to characterise the epidemiological cycle of CCHFV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Crimean-Congo</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemorrhagic Fever, Crimean</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ixodidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ticks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tunisia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a jejunal mass and a slightly enlarged jejunal lymph node. A fine-needle aspiration of the mass revealed many round cells with multiple small intracytoplasmic magenta granules. The mass was diagnosed as a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) lymphoma based on cytology. The LGL lymphoma was completely resected via open surgery. The histologic and cytologic evaluations showed no neoplastic findings in the jejunal lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney or bone marrow. The LGL lymphoma was localized to the jejunum. Postoperatively, the cat received chemotherapy with nimustine, L-asparaginase and prednisolone. The cat is currently receiving nimustine every 6 weeks, without adverse events, and treatment has been administrated a total of 18 times up until day 552. The cat is in a good condition, and the LGL lymphoma has not recurred.

Common pregnancy rates were estimated by coalescing pregnancy rates of studies performed independently, and heterogeneity between the studies was investigated. The meta-analysis included 24 studies that determined pregnancy rates in 78 different groups consisting of 1934 sheep with five different synchronization protocols in Turkey between 2001 and 2020. Among the different synchronization methods, the P4+PMSG group (90.37%) during the breeding season and P4+PGF2&#945; (69.77%) and P4 (68.75%) groups during the non-breeding season showed the highest pregnancy rate. Also, the effect size of P4+PMSG application during the breeding season was calculated as 0.934 (95% confidence interval: 0.901-0.967), and the effect size of P4+PGF2&#945; application during the non-breeding season was calculated as 0.709 (95% confidence interval: 0.406-1.013). To conclude, the combination of P4+PMSG during the breeding season and progestogen and other hormone applications during the non-breeding season are the most effective methods for estrus synchronization and for achieving the desired pregnancy rates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dinoprost</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus Synchronization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meta-Analysis as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seasons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turkey</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An iButton thermometer was used to measure the body temperatures of three Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadacyla) and three Sunda pangolins (M. javanica). The body temperature of Chinese pangolins was 33.2 &#177; 0.95&#176;C (30.6-34.2&#176;C, n = 3) and that of Sunda pangolins was 32.8 &#177; 0.48&#176;C (31.7-34.2&#176;C, n = 3). The daily variation in body temperature was 1.0-2.9&#176;C in three Chinese pangolins and 1.2-1.9&#176;C in three Sunda pangolins. The body temperature of Sunda pangolins tended to rise at night, with the highest body temperatures occurring mostly at night. This study provides valuable body temperature data for Chinese and Sunda pangolins and lays the foundation for future research on their mechanisms of body temperature regulation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pangolins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design (RCBD), and lambs were blocked based on their initial body weight. The feeding trial was conducted for 90 days followed by 7 days of digestibility trial. Natural pasture hay was treated with molasses solution for improvement of palatability and digestibility and offered for all experimental lambs in ad libitum.</Abstract><Abstract>The crude protein (CP) contents of natural pasture hay (NPH), CSH and NSC were 4.99, 18.31 and 36.5%, respectively. The total DM intakes of lambs (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) increased at higher levels of CSH supplementation. The CP intake decreased with increasing levels of CSH supplementation. Digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was improved by a higher level of CSH supplementation but CP digestibility was not affected by supplementation of CSH. The average daily gain (ADG) showed significant difference (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) among treatments. Similarly, the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was significantly different (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) among treatments; higher FCE was recorded at T1 but lower was at T3 and T4. The hot carcass weight (HCW) showed significant difference (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) among treatments; higher value was observed in T5 (9.36&#160;kg), but the smallest value was recorded for lambs on the T3 (7.36&#160;kg). The higher dressing percentage (DP) on empty body weight basis was recorded in three treatment (T1&#160;=&#160;T4&#160;=&#160;T5) groups compared with (T2&#160;&gt;&#160;T3) treatments. Significantly higher (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) rib-eye area was achieved at a high level of CSH and sole NSC supplemented lambs. The economic feasibility showed that the highest profit was achieved in T5.</Abstract><Abstract>From the present study, it was concluded that CSH could be used for supplementation of protein source feed for body weight gain for Gumuz lambs by replacing high-cost concentrates in a native hay-based basal diet. As a final point, CSH supplementation was recommended as replacement of NSC at 417.98&#160;g CSH (T5) for better biological performance as well as economic value.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethiopia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seeds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vigna</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ten heads of Arabian horse breed were used. The different structures in the nasal, oral and cranial cavities were determined and labelled in the anatomical sections and their corresponding CT scan images. Three paranasal sinuses namely maxillary, conchofrontal and sphenopalatine sinuses were identified in the CT scan images. The caudal maxillary sinus was the largest paranasal sinus with 131.93 &#177; 7.67 cm[3] volume and the sphenopalatine sinus 13.3 &#177; 1.2 cm[3] volume was the smallest one.

The prevalence of antebrachial fractures is 18.0% in dogs and 2.0-8.0% in cats. Many studies focus solely on the trabecular and cortical bone structure of dogs and the characteristics of the cat are often disregarded. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trabecular structure parameters [bone volume fraction per total volume (BV/TV), bone surface per total volume (BS/BV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), connectivity density (Conn. D), degree of anisotropy (DA)] and the diaphyseal cortical bone density (Mean Density) of the antebrachium in cats and small dogs to visualise their differences. For this purpose, a total of 32 forearms of cats (n = 8) and small dogs (n = 8) were evaluated using microcomputed tomography and the findings were compared. The results of the study showed that cats had higher values for BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, DA and Mean Density and lower values for BS/BV, Tb.N and Conn.D at radius and ulna compared to dogs. According to the results of this study, the higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV), thicker trabeculae (Tb.Th), increased anisotropy (DA) and significantly higher diaphyseal cortical density (Mean Density) could contribute to the lower fracture risk of the antebrachium in cats compared to small dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cortical Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radius</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ulna</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>X-Ray Microtomography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although Bangladesh did not experience a BSE outbreak but the country could not export animal products to developed countries as has not yet been declared BSE free country by OIE due to lack of scientific risk evaluation for BSE. The objectives were identification of hazard, release and exposure pathways of pathological prion protein through MBM and analysis of risk for the occurrence of BSE in Bangladesh.</Abstract><Abstract>The scientific data were reviewed, hazards were scheduled and surveys were conducted on livestock production system, import of MBM and its use to identify the hazards present in Bangladesh context. The analysis was done by the 'OIE Risk Analysis Framework 2006 and European Union (EU) Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) 2003'. From the historical reviews, import of MBM and its use was identified, as external hazards.</Abstract><Abstract>The analysis revealed that these hazards had negligible or moderate risk for the introduction of infectious PrP[sc] as Bangladeshi cattle are vegetarian cattle. No milk replacer was used and use of slaughtered waste in the animal feed industry is absent. Unconsumable bones are processed to produce bone chips, fertilizers and bone meal for poultry feeds. Scrapie was never prevalent in Bangladesh. Therefore, risk from the internal challenge was negligible in Bangladesh for the occurrence of classical BSE. These prevented the propagation of BSE infectivity and eliminated BSE infectivity from the system very fast, if that was present.</Abstract><Abstract>It was concluded that introduction of PrP[sc] into cattle population of Bangladesh through MBM was very negligible.

The ELISA antibody titer in sub-chronic infections and the expression analysis of some selected genes (IL-1&#946;, LITAF, TGF-&#946;, HSP90 and HSP70) are used as the clinical signs for acute infections to assess the possible protective role of a commercial immunomodulator (STIMULAN). Five groups were used during the acute experiment: G1-control; G2a-susceptible; G2b-resistant birds, G3-which received STIMULAN and G4-which received the infection + STIMULAN. The groups with sub-chronic infections include G1 (control), G2 (high antibody titer) and G3 (low antibody titer). The gene expressions among the susceptible birds during acute infection of both breeds are nearly similar. They only differ in the expression of HSP90 in the Fayoumi breed. However, the resistant birds vary in their gene expression profile. The effect of STIMULAN as a feed additive in non-infected birds was an up-regulation of LITAF, TGF-&#946;, HSP90 in Fayoumi. Moreover, a powerful stimulatory role was observed when both breeds were infected. Both breeds were asymptomatic during the sub-chronic infection. Although, the increased expression of inflammatory-related genes in the Hy-line was considered as an indication of infection persistence. Fayoumi is capable of immune clearance for this infection. Thus, the Fayoumi breed is more resistant to acute Salmonella infection. HSP90 plays a vital role in its resistance. We recommend the use of STIMULAN as an immunomodulator during Salmonella infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Infections, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella enteritidis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

For this, 300 chicks were divided into four groups. Group one to three received florfenicol, lasalocid and lasalocid plus florfenicol, respectively. Group four as the control group received a basic diet without lasalocid or florfenicol. Lasalocid was used from 7 to 35 days old, continuously. Florfenicol was used at 21 days old for 5 days. The growth indices were measured at the end of each week. The chickens were euthanized at the ages of 28 and 35 days old after collecting blood samples with and without anticoagulants. The liver, heart, muscle, kidney and sciatic nerve were collected in formalin 10% for histopathological examination. The blood and serum samples were used to determine clinical pathologic and hematologic indices. The ratio of internal organs to body weight and ratio of the right ventricle to the total ventricles (RV/TV) of the heart was measured. Results showed, the use of lasalocid decreased feed conversion rate and triglyceride, and increased total protein. Simultaneous administration of lasalocid and florfenicol affected histopathology of the liver and heart and significantly increased creatine phosphokinase, uric acid and the ratio of RV/TV of heart. The eosinophil percentage in the chickens who received florfenicol plus lasalocid was significantly higher than chickens who received florfenicol alone (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that simultaneous administration of the florfenicol and lasalocid induces side-effects especially on cardiac function and it is not recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lasalocid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myocardium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sciatic Nerve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thiamphenicol</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cooperation among medical, veterinary and entomological fields has been promoted by the Italian Public Health Authorities, and an integrated West Nile Virus (WNV) Surveillance Plan has been in force in Italy since 2016 to prevent the transmission risk of WND to humans through an early detection of viral circulation by animal and entomological surveillance. This managing model is unique in Europe.</Abstract><Abstract>This survey aimed at presenting the 'One Health' approach applied in 2016 to the first autochthonous human case of West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease (WNND) in Sicily (Southern Italy).</Abstract><Abstract>Serological (anti-WNV IgM and IgG ELISA, anti-WNV neutralizing antibodies) and molecular tests were conducted on blood, liquor and urine of a 38-year-old man with encephalitis and meningitis. Overall, 2704 adult culicides from 160 mosquito catches were morphologically identified. Female mosquitoes were analysed in pools for WNV RNA detection. Serological (anti-WNV IgM and IgG ELISA) and molecular analyses for WNV were carried out in 11 horses, 271 chickens and two dogs sampled in farms around the man's residence.</Abstract><Abstract>WNND was confirmed by serological analysis on patient's liquor and serum. Collected mosquito species included Culex pipiens (93.56%, CI95% 92.64%-94.49%), Aedes albopictus (5.25%, CI95% 4.41%-6.09%), Culex hortensis (0.59%, CI95% 0.30%-0.88%), Culiseta longiareolata (0.55%, CI95% 0.27%-0.83%) and Anopheles maculipennis s.l.

Because of genetic diversity and sophisticated growth requirements of C. jejuni, several genotyping methods have been investigated to classify this bacterium during the outbreaks. One of such method is to use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).</Abstract><Abstract>The goal of this study was to explore the diversity of C. jejuni isolates with CRISPR from an animal farm.</Abstract><Abstract>Seventy-seven C. jejuni isolates from an animal farm were used in this study. The day-old broilers were reared with other poultry and farm animals, including layer hens, guinea hens, dairy goats and sheep. A small swine herd was also present on an adjacent, but separate plot of land. Isolation and identification of C. jejuni were performed according to the standard procedures. The CRISPR type 1 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA, and the amplicons were sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method. The direct repeats (DRs) and spacers of the CRISPR sequences were identified using the CRISPRFinder.</Abstract><Abstract>The CRISPR sequences were detected in all 77 isolates. One type of DRs was identified in these 77 isolates. The lengths of the CRISPR locus ranged from 100 to 560 nucleotides, whereas the number of spacers ranged from one to eight. The distributions of the numbers of CRISPR spacers from different sources seemed to be random. Overall, 17 out of 77 (22%) C. jejuni isolates had two and five spacers, whereas 14 out of 77 (18%) isolates had three spaces in their genomes. By further analysis of spacer sequences, a total of 266 spacer sequences were identified in 77 C. jejuni isolates. By comparison with known published spacer sequences, we observed that 49 sequences were unique in this study. The CRISPR sequence combination of Nos. 16, 19, 48 and 57 was found among a total of 15 C. jejuni isolates containing various multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) types (ST-50, ST-607, ST-2231 and ST-5602). No. 57 spacer sequence was unique from this study, whereas the other three (Nos. 16, 19 and 48) sequences were found in previous reports. Combination of Nos. 5, 9, 15, 30 and 45 was associated with ST-353. To compare the CRISPR genotyping with other methods, the MLST was selected due to its high discriminatory power to differentiate isolates. Based on calculation of the Simpson's index of diversity, a combination of both methods had higher Simpson's index value than those for CRISPR or MLST, respectively.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results suggest that the MLST from C. jejuni isolates can be discriminated based on the CRISPR unique spacer sequences and the numbers of spacers. In the future, investigation on the CRISPR resolution for C. jejuni identification in outbreaks is needed. A database that integrates both MLST sequences and CRISPR sequences and is searchable is greatly in demand for tracking outbreaks and evolution of this bacterium.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Campylobacter jejuni</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multilocus Sequence Typing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Echocardiography revealed a patent ductus arteriosus. The dog underwent ductus arteriosus closure using an Amplatz Canine Duct Occluder. After the operation, we suspected coagulation and a platelet disorder because of the slightly increased haemorrhage during the operation, postoperative purpura around the surgical wound inside of the thigh, and dog breed, which is known to be commonly affected with von Willebrand disease (vWD). Subsequently, type 1 vWD was confirmed. Complete occlusion was achieved 1 month after the operation; however, 2 months after the operation, recanalization appeared. Recanalization progressed gradually; cardiac redilation was not detected 6 years after the operation. The late recanalization was most likely associated with vWD.

During pregnancy, sow obesity can result in an increase in placental lipid deposition, subsequently inhibiting placental angiogenesis and fetal development. However, the effect of different types of fatty acids on placental angiogenesis is still unclear. Trophoblast cells and vascular endothelial cells constitute two important types of placental tissue. In this study, we used palmitic acid (C16:0) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3), respectively, to treat porcine trophectoderm cells (pTr2) and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC) to study the effects of saturated fatty acids and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on placental angiogenesis in vitro. We found that C16:0 caused significant cytotoxicity in pTr2 and PIEC (p &lt; 0.01) and inhibited the proliferation and migration of PIEC (p &lt; 0.01), whereas C20:5 treatment exhibited very low cytotoxicity and minimal inhibition of cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, a low concentration of C16:0 had no effect on the tube formation in PIEC, whereas C20:5 significantly promoted tube formation of PIEC (p &lt; 0.01). These results suggested that saturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFAs had different effects on placental angiogenesis. As essential functional fatty acid, n-3 PUFA might be effective measure in alleviating the placental lipotoxicity caused by sow obesity during pregnancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eicosapentaenoic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endothelial Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids, Omega-3</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palmitic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placenta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cytology of the nodules revealed sheets of pleomorphic round cells that were morphologically most compatible with histiocytic sarcoma. Histologically, the nodules were fairly demarcated, partially infiltrative, densely cellular neoplasm, and was composed of pleomorphic large round cells arranged in sheets. Special stains for bacteria (Gram stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain) and fungi (periodic acid-Schiff stain) were all negative. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells showed strong cytoplasmic positivity for Iba-1 and CD204, but were negative for CD3 and CD20. Transmission electron microscopy failed to detect Birbeck's granules in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic histiocytes. The chinchilla received chemotherapy with lomustine but died spontaneously on day 62 despite treatment.

Fifteen lambs (3-4 months of age) were randomly allocated into three experimental groups which received different dosages of CS: 0, 20, and 50 mg/kg BW[-1] . The CS was injected on the 1st, 10th[,] and 20th days of the experiment to the lambs through the jugular vein. Assessment of plasma concentration of GH and TH hormones was carried out at days 0 (a day before the start of CS injections), 15, and 30 of the experiment. The antioxidant enzymes were measured at the end of the experiment. Lambs were weighed at days 0, 10, 20, and 30 of the experiment. The results showed that treatment and time affected the BW, GH, triiodothyronine (T3), and tetraiodothyronine (T4) secretion. The intravenous injection of CS increased the BW of growing lambs (p &lt; 0.01) and increased the plasma concentration of GH, T3, and T4 (p &lt; 0.01). The treatment also enhanced glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; p &lt; 0.05) and reduced malondialdehyde concentrations (MDA; p &lt; 0.01). Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level reduced in CS-1 treatment compared to GC and CS-2 treatments (p &lt; 0.01). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were not affected by CS. In conclusion, intravenous injection of CS improved BW, GH, and TH concentrations and antioxidant capacity in growing lambs grazing on mountain pastures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cysteamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Growth Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Hormones</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

One-hundred and fifty chicken meat samples were collected from meat stores in Zahedan, southeast of Iran and screened for contamination with Salmonella spp. using the polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the inv-A gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 11 commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents in the veterinary treatment to calculate the MAR index RESULTS: The contamination rate was 2.7% (4/150). The antimicrobial resistance rate was 100% (n = 4) against penicillin, tylosin, tetracycline, erythromycin and tiamulin, 50% (n = 2) against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, difloxacin and lincomycin/spectinomycin and 25% (n = 1) against flumequine and florfenicol. All isolates were sensitive to fosfomycin. Interestingly, all isolates (n = 4) exhibited different MAR patterns. Furthermore, the MAR index ranged from 0.45 to 0.81 CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the MAR index, which indicated that the isolate originated from a source where antibiotics were used to a great degree and/or in large amounts, the results showed that the chicken meat hosted resistant strains of Salmonella spp. in the study area. Overall, the findings indicated an important public health problem. To reduce this alarming signal, the poultry industry should implement control measures in the study area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The issue of disease transmission can be particularly important for threatened wildlife species, yet such information remains scarce due to logistic constraints and government regulation on animal handlings. The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is one of the globally threatened species challenged with habitat fragmentation and human disturbance. In Nepal, livestock grazing is recognised as one of the major threats to the red panda.</Abstract><Abstract>We aimed to provide the first empirical data on gastro-intestinal parasites for sympatric livestock and red panda from two geographically isolated regions in Nepal.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, we systematically sampled, and examined the faecal of livestock and red panda in two separate protected areas to provide the first empirical data on their gastro-intestinal parasite, including the prevalence, parasite richness and load.</Abstract><Abstract>We documented 11 parasite taxa (7 nematodes, 2 cestodes, 1 trematode and 1 coccidian), of which 8 are shared by both livestock and red panda. Furthermore, parasite prevalence, parasite load and parasite richness were generally higher in the livestock than the red panda.</Abstract><Abstract>The data provided from this systematic survey on parasites of sympatric livestock and red panda in wild raises the concern about the potential role of livestock mediating disease dynamics in the red panda. Our study suggests that cross-transmission of parasites between livestock and red panda are likely, and the livestock may be a competent agent bringing disease to both red panda and human. Therefore, managing human-livestock-wildlife contact to reduce disease risk to all groups should be a key component in conservation planning of protected areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Ailuridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ecosystem</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endangered Species</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nepal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasites</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An annual or biennial plant of the Asteraceae family and English name Milk thistle, a Matte green colour and prickly plant with a standing stem that can be thick, simple, or slightly branched (ramified). Its seeds contain about 70%-80% of the flavonolignans of silymarin and about 20%-30% of polymeric and oxidized polyphenolic compounds (such as tannins). Traditionally, the plant has been used to increase milk secretion, relieve menstrual cramps, lessen depression, decrease gallstones, and jaundice as well as improve functions of the liver, spleen, and kidney. This review reviews studies on the effects of adding milk thistle to quail diet. Consumption (0.5% and 1%) of milk thistle powder in the diet of Japanese quail significantly increased feed intake, body weight, and improved carcass components. Blood constituents including total protein and albumin were improved along with decreased HDL, ALT, and AST. The use of milk thistle levels (0.5% and 1.5%) significantly improved the antioxidant total of plasma. Consumption of silymarin in quail diet increased the number of white blood cells, calcium, vitamin D3, and albumin. Silymarin also decreased the relative weights of bursa of Fabricius and spleen. This review indicates that milk thistle can improve growth performance, feed conversion ratio, and immune system in quail.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Laboratory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coturnix</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Silybum marianum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Silymarin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is associated with the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), and owing to the poor prognosis, treatment is rarely reported. A 4-year-old female Korean domestic shorthair cat was presented with hyporexia, fever, lethargy, severe anaemia and rubricytosis. An FeLV antigen test was positive, but a subsequent polymerase chain reaction test was negative. Serum biochemistry analysis results were normal, except for slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with acute erythroleukaemia, and single high-dose (600 mg/m[2]) cytarabine chemotherapy was administered via constant rate infusion for 12 h a day for 5 days. After the first cytarabine administration, the clinical signs and anaemia improved, though no change was noted to other haematological parameters. The patient died of shock 16 days after the second cytarabine administration; the total survival time after diagnosis was 67 days. Post-mortem cytological evaluation of bone marrow aspiration revealed that the myeloid/erythroid ratio was 0.49, the erythroid progenitor cells were 64% of all nucleated cells and the blast cells were 84% of the non-erythroid cells. Histopathology images indicated that the spleen was diffusely expanded by atypical round cells, possibly erythroid precursors. This is the first case report on the prognosis and effects of high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy for acute feline erythroleukaemia with FeLV infection. Although the clinical signs improved, the treatment was not effective. Further studies on erythroleukaemia chemotherapy protocols are required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cytarabine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia Virus, Feline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Human and canine prostate glands share many functional, anatomical and physiological features. Due to these similarities, canine PCa has been proposed as a model for PCa in men. PCa is typically androgen-dependent at diagnosis in men and for this reason, androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) are important treatments for advanced PCa in men. In contrast, there is some evidence that PCa is diagnosed more commonly in castrate dogs, at which point, limited therapeutic options are available. In men, a major limitation of current ADT is that progression to a lethal and incurable form of PCa, termed castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is common. There is, therefore, an urgent need for a better understanding of the mechanism of PCa initiation and progression to CRPC to enable the development of novel therapeutic approaches. This review focuses on the functional, physiological, endocrine and histopathological similarities and differences in the prostate gland of these species. In particular, we focus on common physiological roles for androgen signalling in the prostate of men and dogs, we review the short- and longer-term effects of castration on PCa incidence and progression in the dog and relate how this knowledge may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms of CRPC in men.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Androgen Antagonists</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In addition, it significantly reduced the need for mandatory systemic or rescue analgesia.</Abstract><Abstract>Ovariectomy is a common surgical procedure in bitches. Analgesia during this procedure is important because intraoperative pain can cause negative effects that prevent patient recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate the analgesic efficacy of lidocaine splash block in video-assisted ovariectomy in dogs. The results showed that splash block improved surgical analgesia during canine laparoscopic ovariectomy. Considering its relative simplicity, low cost, and safety, splash block could be used in daily clinical practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Analgesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lidocaine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These viruses are associated with an immunosuppression syndrome similar to 'Young Pigeon Disease Syndrome' (YPDS). This study reports the identification of a natural co-infection, with severe clinical signs (crop vomiting, watery diarrhoea, anorexia and sudden death) of Pigeon aviadenovirus A and Pigeon circovirus in a breeding pigeon flock in Central Anatolia, Turkey. Both viruses were isolated from pigeons pooled internal organs using primary chicken embryo kidney cell cultures (CEKC) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. Also, both viruses were identified by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing whereas histopathological examination showed degenerated hepatocytes with basophilic intranuclear viral inclusions. As known, both viruses typically have similar transmission characteristics and common clinical manifestations; however, co-infection may exacerbate the disease with devastating outcomes.

This study evaluates goitre in the goats of the Darreh Garm region in the vicinity of the Khorramabad city. Three goats with congenital enlarged thyroid glands were referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Lorestan University with signs of arrhythmia, dyspnea and anorexia. Clinical examination, radiographic and sonographic evaluations were performed. Afterward, a comprehensive visual observation was accomplished in the outbreak region and blood samples were taken for thyroid hormones measurement in does and kids. Moreover, soil and forage samples were collected to assess the iodine concentration and soil parameters. Results indicated that the thyroid hormone concentration in the serum of the affected does and kids were significantly lower than healthy and treated animals. Treatment with sodium thyroxine significantly increased the concentration of T3 and T4 hormones. Pasture (5.28 &#177; 1.57 mg/kg) and soil (11.0 &#177; 1.49 mg/kg) iodine levels were lower than normal levels in this region. Histopathological slides of the thyroid glands from the dead kids indicated thyroid follicles with different sizes and hyperplasia of the glands.

A total of 140 blood samples of camels were randomly collected in four selected cities including Qaen, Nehbandan, Iranshahr, and Zahedan from March to August 2019. Blood smears of each case were also examined by the Giemsa staining method and extracted DNA samples were subjected to internal transcribed spacers (ITS1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The prevalence rates using microscopically and molecular examinations were 10% and 19.28%, respectively. The prevalence rates significantly vary between the selected regions (p = 0.003). PCR technique showed higher sensitivity than microscopy. We found that all infected camels were positive for Babesia caballi. The rate of infection with Babesia among the camel in Zahedan is remarkable. Early diagnosis and early treatment can prevent further spread of the disease in this area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34811966</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>A pilot study on dietary and faecal calcium/phosphorus ratios in different types of captive ruminating herbivores.</Title>	<Abstract>Quantitative differences in calcium and phosphorus metabolism between domestic species exist and can be visualised using data on calcium and phosphorus intake and faecal excretion. The parameter for analysing the results was defined as &#916; = dietary calcium/phosphorus (Ca/P) ratio - faecal Ca/P ratio. In previous studies, hindgut fermenters had significantly higher &#916; values than ruminants (sheep, cattle, goats), which was explained by the high calcium digestibilities in hindgut fermenters in contrast to highly efficient phosphorus recycling in ruminants. The first hypothesis of the present study was that different types of ruminants (grazer, browser, intermediate feeder) would show differences in &#916; as a proxy for quantitative calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The second hypothesis was that camelids as functional, but not taxonomic ruminants would show &#916; values similar to ruminants. We used herbivorous zoo animals (17 species, hindgut and foregut fermenters), which were kept on their regular diet without variation for 1 week. Then, faecal samples were obtained from the individual animals. Feed items and faecal samples were analysed for calcium and phosphorus, and dietary and faecal Ca/P ratios as well as &#916; were calculated. A comparison of the species groups (one-way ANOVA on ranks, p &lt; 0.05) showed that zoo hindgut fermenters had significantly higher &#916; values (0.67 &#177; 0.34) than camelids and zoo ruminants (-1.07 &#177; 0.35 and -1.87 &#177; 1.56). There was no significant difference between camelids, grazers (-1.49 &#177; 1.31), browsers (-1.63 &#177; 0.88) and intermediate feeders (-2.11 &#177; 1.76). The ruminant species from this study had markedly lower &#916; than domestic ruminants from literature data. Especially intermediate feeders had low &#916;, possibly due to more efficient phosphorus recycling than the domestic ruminants.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herbivory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphorus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34812595</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Contribution of the mutation rs8193069 in TLR4 to mastitis resistance and performance in Holstein cows in southern China.</Title>	<Abstract>Bovine mastitis has become increasingly important issues for farmers and consumers, leading to large economic losses in the dairy industry worldwide. Because treatment of mastitis is difficult and costly, improved mastitis resistance through selective breeding would be advantageous. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important player in recognising pathogens and activating immune responses. However, its roles in mastitis occurrence and the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs8193069 (T &#8594; C) in TLR4 gene was detected in a Holstein cow resource population in southern China. Association analysis with 5-year production traits, haematology, and biochemistry parameters revealed that individuals with genotype CC had significantly lower somatic cell counts (SCC), lower fat percentage, but higher 305-day milk (p &lt; 0.05) and total milk yield (p &lt; 0.01). Both genotypes CC and CT had lower lymphocyte counts (#LYMPH) (p &lt; 0.01) and basophil counts (#BASO) (p &lt; 0.05) than TT. Genotype CC had a less level of triglyceride (p &lt; 0.01) and creatine kinase (p &lt; 0.05) than CT. Further analysis based on the production data revealed significant positive correlations between SCC and #LYMPH. Analysis of TLR4 protein structure and properties suggested that the missense mutation on the 674th amino acid from Thr to Ile reduced the flexibility and hydrophilicity of TIR domain, implying a weakened binding ability of TLR4 to its adaptors. In conclusion, allele C of rs8193069 was the major allele in Holstein cows that indicated a greater genetic potential to mastitis resistance and milk yields, probably via the LPS-TLR4 inflammatory signalling. This study offers a marker to improve mastitis resistance in the dairy cow population in southern China.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastitis, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mutation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toll-Like Receptor 4</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A group of 12 mixed breed female dogs, aged 1-2 years, weighing 19.95 &#177; 0.95 kg were included. Forty minutes after sedation with 0.05 mg/kg intramuscular acepromazine 1%, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg/kg). The dogs were connected to the inhalation anaesthesia circuit using isoflurane. Ovariohysterectomy was performed, and before the closure of linea alba, the animals received intraperitoneal morphine (0.5 mg/kg) (in group M) and saline (0.2 ml/kg) (in group S). No significant difference was detected in total protein and glucose levels between the groups, while the cortisol level in group M was significantly lower than group S 1, 3 and 6 h after surgery. Furthermore, the comparison of the rectal temperature, heart rates and respiratory rates showed no major differences. Additionally, no significant alterations were detected between the groups considering the changes in the pain scores with simple descriptive score, Glasgow, University of Melbourne pain scale, sedation status and Sammarco methods. Finally, three cases in group S and two cases in group M were given an intramuscular analgesic rescue dose of morphine. Although a significant decline was observed in cortisol levels following intraperitoneal morphine administration, there were no beneficial changes in the efficiency of post-operative analgesia in status and clinical signs compared to the control group. Further studies are required to investigate intraperitoneal morphine effectiveness in post-operative pain management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Morphine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the transcriptomes in hypothalamic and pituitary tissues from intersex goats have rarely been studied. The aim of this study was to screen candidate genes and signalling pathways related to sex reversal in Huai goats by analyzing gene expression in hypothalamic and pituitary tissues via transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. In total, 612 and 139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the intersex and non-intersex groups in the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. The DEGs in the hypothalamus and pituitary were significantly enriched in 41 and 16 signalling pathways, respectively, including the calcium signalling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signalling pathway, and oestrogen signalling pathway, which might be related to intersex sex development disorders. A candidate gene from the tachykinin family (TACR1) was significantly enriched in the calcium signalling pathway. Thirty-one DEGs were shared between these two comparisons and were enriched in several acetyl-CoA-related processes and the oestrogen signalling pathway. The results of the real-time PCR analysis show that the transcriptome sequencing results were reliable. The transcriptome data indicate that the regulation of various physiological systems is involved in intersex goat development. Therefore, these results provide helpful data enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying intersex syndrome in goats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disorders of Sex Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Profiling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypothalamus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA-Seq</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcriptome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The optimal therapeutic dose to be confirmed in the field studies was established using a combination of pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. First, a PK study was performed to determine the plasmatic profile of enflicoxib and its active pyrazol metabolite in dogs. Thereafter, two studies using a urate crystal-induced acute arthritis model allowed to correlate efficacy with plasmatic concentrations. Finally, a population PK model was developed to establish the Minimum Effective Concentration (MEC) and the Maximum Tolerated Concentration (MTC). Enflicoxib plasma concentrations were highest for the first 48 h. Thereafter, pyrazol metabolite concentrations were higher and persisted up to the end of the study. No reduction on the lameness (CLS) or pain scores (PS) was observed in the first hours after enflicoxib administration so no MEC could be established for the parent compound. Both CLS and PS were greatly reduced when the pyrazol metabolite achieved concentrations of 411 ng/ml or higher, so this concentration was established as the MEC for the pyrazol metabolite. Enflicoxib MTC was established at 6723 ng/ml whereas for the pyrazol metabolite it was 4258 ng/ml. The population PK model showed that a loading enflicoxib dose of 8 mg/kg followed by weekly maintenance doses of 4 mg/kg would achieve stable concentrations of the pyrazol metabolite within the therapeutic window (between the MEC and the MTC), and it was considered the most adequate posology to be confirmed in the field clinical studies for the treatment of canine osteoarthritis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pharmaceutical Preparations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyrazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sulfonamides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An 11-year retrospective study in Tokachi district, Hokkaido, Japan.</Title>	<Abstract>Salmonella enterica in cattle has long been problematic and suspected to be transmitted by wildlife in Tokachi, Hokkaido, a major cattle farming area in Japan. Understanding the role of wildlife in S. enterica transmission would be helpful for developing control strategies of bovine salmonellosis.</Abstract><Abstract>We aimed to elucidate the possibility of S. enterica transmission between sympatric wildlife, including raccoons and crows and cattle, in Tokachi from 2008 to 2018 by analysing S. enterica detection records, and the genetic relatedness of serotypes shared between wildlife and cattle.</Abstract><Abstract>S. enterica detection records were based on the results of a field survey and existing cattle records at relevant organisations, including clinical reports, a monitoring survey and quarantine for introduced calves at growing farms and public calving farms. S. enterica was identified by polymerase chain reaction assay and serotyped by agglutination assay. The detection records were organised chronologically to investigate whether common serotypes in wildlife and cattle were detected in the same year. The isolates corresponding to detection records were assessed for their genetic patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.</Abstract><Abstract>The prevalence of S. enterica in raccoons and crows was 10.7% (17/159) and 5.7% (55/967), respectively. The following serotypes were detected from both wildlife and cattle: Braenderup, Dublin, Infantis, Mbandaka, Montevideo, 4,[5],12:i:- and Typhimurium. Genetically similar isolates for S. Braenderup, S. Dublin, S. Montevideo and S. 4,[5],12:i:- were detected from both species in the same year.</Abstract><Abstract>Our long-term retrospective observations supported that S. enterica was shared between wildlife and cattle. Wildlife invasions should be controlled at farms to prevent inter-species transmission of S. enterica from livestock farms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Agriculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Infections, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella enterica</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cats and minks are continuing to be the most reported species with SARS-CoV-2 infections among animals but it needs to be investigated further.</Abstract><Abstract>We report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a domestic cat that exhibited respiratory disease after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus from humans in the same household. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in two oropharyngeal swabs collected at two time points, 11 days apart; the first, when the cat was reported to be sick and the second, before euthanasia due to poor prognosis. The viral nucleic acid detected at two time points showed no genomic variation and resembled the clade GH circulating in humans in the United States. Clinical and pathological findings noted in this 16-year-old cat were consistent with respiratory and cardiac insufficiency.</Abstract><Abstract>SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was likely an incidental clinical finding, as the virus was not detected in&#160;fixed lungs, heart, or kidney tissues.

A convenience sampling technique was performed for the selection of these dairy farms and calf samples. A total of 68 faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of diarrhoeic calves. The faecal samples were confirmed as E.&#160;coli O157: H7 positive using the latex agglutination test.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, 47(69.1%) samples were positive for E. coli, of which 22 (46.8%) were identified as E.&#160;coli O157:H7 strains based on their latex agglutination character. Factors such as frequency of calf house cleaning, type of supplement provided, and method of colostrum feeding were significantly correlated (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) with calf diarrhoea, while the other risk factors had no significant association. Antibiogram of E.&#160;coli O157:H7 isolates showed that the isolates were highly sensitive to gentamycin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin and were found to be resistant to tetracycline, kanamycin and amoxicillin.</Abstract><Abstract>Our findings revealed that calf diarrhoea is still a major health problem of calves in the study area.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism whereby ACT inhibits PCV2 infection-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. We observed that in PCV2 infection+ACT treated PK-15 cells, proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly reduced, compared to the PCV2-infected cells. The transfection and luciferase reporter assay confirmed that ACT suppressed NF-&#954;B signalling pathway activation following PCV2 infection in PK-15 cells. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that ACT suppressed the NF-&#954;B signal pathway in PCV2 infection-stimulated PK-15 cells by inhibiting the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and I&#954;B&#945; phosphorylation. BALB/c mice were used as a model to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of ACT in vivo. We found that the BALB/c mice inoculated with PCV2 infection + ACT treated showed a significant reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production in serum, lung and spleen tissue, compared to the PCV2-infected mice. Western blotting confirmed that ACT suppressed the NF-&#954;B signal pathway in PCV2-infected mice by inhibiting the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and I&#954;B&#945; phosphorylation in lung tissue. Our studies first demonstrate that ACT inhibits PCV2 infection-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B in vitro and in vivo.

Typical complications caused by entrapment of air in the wound during locomotion are subcutaneous emphysema, with consecutive pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. In this case report, the clinical, radiographic and laboratory diagnosis and management of these complications after an axillary laceration that finally resulted in pneumoperitoneum are described. A 1-year-old Hannoveranian was presented with a pre-existing axillary laceration of unknown duration and subcutaneous emphysema in the surrounding tissue. Due to extensive tissue loss, attempts to adequately close the wound surgically and by packing with sterile dressing material were unsuccessful. Despite stall confinement and tying of the horse, subcutaneous emphysema was progressive and pneumomediastinum as well as pneumothorax was developed. These complications were monitored radiographically. On day 5 after admission, signs of air accumulation were detected on radiographs craniodorsally in the peritoneum and a pneumoperitoneum was diagnosed. Repeated thoracentesis with a teat cannula to gradually evacuate the thoracic cavity was used in combination with nasal oxygen insufflation to treat global respiratory insufficiency. Subcutaneous emphysema and all other complications resolved progressively and the horse was discharged from the hospital 21 days after admission when the axillary wound was adequately filled with granulation tissue. The wound healed fully 1 month later and the horse did not develop long-term complications within the following year. To the authors&#180; knowledge, the development of pneumoperitoneum including its radiographic monitoring following an axillary laceration has not been described in horses previously.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insufflation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lacerations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Emphysema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumoperitoneum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumothorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Subcutaneous Emphysema</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Reproductive activity in sheep is characterized by a seasonality influenced by several factors such as photoperiod, latitude, temperature, nutrition and breed. Reproductive seasonality and nutritional condition are the main factors that influence embryo production in sheep.

HS caused intestinal dysfunction and disrupted the gut microbiota. However, the researches about the effects of HS on ileal microbiome of indigenous broilers are limited. Therefore, this experiment used 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse the ileal microbial community in indigenous yellow-feather broilers under HS.</Abstract><Abstract>The single factor completely random design was used in the present study, and forty 8-week-old Chinese indigenous yellow-feather broilers (Huaixiang chickens) were randomly divided into two treatments: normal temperature (NT) group and HS group. There are five replications with four broilers per replicate in each group. The broilers in NT group were raised at 21.3 &#177; 1.2&#176;C during the whole experimental period, the broilers in HS group were exposed to 32.5 &#177; 1.4&#176;C for 8 h/day from 9:00 am to 17:00 pm and the temperature of rest time is consistent with NT group.

At the genus level, HS significantly reduced the relative abundance of Campylobacter (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05), and increased the abundance of Delftia (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05). In addition, prediction of microbial community function indicated that HS significantly enhanced the abundance of the microflora related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism and reduced the abundance of the microflora related to nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism.</Abstract><Abstract>Taken together, the present study revealed that chronic HS (4&#160;weeks) exposure changes the abundance of the ileal microflora of broilers.

However, there are few reports of listeriosis associated with L. innocua, which is genetically closely related to L. monocytogenes, but considered non-pathogenic. In this work, we report two cases of suppurative meningoencephalitis in apparently previously healthy ruminants from different farms, in which two strains of L. innocua were recovered. The whole genomes from both isolates were sequenced, allowing phylogenetic analyses to be performed, which indicated that the two strains were very closely related. Virulence determinants were searched, especially genes coding for the main L. monocytogenes virulence factors which have been previously described in L. innocua. Surprisingly, the two isolates do not possess such virulence determinants. Instead, both strains carried a set of genes that encode for other virulence factors of the genus Listeria detected using the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB): iap (division and invasion of host cells), lpeA (entry into non-professional phagocytes cells), fbpA (multifunctional virulence factor, including adherence to host cells), lspA (surface protein anchoring), lap (adhesion to enterocytes and trans epithelial translocation), pdgA (resistance to lysozyme), oatA (resistance to different antimicrobial compounds and also required for growth inside macrophages), lplA1 (use of host-metabolites for in vivo growth), gtcA (catalyses teichoic acid of bacterial wall), prsA2 (cell invasion, vacuole lysis and intracellular growth), clpC, clpE and clpP (survival under several stress conditions). These genes among others detected, could be involved in the ability of L. innocua to produce damage in animal and human hosts. These results highlight the multifactorial profile of Listeria pathogenesis and the need for comprehensive scientific research that address microbiological, environmental and veterinary aspects of listeriosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Listeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Listeriosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ruminants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

LC has been reported in human leukaemia patients, but it is extremely rare in dogs. A 13-year-old spayed female Golden Retriever that was previously diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was managed with chlorambucil (20 mg/m[2] orally, every 2 weeks) and prednisolone (2 mg/kg orally, every other day) for 8 months; however, immunosuppression was temporarily discontinued because of a bacterial urinary tract infection. Cutaneous signs, including multifocal ecchymosis and white plaques, appeared 1 month after cessation of chemotherapy. Histopathological examination revealed small- to intermediate-sized lymphocytes with mild atypia in a perivascular to interstitial pattern within the superficial dermis. The bands of atypical cells within the superficial dermis were strongly and extensively positive for CD3 on immunohistochemistry. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the biopsied skin revealed clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma locus gene. Given the evidence of clinical signs, peripheral immunophenotyping, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonal gene arrangement, LC was diagnosed. The lesions disappeared when chemotherapy was restarted but were occasionally observed when chemotherapy was stopped. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first case report of LC in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemic Infiltration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>T-Lymphocytes</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

One grey wolf in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province showed signs of rabies. Clinical signs were characterised by increased sensitivity, ferocity, restlessness, and depression is accompanied by lethargy. After a while, the animal died. The brain samples were taken from the wolf soon after death. The sample was refrigerated and transported fresh on ice to the laboratory. Fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) confirmed rabies infection in the wolf. Prevention and control of this fatal disease require a sensitive surveillance system to follow suspected animal and human rabies cases thoroughly through the improved reporting system, which contains the history of exposure, clinical examinations, symptoms, and laboratory results.

Ten dogs developed metastatic disease with the most common metastatic site being the lungs (6/10 dogs), with a median time to metastasis of 93 days. Ten dogs were euthanised due to locoregional or distant progression of their mixed thyroid neoplasm. The overall median survival time was 156 days (95%CI: 49-244). The median survival time for dogs treated with adjuvant therapy was 189 days (95%CI: 24-244), whereas dogs without adjuvant therapy had a median survival time of 156 days (95%CI: 35-upper limit could not be calculated; p&#160;=&#160;0.62).</Abstract><Abstract>The thyroid tumours with both mesenchymal and epithelial components in this small sample set were associated with a poor prognosis after surgical excision with or without adjunctive therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroidectomy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Enlargement of the pre-scapular lymph node was the only clinical finding during ante-mortem inspection of the bull. The gross pathological lesion showed a pre-scapular lymph node with a caseo-necrotic dystrophic calcification that was accompanied by a rough texture and white to grayish hue. Histopathologically, the lymph node was characterized by central liquefactive necrosis that was surrounded by coagulative necrosis containing multiple foci of mineralization, infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear immature fibrosis containing inflammatory cells and also with some sort of a thick layer of mature fibrosis that defines the magnitude of the lesion. Cytologically, multi-lobulated (intact and degenerated) neutrophils, a few reactive lymphocytes, macrophages and some crenated histocytes have been recognized. The bacterial culture of the sample revealed small, white cream, dry, waxy colonies with a narrow area of &#946;-haemolysis. The isolate of the sample was a Gram-positive cocci-bacilli that was arranged in a Chinese pattern on Gram staining, and catalase and urease were positive in the biochemical analysis of this organism, which was able to ferment glucose and maltose but not trehalose and xylose.</Abstract><Abstract>The present investigation indicated that CLA was prevalent as sporadic cases among cattle slaughtered in Bishoftu municipal abattoir.

Statistical analysis was performed to compare canine melanocytomas and melanomas.</Abstract><Abstract>The 32 uveal neoplasms were classified as melanocytomas (19/27 in dogs) or melanomas (8/27 in dogs, 5/5 in cats). Most tumours (84%) were located in the anterior uvea. Neoplastic cells were classified as epithelioid, spindle-shaped, mixed, or special type (balloon and signet ring cells). The percentage of cells with melanin, melanin concentration within cells, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, mitotic count, lymphocytic inflammation, necrosis, vascular invasion, and glaucoma were also characterized. Anisocytosis, percentage of neoplastic cells with melanin, mitotic count, and indices (proliferation and apoptotic) varied significantly between canine uveal melanomas and melanocytomas; in general, melanomas had greater cell variability, were less pigmented, and had a higher mitotic count. The melanocytic origin of the neoplasms was confirmed by positive anti-PNL2 immunolabelling (29/32) and positive anti-Melan-A immunolabelling (3/32). In canine uveal melanomas, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis correlated with less pigmentation and minimal pigmentation correlated with a high percentage of immunolabelling for caspase-3.</Abstract><Abstract>Uveal melanocytomas were more common in dogs, and uveal melanomas were more frequent in cats.

The results showed that the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis based on parallel interpretation of the test results was 12.22% (Positive/Tested&#160;=&#160;22/180). The prevalence of acute and chronic brucellosis was 8.3 and 3.9%, respectively. The seroprevalence of brucellosis with RBPT and i-ELISA methods was 1.11% (2/180) and 7.22% (13/180), respectively. According to what SAT revealed, 9.44% (17/180) of sera had a titer of 40 or greater, and at 2-ME, 7.22% of samples (13 out of 180 samples) depicted a titer of 40. The results of i-ELISA, SAT and 2-ME were significantly different from those of RBPT (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01); however, there was no significant difference between i-ELISA, SAT and 2-ME in findings (p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.05).</Abstract><Abstract>The results of this study recommend that i-ELISA be used for screening purposes of brucellosis in horses.

The dog was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 1 month before and was treated with levothyroxine. Severe anaemia with spherocytes, positive saline agglutination test, and hyperbilirubinemia indicated immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA). Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and danazol was started. Although the IMHA was well controlled, during tapering of prednisolone, acute multiple joint swelling and oedema suspected immune-mediated polyarthritis occurred twice. First, clinical symptoms improved as the dosage of prednisolone increased. However, the dog showed severe adverse effects to the steroid. Second time, we added leflunomide as another immunosuppressant, and clinical signs of arthritis disappeared. About 3 weeks later, despite the immunosuppressive therapy, skin lesions resembling an autoimmune dermatologic disorder spread throughout the body. Addition of cyclosporine resolved the skin lesions.

Molecular characterisation is important to verify its taxonomic status in the different parts of the world. In this study, we provide information on the molecular characterisation of R. sanguineus tick of dogs collected from Nigeria. Ticks were collected from 62 of 93 sampled dogs. The collected ticks were subjected to morphological identification with the aid of appropriate entomological keys. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the most prevalent tick species (R. sanguineus) and was subjected to further molecular characterisation protocols. The partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene sequences (&#8764;300 bp) were obtained from representative specimens. Data were statistically analysed using the chi-square (&#967;[2]) test. Phylogenetic analysis was performed including different lineages of R. sanguineus (sl) from Africa, Asia, Europe and America, and other species belonging to the R. sanguineus 'tropical lineage' (R. linnaei) as well as Rhipicephalus turanicus and Ixodes ricinus. Results of this study showed that R. sanguineus was the most abundant ticks of dogs with a prevalence of 61.8% (68/110; 95% CI = 52.5-70.54), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (20.0%) and Haemaphysalis leachi (18.2%). The molecular analysis shows that they are genetically different from the temperate strains but closely related to those from other West African countries. There is a need to establish the vector competence of this common Nigerian dog tick.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nigeria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this study is to isolate, characterize and molecularly identify the bacterium A. paragallinarum in poultry birds, as well as to determine its antibiotic sensitivity and resistance.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 10 chickens from four different Iranian farms with typical IC symptoms were used in this study. The nasal swabs were streaked onto chocolate agar plates and blood agar plates and incubated at 37&#176;C in 5% CO2 for 24 to 48&#160;h. As part of the identification of bacteria, bacteriological observations and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are conducted. The antibiotic sensitivity tests were also performed using the disk diffusion method against A. paragallinarum and the prevalence in different farms was determined.</Abstract><Abstract>By using biochemical assays and PCR analyses, seven strains of A. paragallinarum were isolated from samples of four chicken farms with typical IC clinical signs. Most isolates (4/7) showed the typical requirement for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and an enriched CO2 atmosphere for growth. Three of the seven strains of A. paragallinarum were found to be novel NAD-independent under anaerobic conditions. There was one biochemical biovar identified in terms of carbohydrate fermentation patterns, although changes in maltose carbohydrate fermentation patterns were detected in the No. 5 strain. All isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and spectinomycin. Three novel NAD-independent strains (Nos.1, 5 and 7) were found to be multidrug-resistant (MDR) and resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. There was greater antibiotic resistance in the three NAD-independent isolates than in normal NAD-dependent bacteria.</Abstract><Abstract>By discovering NAD-independent forms of A. paragallinarum, these species have a greater range than previously believed.

The antineoplastic phospholipid compound 2-aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate (2-AEH2F) is an alkyl phosphate ester capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell death by modifying the asymmetry of phospholipids in the cytoplasmic membrane OBJECTIVES: This clinical study was designed to investigate local antitumoural effects of neoadjuvant therapy with 2-AEH2F in dogs with naturally occurring STS MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dogs (n = 11) received four consecutive weekly intravenous injections of 2-AEH2F (70 mg/kg) prior to tumour resection. Tomographic (CT) and thermal (TE) images were used to investigate changes in tumour size and local temperature in response to treatment RESULTS: Comparative analysis of CT images (n = 9/11) failed to reveal complete or partial remission according to selected assessment criteria (RECIST, WHO and volumetric). Comparative analysis of TE images (n = 10/11) revealed significantly (p = 0.01416) lower temperatures in tumoural areas relative to surrounding tissues over the course of treatment CONCLUSIONS: 2-AEH2F had no cytoreductive effects when used at doses and intervals described in this study.

In Kerala, a state in South India, incidences of ND in commercial and backyard poultry have been reported. But a systematic statewide study on the prevalence of the disease has not been carried out.</Abstract><Abstract>A cross-sectional survey was performed to detect the presence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in suspect cases and among apparently healthy commercial flocks and backyard poultry, in the state and to identify risk factors for NDV infection.</Abstract><Abstract>Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the M gene of NDV in choanal swabs and tissue samples collected from live and dead birds, respectively and the results were statistically analysed.</Abstract><Abstract>The predominant clinical signs of the examined birds included mild respiratory signs, huddling together and greenish diarrhoea. Nervous signs in the form of torticollis were noticed in birds in some of the affected flocks. On necropsy, many birds had haemorrhages in the proventriculus and caecal tonsils which were suggestive of ND. Of the 2079 samples tested, 167 (8.0%) were positive for the NDV M-gene by RT-PCR. Among 893 samples collected from diseased flocks, 129 (14.5%), were positive for M gene with pairwise relative risk (RR) of 15.6 as compared to apparently healthy flocks where 6 out of 650 (0.9%) samples were positive. All positive samples were from poultry; none of the ducks, pigeons, turkey and wild birds were positive. Commercial broilers were at higher risk of infection than commercial layers (RR: 4.5) and backyard poultry (RR: 4.9). Similarly, birds reared under intensive housing conditions were at a higher risk of being infected as compared to those reared under semi-intensive (RR: 6.7) or backyard housing (RR: 2.1). Multivariable analysis indicated that significantly higher risk of infection exists during migratory season and during ND outbreaks occurring nearby. Further, lower risk was observed with flock vaccination and backyard or semi-intensive housing when compared to intensive housing. When the M gene positive samples were tested by RT-PCR to determine whether the detected NDV were mesogenic/velogenic, 7 (4.2%) were positive.</Abstract><Abstract>In Kerala, NDV is endemic in poultry with birds reared commercially under intensive rearing systems being affected the most. The outcome of this study also provides a link between epidemiologic knowledge and the development of successful disease control measures. Statistical analysis suggests that wild bird migration season and presence of migratory birds influences the prevalence of the virus in the State. Further studies are needed to genotype and sub-genotype the detected viruses and to generate baseline data on the prevalence of NDV strains, design better detection strategies, and determine patterns of NDV transmission across domestic poultry and wild bird populations in Kerala.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Housing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This is a problem that plagues the poultry industry because it occurs whether birds are reared in the cage or on the floor. It is reported that feeding phytase to floor-reared broiler chicks could ameliorate footpad lesions, which is related to the reduction of litter moisture. However, some studies reported that phytase supplementation could ameliorate footpad lesions, but did not affect litter quality. Therefore, phytase supplementation may have other potential mechanisms to improve the footpad lesions. Cage-reared broiler chicks were used in this study because they had no access to litter.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 234 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to three groups based on the initial body weight (42.22 &#177; 0.18&#160;g) with six replicate cages and 13 birds (mixed sex) per cage. The experimental period was 45 days. Dietary treatments were based on a corn-soybean meal-basal diet and supplemented with 500 and 750 FTU/kg Saccharomyces pombe expressed phytase. The unit of phytase (FTU) was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the release of one micromole phosphate from phytate per minute at 37&#176;C and pH 5.5.</Abstract><Abstract>We found that dietary supplementation of S. pombe expressed phytase could improve calcium and phosphorus digestibility and subsequent improvement in toe ash, thus ameliorating footpad lesions in broiler chicks with no access to litter.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>6-Phytase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Saccharomyces</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These goats were selected based on some inclusion criteria through the period of July 2017 to June 2018. Samples were examined microscopically (Giemsa staining method) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing to identify of Anaplasma spp.</Abstract><Abstract>The overall prevalences were estimated 5.75% (23/400) and 15.75% (63/400) by microscopy and PCR, respectively. Anaplasma ovis (A. ovis) and Anaplasma marginale (A. marginale) were identified with the prevalence of 14.75% (59/400) and 1.0% (4/400), respectively through PCR. Among different risk factors, jamnapari breed (p = 0.027), no use of acaricide (p = 0.025) and presence of tick (p &lt; 0.01) were found to be significantly associated with anaplasmosis.

Ultrasound examination showed a thickened urinary bladder wall and the renal pelvis of right kidney was dilated and cystic. A presumptive diagnosis of renal failure was made, and the tigress was euthanised due to deteriorating quality of life and pronounced weight loss. Histopathology revealed extensive erosion of the urinary bladder wall and marked congestion of the submucosal vasculature, a potential cause of the haematuria observed clinically. Numerous foci of neoplastic cells were also observed throughout the lung parenchyma as well as within lymphatic vessels of the lung, the liver and the kidney. A diagnosis of a metastatic non-papillary high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the urinary bladder was made. Consistent with this diagnosis, immunohistochemistry revealed the neoplastic cells were negative for uroplakin III, as has been reported for a subset of high-grade, infiltrative urinary bladder UCs of canines and humans.

However, many historical reports of fractionated protocols lack time to fracture and fracture rates.</Abstract><Abstract>The primary objectives of this retrospective study were to determine fracture rate and time to fracture of dogs receiving RT (coarse or fine fractionated) for appendicular OS. Secondary objectives were to evaluate tolerability and disease outcome measures.</Abstract><Abstract>Fifty-one dogs that received RT as part of treatment for appendicular OS were available for evaluation. Forty-five received coarse fractionation (C-RT, 8 or 6&#160;Gy per fraction protocols [C-RT8 or C-RT6]) while the remaining six received fine fractionation (F-RT).</Abstract><Abstract>The overall pathologic fracture rate was 37%. Pathologic fracture rate was significantly higher for dogs that received F-RT (5/6, 83%) compared to dogs that received C-RT (12/40, 30%, p&#160;=&#160;0.021). In the 17 dogs that fractured, the overall median time to fracture was 57 days.

The review also sheds light on nutritional and management interventions that help overcome the challenges raised at high altitude. Reduced concentration of atmospheric oxygen is by far the biggest challenge that remarkably affect growth performance and livability of broiler chickens reared in high altitude area. Broiler chickens have endured intensive genetic selection, which potentially predispose them to several metabolic disorders. Hypoxia is an overriding factor that may increase the incidence of metabolic disorders, mainly ascites syndrome at high altitude. Commercial broiler strains cannot fully achieve their genetic potential when raising at highland regions. Careful nutrition and management considerations are required to prevent metabolic disorders when raising broilers at high altitude. In ovo or in-feed nutraceuticals such as l-carnitine and guanidinoacetic acid as well as pharmaceuticals, texture of feed and the use of proper sources and levels of dietary energy and protein are important factors that need to be carefully considered for rearing broiler chickens at high altitude. Management strategies such as lighting programs have been shown to be effective to circumvent ascites prevalence. Special breeding programs may also be considered to develop strains with resistance to ascites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Altitude</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Here, a method of superovulation and estrus synchronisation was used to treat female Duolang sheep. After treatment, there were significant differences in serum FSH and LH levels and the number of dominant follicles between the two groups of sheep. We identified a total of 5021 differentially expressed genes (11, 13 and 15 days after treatment) and performed RT-qPCR analysis to identify several mRNA expression levels. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were involved in the regulation of signalling pathways of follicular development, cell cycle, material synthesis, energy metabolism, such as COL3A1, RPS8, ACTA2, RPL7 RPS6 and TNFAIP6 may play a key role in regulating the development of follicles. Our results show a comprehensive expression profile after superovulation and estrus synchronisation treatment. We provide the basis for further research on breeding techniques to improve the ovulation rate and birth rate of livestock.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus Synchronization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follicle Stimulating Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Superovulation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study aimed to understand perceptions, attitudes and practices (PAP) regarding canine zoonotic helminthiases (CZH) among dog owners in Rwanda.</Abstract><Abstract>A cross-sectional study was carried out in Nyagatare district of Rwanda, where 203 dog owners were randomly selected and interviewed. To analyse this study's data, we used frequency distributions, chi-square test of association and binary logistic regression model.</Abstract><Abstract>Overall, 75.9% and 30% of the respondents were aware of canine and human helminthiases, respectively. Around 74.4% knew that dogs source helminthiases from eating raw infected meat. Also, 74.4% knew vomiting, diarrhoea and swelling of the belly as clinical signs of the helminthiases. Around 58.6% washed hands with soap and water after handling a dog.&#160;Only 17.2% and 15.5% dewormed the dogs and treated them against ectoparasites using conventional anthelmintics and acaricides manufactured for dogs, respectively.&#160;Of all respondents, 33% held genuine perceptions, while 78.3% and 25.1% adopted positive attitudes and appropriate practices about CZH, respectively. The respondents' educational level and length of dog ownership correlated with their perceptions and practices about CZH, respectively, while sources of information on CZH influenced their PAP of such infections. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of having genuine perceptions and positive attitudes were more than 82% lower among those who sourced the information from neighbours &amp; colleagues compared to those who gathered it through reading. Again, the length of dog ownership (OR&#160;=&#160;0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.90) correlated with the respondent's practices about CZH.</Abstract><Abstract>Only 33% and 25.1% of the respondents held genuine perceptions and adopted positive attitudes regarding CZH, respectively.

The improvement of this percentage is challenging as the food is thrown into the fish tank, there is no quantification of the amount of food that is consumed by the fish. In consequence, it is difficult to adjust the food composition making it more nutritive or promoting food consumption by fish. In this study, to investigate food consumption, bio-distribution and food residues, leucine containing [15] N (a stable isotope of nitrogen) was used to label the fish food. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) weighing 100-120 g were maintained in 30 L tanks at a density of 14 kg/m[3] . Fishes were fed daily at 1% of the fish weight with pellet labelled with [15] N-leucine. The [15] N incorporation was determined 14 hours after the feeding in all the fish organs. Results showed that 14 hours after the administration of a single dose of labelled food to Atlantic salmon enables the detection of the tracer in the whole organism allowing determining the food consumption. Through the analysis of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), we showed that the trunk, pyloric caeca and head incorporate the highest level of the marker (72.7, 8.7 and 5.7%, respectively). This methodology would permit monitoring feeding to minimize food loss, improve administration methodologies or select the preferred foods for the fish, among others to reduce production costs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aquaculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leucine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nitrogen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmo salar</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Retrograde intubation via the cricothyroid membrane was planned since direct visualisation of the larynx was not possible. In dorsal recumbency, the cricothyroid membrane was punctured with an 18-gauge needle, and a J-tip guidewire, inserted via the needle, was advanced and identified at the mouth. A 6-Fr truncated feeding tube was inserted from the mouth to the cricothyroid membrane along the guidewire. The guidewire was removed, and the tip of the feeding tube was advanced as an anterograde guide to the inner trachea. Subsequently, an endotracheal tube was inserted along the feeding tube. Capnography was used to confirm correct intubation. Condylectomy was performed on the left temporomandibular joint, and the patient recovered from anaesthesia uneventfully. Retrograde intubation is less invasive than tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy, and the cricothyroid membrane has been suggested as a suitable site for guidewire insertion in humans and dogs. However, when resistance is encountered during the advancement of endotracheal tube using the traditional technique without the anterograde guide, it may be difficult to distinguish where the resistance occurred leading to damage or oesophageal displacement in cats with relatively fragile airway. This report suggests that retrograde intubation via the cricothyroid membrane can be performed in cats with limited visualisation of the larynx, and an anterograde guide following the retrograde wire could reduce the potential damage or oesophageal displacement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ankylosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intubation, Intratracheal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temporomandibular Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temporomandibular Joint Disorders</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This subspecies has the lowest genetic variability and it is in regression. It belongs to Phasianidae family; therefore, the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) could be a good model for developing reproductive technologies for use in capercaillie populations with low availability of animals.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, we analyzed the response of capercaillie sperm to the freezing-thawing process for contributing to the development of a semen cryobank of Cantabrian capercaillie.</Abstract><Abstract>We used domestic chicken as the animal model in order to obtain the freezing protocol before applying on capercaillie. In the first experiment, two different extenders (EK and LR84) and different concentrations [4% and 6% dimethyl-acetamide (DMA) v:v] of cryoprotectants were evaluated using in-straw freezing method in domestic chickens. A pilot study in capercaillie males, using the same conditions evaluated in chicken, was performed.</Abstract><Abstract>In chicken, we found that the LR84-4% DMA media provided the best results for freezing semen. In capercaillie study, LR84 extender seemed to be the most appropriate diluent and 4% was the better dose of DMA cryoprotectant agent. Further, based on previous studies carried out in rooster samples, we also tested the glycerol (8% v/v) as a cryoprotectant for capercaillie semen cryopreservation.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results suggest that sperm from both domestic and wild species had a similar response to freezing-thawing processes.

The dairy chain has been isolated from different sources; nevertheless, data on Arcobacter occurrence in raw milk and dairy products in Iran are still scant.</Abstract><Abstract>The present study investigates the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of virulence genes of Arcobacters species isolated from milk and dairy products.</Abstract><Abstract>Then, a total of 350 raw milk samples and 400 dairy product samples were collected from dairy supply centers in Isfahan, Iran. Presumptive Arcobacter strains were obtained by enriching samples in Oxoid&#160;Arcobacter&#160;enrichment broth (AEB) followed by the filtration of enrichment product through 0.45-&#956;m pore size membrane filters laid onto non-selective blood at 30&#176;C under microaerophilic conditions. Molecular identification of Arcobacter cryaerophilus and A. butzleri was performed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by sequencing. The disc diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates. Targeted resistance and virulence genes were detected using multiplex PCR.</Abstract><Abstract>The results show a low recovery rate of Arcobacter spp. in milk. Arcobacters were found in all types of milk, except raw camel milk, but were absent from all dairy products. Arcobacter butzleri was the predominant species in raw milk. Detection of virulence genes shows that all virulence genes targeted were found among A. butzleri, and six (cadF, cj1349, irgA, mviN, pldA, tlyA) were found among A. cryaerophilus. All A. butzleri strains and some A. cryaerophilus strains isolated from milk were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and tetracycline. All A. cryaerophilus isolates from milk were susceptible to gentamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. The distribution of resistance genes in Arcobacter strains in milk shows that all isolates carried tet(O) and blaOXA-61 genes.</Abstract><Abstract>In conclusion, the results indicate a low recovery rate of Arcobacter spp. in milk and milk products. However, a significant number of Arcobacter strains with putative virulence genes may be potential pathogens for humans and an overall increase in Arcobacter resistance to first-line antibiotics. These results highlight the need for regular surveillance of Arcobacter strains in milk and milk products in Iran.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arcobacter</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Microbial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Ribosomal, 16S</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The diagnosis was confirmed by dynamic chest radiography, tracheal endoscopy, and computed tomography (CT). Tracheal endoscopy and CT showed dropsy of the dorsal membranous wall over most of the trachea. A self-expanding Nitinol cross-and-hook braided stent was placed along the entire tracheal lumen using surgical X-ray fluoroscopy. Bacterial cultures in the trachea were negative. Dyspnoea disappeared immediately after the endotracheal stent was implanted. Although the long-term prognosis remains under observation, the short- to medium-term prognosis was very good.

Recently, evidence-based recommendations or systematic reviews for using antiseizure drugs (ASDs) in dogs and cats have been published, but there are many differences in economic, geographical, and historical backgrounds and/or the availability of each ASD between countries. In the present study, we conducted a questionnaire survey on the usage of ASDs in 511 veterinary hospitals in Japan in 2020. As a result, zonisamide (ZNS) was the most commonly prescribed drug for idiopathic (83%) and structural epilepsy (76%) in dogs. In cats, phenobarbital was the most frequently prescribed drug for idiopathic (48%) and structural epilepsy (51%), but ZNS was also commonly prescribed (41% and 36%, respectively). Additionally, ZNS was the most frequently used ASD in combination therapy for canine idiopathic epilepsy. We also surveyed the frequency of measuring ASD blood levels; however, a relatively high percentage of hospitals (22%) did not perform such measurements. Although the evidence level for ZNS is still poor for both species, it is generally used as the first-line ASD in Japan. A large-scale and higher evidential study for ZNS and the education of practitioners for adequate antiseizure medication are required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epilepsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In cattle, it can be relieved by different obstetric methods, including the cesarean operation and fetotomy. Caesarean section is the extraction of the fetus or foeti from the dam, through a surgical opening in the abdominal wall and the uterus. This surgical method can be performed by about eight alternative surgical approaches in bovines with its advantages and disadvantages. However, the selection is dependent on many factors like the type of dystocia, the cows and environmental conditions, the availability of assistants, and the surgeon's preference. For cows, most surgeons use a standing left paralumbar celiotomy. However, the left oblique approach is also preferable under most circumstances because the uterus is readily exteriorized, limiting peritoneal cavity contamination. Besides, alternative approaches are also available that will further limit the potential for contamination but many junior surgeons perform the left paralumbar celiotomy using the same approach each time due to their comfort with one specific approach or lack of familiarity with other available options. Therefore, the objective of this review is to provide basic insights and highlight the cesarean section incision approaches with their relative advantages and disadvantages in cows.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dystocia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recommendations included altering current medications (13/21 dogs), diet consistency (6/21), time upright (12/21), water delivery (21/21), and adding activity (7/21). Regurgitation episodes/week decreased significantly from 5.5 to 2.5 (p &lt;&#160;0.001) at follow-up 3-5&#160;weeks post-evaluation, with 95% of owners reporting improvement in quality of life. Seventy percent were alive 46-777 days after last recheck.

Known and proposed risk factors for uterine torsion in cattle were analysed regarding their potential importance in sheep. These included lamb birth weights, ewe age, parity, season, nutrition, breed type, litter size and husbandry.</Abstract><Abstract>Maternal causes of dystocia accounted for 67.2% (203/302) of the presented cases. Of these, insufficient cervical dilatation (121/203, 59.6%) was the most frequent diagnosis. Another substantial proportion of maternal causes (60/203, 29.6%) was identified as uterine torsion. Husbandry, breed type and litter size showed significance in univariate analyses, with lower odds for meat breeds (OR 0.22; p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001), twin- (OR 0.49; p&#160;=&#160;0.020) or multiple-bearing ewes (OR 0.19; p&#160;=&#160;0.013) and higher odds for fully housed animals (OR 17.87; p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001).

Ophthalmic exam showed lagophthalmos, retracted right upper eyelid, and resistant to retropulsion in his right eye. Under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, increased volume of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of the right eye was prominent. Immunosuppressive dosage of prednisolone partially ameliorated the clinical signs, but some clinical signs were still gradually progressive or persistent. In the second MRI scan, decreased diameter of the thickened right extraocular muscles was found. After the third MRI scan, enucleation of the right eye was performed due to substantial adverse effects of systemic steroid therapy. Histopathological examination revealed no evidence of neoplastic transformation nor infection. Feline restrictive orbital myofibroblastic sarcoma (FROMS) was therefore excluded, suggesting unknown causes of extensive fibrotic changes in the right orbit of the affected cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orbital Pseudotumor</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The result of SNT showed the presence of BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4 and, for the first time in Tunisia, BTV-26. The logistic regression model revealed that older animals had nearly two times the odds of being infected with BTV compared to younger animals. Flocks with a history of BT were almost 1.5 times more likely to be at risk for contracting BTV infection. The flock size, housing indoors and intensive production system were significant protective factors.</Abstract><Abstract>High seroprevalence of BTV among sheep was highlighted in Tunisia. The neutralization test showed the presence of the following BTV serotypes: BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4 and, for the first time in Tunisia, BTV-26.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the continuation of virus spillover events that have taken place over the last few decades, particularly in Asia and Africa. Therefore, these bat-associated epidemics provide a significant number of hints, including respiratory cellular tropism, more intense susceptibility to these cell types, and overall likely to become a pandemic for the next spillover. In this systematic review, we analysed data to insight, through bat-originated spillover in Asia and Africa. We used STATA/IC-13 software for descriptive statistics and meta-analysis. The random effect of meta-analysis showed that the pooled estimates of case fatality rates of bat-originated viral zoonotic diseases were higher in Africa (61.06%, 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l[2] % = 97.3, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, estimates of case fatality rates were higher in Ebola (61.06%; 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l[2] % = 97.3, p &lt; 0.001) followed by Nipah (55.19%; 95%CI: 39.29 to 71.09, l[2] % = 94.2, p &lt; 0.001), MERS (18.49%; 95%CI: 8.19 to 28.76, l[2] % = 95.4, p &lt; 0.001) and SARS (10.86%; 95%CI: 6.02 to 15.71, l[2] % = 85.7, p &lt; 0.001) with the overall case fatality rates of 29.86 (95%CI: 29.97 to 48.58, l[2] % = 99.0, p &lt; 0.001). Bat-originated viruses have caused several outbreaks of deadly diseases, including Nipah, Ebola, SARS and MERS in Asia and Africa in a sequential fashion. Nipah virus emerged first in Malaysia, but later, periodic outbreaks were noticed in Bangladesh and India. Similarly, the Ebola virus was detected in the African continent with neurological disorders in humans, like Nipah, seen in the Asian region. Two important coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, were introduced, both with the potential to infect respiratory passages. This paper explores the dimension of spillover events within and/or between bat-human and the epidemiological risk factors, which may lead to another pandemic occurring. Further, these processes enhance the bat-originated virus, which utilises an intermediate host to jump into human species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Africa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chiroptera</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pandemics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viruses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The study of its genetic diversity is key to implementing genetic improvement programs. This study was conducted to determine genetic diversity of reproductive traits in a Mexican Braunvieh beef cattle population using single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes. Information from 24 genes with 52 intra-genic loci reported in literature to be associated with productive life, pregnancy rate and cow and heifer conception rate of 150 Braunvieh males and females was considered. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) revealed high genetic diversity for the studied traits, Ho = 0.42 &#177; 0.087, relative to that of other populations of the same breed. Cluster analyses were carried out using the Ward and K-means algorithms. These analyses revealed high genetic diversity that was observed in the biplot of non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. It was found that clustering strategy allowed visualisation of distant groups by genotype but not by favourable alleles in all the loci. We found that the genes CSNK1E, DNAH11, DSC2, IBSP and OCLN affected most of the traits in our study and they were highly informative. Therefore, they represent a potential resource for selection and crossbreeding programs of the traits studied in Braunvieh. The analyses showed that the Mexican Braunvieh population has a high level of genetic diversity, arguably due to decades-long adaptation to the Mexican tropics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Alleles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The eye and periocular tissues showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmological examinations, except for the structure of the nictitating membrane. Histopathological examination revealed that the adhered site of the nictitating membrane and the palpebral conjunctiva consisted of dense fibrous connective tissue that was consecutive to the conjunctiva adjacent to the eyelid margin and lamina propria of the nictitating membrane. The fibrous connective tissue was covered with stratified squamous epithelium.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on these results, we diagnosed this abnormal finding as congenital nictitating membrane dysplasia. This paper is the first case report describing a congenital structural abnormality of the nictitating membrane in a Japanese white rabbit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Conjunctiva</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluorescein</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nictitating Membrane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Patient signalment, supervising surgeon, reason for surgery, limb, implants placed, anaesthetic time, duration casting/coaptation postoperatively, antibiotic regimen and incidence/onset SSI were recorded. Bayesian and frequentist logistic regressions were used to estimate the contribution of covariates to infection occurrence.</Abstract><Abstract>Fifty-four PIPJ arthrodeses were performed. SSI occurred in 2/54 (3.7%) on day 15,30. Arthrodesis was performed most commonly for osteoarthritis (33/54, 61.1%), fracture (11/54, 20.4%), and subluxation (5/54, 9.3%). Perioperative systemic antibiotics were administered 1-3 days (15/54, 27.8%) or&#160;&gt;&#160;3 days (39/54, 72.2%). Antibiotic protocols included cefazolin/gentamicin (20/54, 37%), cefazolin/gentamicin/doxycycline (14/54, 25.9%) and potassium penicillin/gentamicin (10/54, 18.5%). Regional limb perfusion was performed preoperatively 31/54 (57.4%) and postoperatively 7/54 (13%). Survival to dismissal was 98.1% (53/54 horses) with one horse euthanized due to support limb laminitis. No association was identified between antibiotic selection or duration (1-3 vs.&#160;&gt;&#160;3 days), pre-operative regional antibiotic perfusion, intraoperative antibiotic lavage or anaesthetic time&#160;(&lt;&#160;or&#160;&gt;&#160;3&#160;h) and SSI; however, modelling was complicated by quasi-complete or complete separation of the data. Bayesian analysis (but not frequentist analysis) indicated an association between post-operative regional antibiotic perfusion and SSI. Limitations include the retrospective nature of data collection and the low rate of infection overall.</Abstract><Abstract>The prevalence of SSI in this population was lower than that in previous reports of equine orthopaedic internal fixation.

Since its discovery, many antibiotics have been effective in treating bacterial infections in animals. Escherichia coli, a bacterium, is one of the reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes in a community. The current use of antibiotics and demographic factors usually increase multidrug resistance. Genetically, the continuous adoption of environmental changes by E. coli allows it to acquire many multidrug resistance. During the host's life, antimicrobial resistance rarely poses a threat to the E. coli strain and pressure, similar to that of a flexible animal lower intestine. In this review, we describe the E. coli antibiotic drug-resistance mechanism driving transmission, the causes of transmission and the harmful effects on animal health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Microbial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In the current study were monitored: increased blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate to identify an acute intraoperative nociceptive response. These parameters were registered at six times during the surgical procedure: grasping of the ovary (time 1), dissection of the mesosalpinx (time 2), tightening of the first loop ligature (time 3), tightening of the second loop ligature (time 4), transection of the ovarian pedicle (time 5) and release of the ovary (time 6).</Abstract><Abstract>Forty healthy bitches were randomly assigned in two groups (n&#160;=&#160;20) to receive topical irrigation (splash block) of 2% lidocaine (C group) on both ovarian pedicle (2&#160;mg/kg each), or an equal volume of lidocaine was injected at the same sites (R group).</Abstract><Abstract>The results of the present study suggest that splash block may provide intraoperative analgesic effects equivalent to injection in the ovarian pedicle in dogs that have undergone ovariectomy.

VL is endemic in the Middle East, also in some parts of Iran. Following reports of new cases of VL in children in Maragheh County, the non-endemic area of the disease, we encouraged to conduct a preliminary study on domestic dogs and cats to identify their potential role as reservoirs for the disease.</Abstract><Abstract>This study was conducted during a period of 3 years from 2018 to 2021. Two hundred ownership dogs and 25 cats from Maragheh County, north-west of Iran, were randomly screened. Blood samples were collected. A direct agglutination test (DAT) was used for the detection of anti-L. infantum antibodies. Furthermore, buffy coat samples from the L. infantum seropositive animals were examined to detect parasite presence using polymerase chain reaction.</Abstract><Abstract>Out of the total of 200 ownership dogs evaluated, 170 (85%) were male and 30 (15%) were female with a mean age of 4.3&#160;years.

Physical examination, vaginal cytology, haematological, and ultrasonographic findings were indicative of a uterine stump pyometra. A celiotomy was performed, and the uterine&#160;stump&#160;appeared grossly cystic&#160;and thickened.&#160;Histopathological evaluation of the removed uterine stump and ovarian pedicles&#160;revealed&#160;cystic endometrial hyperplasia&#160;and no ovarian tissue.&#160;Fifteen days after surgery, the patient presented again with a sanguineous vulvar discharge.&#160;Vaginal cytology&#160;revealed&#160;predominantly superficial cells, indicating oestrogen influence. Further questioning of the owner revealed the long-term use of&#160;a topical&#160;oestrogen cream&#160;by a member of the household.&#160;Serial examinations&#160;were performed, and the cytology remained uniform, with predominantly superficial cells, indicating continued oestrogen influence.&#160;Progesterone and anti-M&#252;llerian&#160;hormone tests were&#160;negative, which&#160;made the presence of ectopic ovarian tissue unlikely. These results coupled with the history of topical oestrogen cream use in the household suggested that&#160;the patient's clinical signs&#160;were&#160;most likely due to&#160;exogenous oestrogen exposure. After the owner implemented various recommendations made to prevent the exposure, the clinical signs resolved completely.</Abstract><Abstract>This case demonstrates that although rare, exogenous oestrogen exposure can be a cause of vulvar discharge in a large-breed spayed bitch.

<Rec><Common><PMID>35654083</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Mesenteric lymph node abscesses due to Escherichia coli in a cat.</Title>	<Abstract>A 3-year-old, castrated male mixed-breed cat presented with an almost 2-year history of chronic loose stools. On radiography and ultrasound examination, there were two masses in the centre of the abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed that the masses were enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with fluid accumulation. Percutaneous lesion drainage yielded pus-like fluid. Fluid cytology revealed numerous neutrophils and Gram-negative rods. Pus culture identified Escherichia coli as the causative organism. Consequently, mesenteric lymph node abscesses were definitively diagnosed. Since computed tomography showed that the abscesses adhered to the surrounding tissues, it was difficult to remove them surgically. With drainage and antimicrobial therapy, the mesenteric lymph nodes gradually decreased in size. However, loose stools persisted. The cat's diet was changed to a hydrolysed diet, and the clinical symptoms improved, suggesting food-responsive enteropathy. This may be an underlying disease of lymph node abscesses. Lymph node abscesses limited to the mesenteric lymph nodes rarely occur in veterinary medicine, and this is the first report in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdomen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymph Nodes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Numerous studies have shown that circRNAs are extensively involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, gene transcription and signal transduction. Fat deposition and muscle development have important effects on beef traits. CircRNAs are involved in regulating bovine fat and muscle cells and are differentially expressed in the tissues composed of these cells, suggesting that circRNAs play an important role in regulating bovine fat formation and muscle development. This review describes differential expression of circRNAs in bovine fat and muscle tissues, research progress in understanding how circRNAs regulate the proliferation and differentiation of bovine fat and muscle cells through competing endogenous RNAs networks, and provide a reference for the subsequent research on the molecular mechanism of circRNAs in regulating fat deposition and muscle development in cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Regulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>MicroRNAs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscle Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Circular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>RNA, Messenger</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The results from both statistical approaches showed very similar heritabilities (h[2]), ranging from 0.192 to 0.237 for the direct genetic (D) effects and from 0.072 to 0.082 for the maternal genetic (M) effects, but the antagonism between (D) and (M) was higher when a longitudinal model was used. A significant genotype-environmental effect was also found regardless of whether the climatological covariables were considered in the model. In addition, we employed D and M breeding values for W30 as an example to create a new subjacent index by first using a principal component analysis and employing the leading eigenvalues as a weighted factor that provides the information needed to identify those genotypes that maximise the response for both genetic effects over a wide range of climate-environment levels.</Abstract><Abstract>Our study revealed that the HS indexes of the mother during the gestation period have a significant effect on the growth of the lambs during the early stages of life.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birth Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Response</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weaning</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

For several decades, genetic breeding programmes have been devoted to them at the Centre de Recherches Zootechniques de Dahra and Kolda. Since then, these animals have been subjected to mass selection, mainly in closed selection nuclei.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to assess the genetic diversity within these selection nuclei in order to orient future selection strategies.</Abstract><Abstract>The study was carried out on the Gobra zebu and N'dama taurine populations from selection nuclei of Dahra and Kolda respectively, which were compared to 5 other populations of the main cattle breeds in Senegal. One hundred eighty (180) animals were genotyped with 21 microsatellite markers recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.</Abstract><Abstract>All populations were found to be polymorphic with a PIC of over 55%. However, animals from the CRZ-Dahra (indigenous) and CRZ-Kolda stations had the lowest mean heterozygosity (0.643 and 0.591 respectively). The other populations had an average heterozygosity between 0.650 and 0.737.</Abstract><Abstract>The cattle populations maintained at the different CRZs show a lower genetic diversity than the other populations described in our study.

Nested PCR was employed to amplify a 298-bp fragment of the pol gene. The BIV Pol sequence was detected in 9.1% of the samples. Among PCR-positive samples, two amplified fragments were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.</Abstract><Abstract>The studied sequences were completely identical to each other and had more than 98%-99% nucleotide homology to R-29 and HXB3 sequences previously deposited in GenBank. Some point mutations that caused coding substitutions were observed in the studied isolates, compared to other strains. A phylogenetic tree was generated based on the BIV Pol nucleotide sequences reported from other countries. All the BIV strains originated from a unique main cluster and then separated from each other over time. This is the first report on the molecular detection of BIV infections in water buffalo populations in Iran. The wide distribution of BIV in different countries including Iran indicates the importance of the infection as it relates to animal health. Although buffaloes show greater resistance to diseases, they should be considered a health risk to cattle. Furthermore, BIV has negative effects on buffalo milk production and can predispose them to secondary infections. Hence, the findings of this study can advance our understanding of the occurrence of BIV infection in Iran, which can play an important role in the distribution of the disease worldwide.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lentivirus Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nucleotides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A toatal of 384 cattle were used for this study. Tick species were identified using morphological identification keys under a stereomicroscope. Thin blood smear examination were conducted to assess tick borne haemopathogens.</Abstract><Abstract>The overall prevalence of Ixodid tick infestation and tick borne haemopathogens were 45% and 3%, respectively. Babesia bigemina was the only haemoparasite detected in the present survey. Potential risk factors were investigated for their association with tick infestation and B. bigemina using logistic regression and chi-square test, respectively. Accordingly, age, body condition, agroecological systems and season were significantly (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) associated with tick infestation whereas season and body condition were significantly (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) associated with B. bigemina infection. A total seven tick species were identified. Amblyomma varigatum (55%) and Boophilus decoloratus (15.7%) were the predominant Ixodid tick species encountered. A total of 128 blood samples were collected from Jawi district and examined using thin blood smear. Of them, 3% were infected by the B. bigemina CONCLUSIONS: Tick infestation in this study was high and seems to play vital role for the reduction of production, productivity and for the transmission B. bigemina. Therefore, sound and effective tick control and prevention strategies are needed to mitigate the risk factors for tick infestation and B. bigemina infection in Ethiopia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethiopia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ixodidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tick Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ticks</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Calf morbidity and mortality reports in Ethiopia mostly focus on market-oriented dairy production systems. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in central Ethiopia with the objectives of estimating the magnitude of calf morbidity and mortality across three production systems and contributing risk factors.</Abstract><Abstract>A cross-sectional study was conducted at pastoral, mixed-crop livestock, and dairy farms in central Ethiopia from February 2019 to June 2019 to collect 1-year retrospective and cross-sectional data on calf morbidity and mortality from smallholder farmers using a structured questionnaire.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 293 smallholder farmers were involved in the study. Among the households interviewed, 83% of respondents encountered feed shortages in the year prior to this study. The overall annual calf morbidity prevalence and mortality rate were 6.49% (95% CI: 4.87-8.44) and 10% (95% CI: 8.28-11.93), respectively. Morbidity was higher in Dalocha and Sululta districts in mixed crop-livestock and peri-urban production systems, respectively. Logistic regression analysis of potential risk factors indicated that calf morbidity was associated with the calf and dam body condition score (BCS). Calves with BCS of 3 (medium) were less likely to be morbid (odds ratio [OR]: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.07-0.56]) than calves with BCS of 1 (emaciated), and calves born from dams with a body condition score of 2 (thin) were also at lower risk (OR: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07-0.95]) than calves born from emaciated dams. The odds of calf mortality in Awash Fentale district were higher (OR: 6.19 [95% CI: 2.09-18.32]) compared to Sululta district.</Abstract><Abstract>The study results revealed that the production system and management affect the magnitude of calf morbidity and mortality.

The objective of this study is to estimate the morbidity and mortality rates of kids and adult goats, identify important risk factors for mortality using survival analysis and summarise important causes of goat death.</Abstract><Abstract>Nonparametric survival analysis and a piecewise exponential model (PEM) were used.</Abstract><Abstract>The mortality rates of kids and adult goats were 0.629 and 0.302 per animal year, respectively. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of survival time of kids were 5, 162 and 1300 days, respectively, and those of adults and goats were 280, 828 and 1,735 days, respectively. Gastrointestinal-related diseases, pneumonia, weak kid, agalactia, mismothering and heartwater (cowdriosis) were the most important causes of mortality. Constant piecewise exponential regression analysis of risk factors indicated that breed, kid birth weight, doe post-partum weight (PPWT), birth type, birth year and precipitation variables were associated with (p-value&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) kid mortality rate. Pure Boer kids compared with Central Highland goat cross with Boer goats were 2.505 times at a higher probability of mortality (p-value&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001). A 1-kg increase in kid birth weight and dam PPWT reduces mortality probability by 32.5% (p-value&#160;=&#160;0.000) and 6.4% (p-value&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001), respectively. Twin birth kids had a 1.512 times higher rate of mortality (p-value&#160;=&#160;0.001) than single-born kids.

<Rec><Common><PMID>35820027</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Orthotopic ureterocele with concurrent ureteral urothelial carcinoma in a dog.</Title>	<Abstract>A ureterocele is a rare congenital anomaly with cystic dilation of the terminal segment of the ureter entirely within the bladder (orthotopic) or associated with ectopic ureter (ectopic). Its aetiology has not been fully clarified; however, it may involve genetic or acquired factors. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the most common type of canine urinary tract neoplasm, among which over 90% of cases are invasive. The non-papillary (flat) non-infiltrating form accounts for a very small percentage of canine UCs and is considered carcinoma in situ (CIS). The neoplastic cells of CIS remain within the ureteral mucosa and do not breach the basement membrane. UCs originating from the canine ureter are extremely rare, and no report of a ureteral UC concurrently occurring with a ureterocele has been reported. A 7-year-old castrated male Maltese dog weighing 3.5 kg was referred with a 2-week history of lethargy, anorexia, pollakiuria and intermittent panting. The dog underwent open surgery for removal of bladder calculi 2 years prior, and at the time of the surgery, no other urinary system abnormalities were identified. Ultrasonographic and computed tomographic scans revealed a severely enlarged right kidney and ureter with a ureterocele on the ipsilateral side. A diagnosis of an orthotopic ureterocele causing hydronephrosis and hydroureter was established. Complete nephroureterectomy and ureterocelectomy using the marsupialisation technique were performed. The postoperative histological examination of the excised tissues showed a multifocal carcinoma in situ (non-papillary non-infiltrating UC) in the proximal ureter and a fluid-filled kidney with a thin rim of fibrotic renal tissue. No neoplastic changes were observed in the ureterocele tissue. Postoperatively, the dog recovered rapidly without complications except temporary urinary incontinence, and no evidence of tumour recurrence was detected by ultrasonography performed 6 months after surgery. This case report describes the first case of a dog with an orthotopic ureterocele and ureteral UC, which occurred concurrently at the ipsilateral side of the ureter. The condition was successfully managed with a nephroureterectomy and partial ureterocelectomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma in Situ</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Transitional Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ureterocele</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Colonies were evaluated for aggressiveness, hygienic behaviour, brood area, pollen and nectar stores, absconding and honey yield.</Abstract><Abstract>The results indicated that colonies were generally aggressive, and the majority of colonies at 2.3-m away from the entrance reacted to the external body. They removed 95.7% &#177; 0.75% of the pin-killed pupae in 24 h, and there was significant (p &lt; 0.05) variation among the different observations. The average population of the brood was 24.925 &#177; 7.714 unit area of brood/hive during the honey flow period. Similarly, the area allocated for storing pollen grains could reach up to 11.46 &#177; 3.96-unit area of pollen/hive. The swarming and absconding behaviour of the race was on average 3.39&#160;&#177; 0.6, and 25% queen cells were found during the breeding season and dearth period, respectively. On average, the 8.85 &#177; 0.54 kg honey yield per colony per harvest on one honey chamber box was nearly similar to the national average (19.4 kg/hive/year) when harvested two times per year.</Abstract><Abstract>In general, the Apis mellifera secutellata race is good in hygienic tendency and also performs well for honey yield under optimal management practices. The absconding and aggressive behaviour was high; the main reasons were extreme weather condition, and different pest and disease, seasonality of bee flora were the major ones. So, based on the current findings A. m. scutellata was predominantly available in the area and highly productive if well-managed. On the other hand, we are recommended on dearth period management and on the height of shade bee colonies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Bees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethiopia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seasons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urticaria</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The study design is retrospective. Six client-owned horses developed caecal dysfunction following a variety of surgical procedures undertaken in the standing sedated horse. Medical records were reviewed for caecal dysfunctions that had occurred in horses within 2 weeks of standing surgical procedures. Signalment, details of the original standing surgery and medications administered were recorded. Short-term outcome was obtained from clinical records. Long-term outcome was obtained by telephone questionnaire with the owner. Six horses were identified to have developed caecal dysfunction following standing surgery for tooth extraction, laparoscopic ovariectomy, laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy, fracture repair, melanoma removal and castration. Three horses were euthanised with caecal perforation at the time of diagnosis. Three underwent surgical treatment (typhlotomy, decompression and caecal bypass by ileocolostomy). All three horses were alive post-operatively (follow-up at 2, 12 and 24 months). Caecal dysfunction may develop following surgical procedures performed under standing sedation. Careful post-operative monitoring and early identification of caecal dysfunction, and consequent potential need for surgical intervention, are important to optimise outcomes and minimise the risk of fatal caecal perforation occurring.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cecum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this work, the optimal reference genes for RT-qPCR normalisation in plasma samples of rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were identified.</Abstract><Abstract>Six rat MCAO models were established. Blood samples were collected before modelling and approximately 16-24 h after modelling. Two commonly used reference genes (U6 and 5S) and three miRNAs (miR-24, miR-122 and miR-9a) were selected as candidate reference genes, and the expression of these genes was detected with RT-qPCR. The acquired data were analysed using geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and comparative delta threshold cycle statistical models.</Abstract><Abstract>The analysed results consistently showed that miR-24 was the most stably expressed reference gene. The 'optimal combination' calculated by geNorm was miR-24, U6 and5S. The expression level of the target gene miR124 was similar when the most stable reference gene miR-24 or the 'optimal combination' was used as a reference gene. However, compared with miR24 or the 'optimal combination', the less stable reference genes influenced the fold change and the data accuracy with a large standard deviation.</Abstract><Abstract>These results confirmed the importance of selecting suitable reference genes for normalisation to obtain reliable results in RT-qPCR studies and demonstrated that the identified reference gene miR-24 or the 'optimal combination' could be used as an internal control for gene expression analysis in the rat MCAO model.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>MicroRNAs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

For this purpose, radiographic images of 70 cats (37 male and 33 females) of different ages (from one to 18 years) and different breeds (41 mix-breed, 18 Scottish Fold and 11 British Shorthair cats) without orthopaedic problems were used. Right tarsal joint radiographs of these orthopaedically healthy cats were taken. Four linear measurements and two angle values of the calcaneus were obtained from the radiographic images. The MANOVA result showed that the most determining factor between the three groups was the greatest width (p value = 0.001). Calcaneal body length, calcaneal greatest length and calcaneal shortest depth were higher in mix-breed cats. Calcaneal tuber length was higher in Scottish Fold cats. The only statistically significant difference between Scottish Fold and British Shorthair was in the calcaneal tuber length (p value = 0.04). In the comparison made between the sexes regardless of species, the linear measurements in males were higher than in females. It was determined that these parameters are statistically significant in terms of sex differentiation in cats. Dorsal and plantar calcaneal angles are not sex determinants in cats. The effect of age on other measurements was analysed by correlation test. However, the effect of age on the measurements was not statistically significant. Mix-breed cats were examined in four groups according to their colour (grey, black-white, yellow, tri-colour). No statistically significant difference was found between calcaneal measurements of cats with different skin colour genotypes. In this study, calcaneus measurements were both determinative between breeds and sexes in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcaneus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, there have been a series of consultations regarding the fact that night barking, which is an abnormal behaviour, remarkably interferes with the owner's sleep and adversely affects the owner's quality of life. However, there has been no effective solution to this problem. In this study, three aged pet dogs diagnosed with dementia were administered an equine placental extract (eqPE) as pet supplement, which has been shown in laboratory models to improve cognitive function. Consequently, night barking ceased 1 week after the administration of eqPE in case 2 and it was observed to decrease in the other two dogs. Furthermore, night barking disappeared 2 and 3 weeks after the administration of eqPE in cases 1 and 3, respectively. No recurrence or exacerbation of night barking was observed in the three cases treated with the eqPE, and no adverse events were observed. These results suggest that eqPE may be useful for improving night barking in pet dogs with dementia, and it is expected to be a new treatment method.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cognitive Dysfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dementia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placenta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placental Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The LOM virus has since spread across the island and has become endemic in Jeju herds, raising concern about possible reversion to the virulence of the LOM vaccine. We previously isolated LOM-derived field CSF virus (CSFV) strains with unique insertion-deletion (INDEL) mutations in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), designated LOM-derived Jeju 3'-UTR INDEL variants, from CSF-recurrent swine farms on Jeju Island in 2019.</Abstract><Abstract>The present study conducted animal experiments to investigate whether a 2019 emergent LOM 3'-UTR INDEL variant, KNU-1905, has reverted to a pathogenic form in conventional pigs (n = 10).</Abstract><Abstract>Experimental animal infection showed that pigs inoculated with the commercial LOM vaccine strain developed no adverse effects compared to the sham-infected pigs. However, KNU-1905 displayed pathogenic characteristics in pigs, including clinical symptoms (e.g., lethargy, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, and diarrhoea), weight loss, and gross lesions. Moreover, viremia, virus shedding in faeces and nasal fluids, and viral loads in various tissues of all the KNU-1905-infected pigs were highly significant, in contrast to those of the LOM-infected group in which CSFV RNA was detected only in the serum, nasal, and tonsil samples of one identical pig.</Abstract><Abstract>Overall, the LOM-derived field isolate with molecular variations induced clinical adverse events in pigs, which commonly shed considerable amounts of CSFV. This study provides evidence that the genetic evolution of the LOM-derived CSFV circulating on Jeju Island might have allowed the LOM vaccine to recover its primary prototype and that these variants might have induced chronic or persistent infection in pigs that can shed CSFV in field farms leading to a risk of transmission among pigs or farms in this former CSF-free region.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Classical Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Classical Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Virulence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Republic of Korea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

PCR was used to amplify and detect N. caninum DNA in tissues samples followed by sequencing of some PCR products. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed to compare the partial sequences of the ITS1 gene with GenBank sequences. Histopathology examination was used to detect Neospora spp. cysts, but no lesions were observed.</Abstract><Abstract>The overall molecular detection of N. caninum in camelids was 34.3% (12/35). The highest molecular detection of N. caninum was recorded in animals of more than 3 years old (6/9) and in animals aged between 1 and 3 years old (4/12). Whilst, the lowest molecular detection (2/14) was observed in animals 1 year or younger (p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in molecular detection of N. caninum according to both locality and gender (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, there was no difference of prevalence between different anatomical locations. Comparison of the partial sequences of the ITS1 gene revealed 100-95.5% similarity among our N. caninum amplicon (MW551566) and those deposited in GenBank.</Abstract><Abstract>These results highlight the presence of a risk infection by N. caninum in camels. For preventing N. caninum infection further studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the epidemiology of neosporosis in North Africa.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Camelus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coccidiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neospora</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tunisia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This particular study included 384 animals. Milk samples were collected and screened with California mastitis test. Then bacteria were cultured and identified using biochemical tests and disc diffusion test was used to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity for MRSA.</Abstract><Abstract>The prevalence of mastitis was 121 (31.5%). Among them, 37 cases (30.6%) were clinical mastitis and 84 cases (69.4%) were subclinical mastitis. Among these positive cases, 37 cases (30.6%) of S. aureus were isolated. The prevalence of mastitis was significantly related to the breed, age, floor type and sanitation status of the milking (p &lt;0.05). The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was performed on Mueller Hinton agar medium according to NCCLS guidelines to test antibiotic sensitivity. The 32.4% of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. Isolates of MRSA are more resistant to amoxicillin (75%), oxytetracycline (66.7%) and sulfa (50%). However, they were sensitive to kanamycin (75%), streptomycin (58.3%) and nalidixic acid (50%). Insufficient dosage, short treatment time and chronic infection in dairy cows in the herd are the main reasons for the large number of resistant strains.</Abstract><Abstract>Generally, mastitis was prevalent in the area, and it was resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

Thus, there is a critical need to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of this disease, particularly in dairy cows.</Abstract><Abstract>This study confirmed the effects of the combined use of two non-laboratory methods: Metricheck device (MT) and ultrasonography (UT) to detect signs of endometritis and therefore predict the likelihood of pregnancy.</Abstract><Abstract>The reproductive tract of 67 lactating Holstein cows (25 primiparous and 42 multiparous) was observed at 4 and 6 weeks postpartum using the MT and UT. The cows with flecks and more purulent material in the vaginal discharge were defined as MT-positive, and the cows with uterine echogenic contents were defined as UT-positive. The combined definition was also used; both the UT and MT results or either the UT or MT result had to be positive for the final decision to be positive. The true-negative cows were determined as both MT-UT-negative.</Abstract><Abstract>When comparing the diagnostic results obtained by MT and UT, 37.3% and 32.8% of the total cows showed conflicting results at 4 and 6 weeks postpartum. The proportion of non-pregnant cows until 200 days postpartum was significantly greater in both MT-UT-positive cows than in the true negative cows. The hazard ratios of pregnancy rate were 0.37 for both MT-UT-positives relative to the true negatives at 4 weeks postpartum. Similar significant differences were not detected using the MT or UT alone. These results indicate that a more severe effect on the chance of pregnancy could be detected in cows that are both MT-UT-positive compared with those positive for MT or UT alone.</Abstract><Abstract>The combined use of MT and UT could support veterinary practitioners in diagnosing endometritis, potentially improving the accuracy of predicting subsequent reproductive performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endometritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postpartum Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of the study were to estimate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors in Weliso, Ambo, and Ejaji towns in the Southwest and West Shewa zones, Oromia, Ethiopia.</Abstract><Abstract>A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 to September 2020. A total of 368 canines were sampled for the study using a basic random sampling procedure. An Indirect ELISA kit was used to test the presence of rK39 antigen eliciting specific antibodies in a serum sample. The association between L. infantum seropositivity and possible risk factors was assessed using Pearson's Chi-square and logistic regression tests.</Abstract><Abstract>The overall seroprevalence of L. infantum in dogs was found to be 84.24% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80%-88%) with seroprevalences ranging from 76.11% (95% CI: 67%-84%) in Ambo to 79.82% (95% CI: 71%-87%) in Weliso, and higher seroprevalence, in Ejaji 93.84% (95% CI: 89%-97%). In a univariable logistic regression analysis, town (p&#160;=&#160;0.001), season (p&#160;=&#160;0.001), mixed living (indoor/outdoor) environment (p&#160;=&#160;0.003), and kebele (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.05) were all found to be significantly linked with L. infantum seropositivity. In the multivariable analysis, wet season (p&#160;=&#160;0.001) and mixed living environments (p&#160;=&#160;0.025) were found to be independent predictors of L. infantum seropositivity.</Abstract><Abstract>This is the first comprehensive report of L. infantum infection in Ethiopian dogs. The very high seroprevalence suggests that dogs may play an important role in maintaining and spreading the infection to humans. Improvement of the living environment and health care facilities for dogs and humans as well health education for people awareness is suggested.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethiopia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmania infantum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmaniasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical and radiological examination demonstrated an expansile neoplastic mass in the nasal and frontal sinuses. On necropsy, an amorphous neoplastic mass and extensive necrosis were observed in the nasal turbinate. Microscopic examination revealed a tumour principally composed of obvious clear tumour cells characterised by small hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant clear cytoplasm. These clear cells were positive for mucin with PAS, PAS-D reaction, and alcian blue (pH 2.5) staining, but negative for PTAH staining. Immunohistochemically, some of tumour cells were strongly positive for mesenchymal cells (vimentin), whereas they were negative for myoepithelial antigen (alpha-SMA) and cytokeratin. Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical features, the present case was diagnosed as high-grade clear cell variant mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC).

However, to the best of author's knowledge, there are no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis owing to decreased tear production following removal of the NM gland. This case study demonstrates the tear production changes in a dog for a year after removal of the nictitating membrane (NM) due to suspicion of a malignant tumour. A 13-year-old spayed female English Cocker Spaniel who had suffered from severe ocular discharge, discomfort, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), and NM enlargement in the right eye was brought to our hospital. The dog could not tolerate treatment with topical 0.2% cyclosporine or corticosteroids. The dog's right eye had NM gland prolapse, severe follicular conjunctivitis and a very low Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) value of 3 mm/min. Furthermore, the result of fine needle aspiration of the enlarged NM gland suggested a risk of malignancy. Despite the risk of KCS, complete NM resection was performed to diagnose the tumour. Fortunately, the final histopathological evaluation revealed chronic inflammation without any evidence of malignancy. Contrary to concerns that the STT-1 value would further decrease after the removal of the NM gland, the STT-1 value remained elevated compared to that before surgery, and the clinical symptoms improved for a year. It is generally known that NM gland resection is not recommended due to the risk of developing iatrogenic KCS unless a malignant tumour is suspected. In this case, surgical removal of the inflammatory NM gland that was not responsive to medications had a positive effect on KCS. Since the inflammatory and structural disease of the NM was strengthening KCS, the outcome was thought to be different from that when the normal third eyelid was removed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nictitating Membrane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Conjunctivitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Yaks are a valuable species and an iconic symbol of the Tibet Plateau which is the highest and largest plateau in the world. In this study, a total of 105 yak diarrheal samples, collected from 13 farms in Linzhi in the Tibet Plateau from January 2019 to December 2021, that were screened for P1 and PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction, 10.48% (n = 11) were positive for P1, 4.76% (n = 5) for PCV2, and 5.71% (n = 6) were positive for coinfection of P1 and PCV2. In addition, the whole genomes of eight P1 strains and eight PCV2 strains were sequenced. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of P1 ORF1 and PCV2 ORF2 gene revealed that ON012566 had one unique amino acid mutation at residues 137 (T to P). This mutation has important implication for the study of virus virulence, tissue tropism, and immune response. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the yak-origin P1 strains in this study with cattle-origin P1 reference strains were grouped into one cluster. The yak-origin PCV2 (ON012566) and a buffalo-origin PCV2 (KM116514) reference strain clustered in the same branch in the PCV2b regions. Meanwhile, the remaining PCV2 strains and buffalo-origin PCV2 reference strain (ON012565) clustered in the PCV2d regions. To summarize, to our knowledge, this is the first report on the molecular prevalence and genome characteristics of P1 and PCV2 in yaks in the world and will contribute to further study of the molecular epidemiology, source, and evolution of P1 and PCV2 strains.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Circovirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sequence Analysis, DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>China</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although CT findings of several pelvic tumours have been reported in veterinary medicine, MRI findings are limited.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the CT and MRI findings in dogs with vaginal leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma.</Abstract><Abstract>This retrospective study of five dogs compared the CT and MRI findings of intrapelvic lesions, including vaginal leiomyoma (n&#160;=&#160;4) and leiomyosarcoma (n&#160;= 1). No invasion of the surrounding tissue was detected on histopathological examination. In this retrospective study, the following parameters of CT and MRI were recorded for each dog: the border between the lesion and the adjacent pelvic organs, including the prostate, rectum or urethra; signal intensity (SI) of the lesion; enhancement pattern; presence of haemorrhage; necrosis or cystic areas and lymphadenopathy. Because SI on MRI is affected by cell density, tumour cell density was analysed using a microscope slide.</Abstract><Abstract>In vaginal leiomyoma, the border between the lesion and the surrounding pelvic organ tends to be clearer on MRI than on CT. In vaginal leiomyosarcoma, the border was comparable between MRI and CT. Each lesion showed heterogeneous enhancement on CT and MRI scans. In each lesion, the assessment of haemorrhage, necrosis, cystic areas and lymphadenopathy was comparable between MRI and CT. The SI of the lesion on T2WI of the vaginal leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma were hyperintense in four cases (4/4; 100%) and mixed intense in one case (1/1; 100%), respectively. The cell density of leiomyosarcoma is higher than that of leiomyomas.</Abstract><Abstract>The SI on T2WI may be useful for differentiating leiomyoma from leiomyosarcoma. MRI may be useful to differentiate vaginal leiomyomas from leiomyosarcomas and evaluate margins.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leiomyosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leiomyoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphadenopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Margins of Excision</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Necrosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cortisol levels after the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test were within the therapeutic range, but aldosterone levels were below the reference range; hence, isolated hypoaldosteronism was diagnosed. After administration of deoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP), the electrolyte imbalance improved with a Na:K ratio of 27.7. This is the first report of the management of isolated hypoaldosteronism and hypercortisolism using trilostane and DOCP in a dog.

This problem has increased the price of animal feed due to competition with human consumption. Meanwhile, the physiology of ruminants gives them the ability to use by-products and agricultural waste and supply their requirements for growth, maintenance and even production. Berberis vulgaris is a plant native to Iran, and after separating the fruit, its waste (mainly leaf) is unused and causes environmental pollution. The leaves of this plant contain significant amounts of phenolic compounds, alkaloids and anthocyanins that have antioxidant properties.</Abstract><Abstract>This experiment was conducted with the aim of determining the chemical properties of barberry leaves, such as crude protein, phenolic compounds, tannins and alkaloids. The effects of substituting of B. vulgaris leaf (BVL) in the diet on performance characteristics of fattening Baluchi lambs were evaluated. The quality and antioxidant status of meat and blood parameters such as glucose, cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen and liver enzymes were investigated.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 21 male of 5-6 months old lambs with a mean body weight of 30.60&#160;&#177;&#160;1.28&#160;kg were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments with different levels of BVL: 1-diet without BVL (control), 2-diet containing 7.5% BVL (BVL7.5), and 3-diet containing 15% BVL (BVL15; dry matter [DM] basis). Blood samples were harvested after overnight fasting from the jugular vein at 0, 28, 56 and 84 days. The lambs were slaughtered after 84 days of feeding trial and&#160;longissimus dorsi&#160;(LD) muscle was dissected. Meat quality and antioxidant stability status were measured.</Abstract><Abstract>15% substitution of alfalfa hay by BVL (BVL15) increased DM intake) and decreased average daily gain (p&#160;&#8804; 0.05). The LD muscle (p&#160;&#8804; 0.05), liver (p&#160;&#8804; 0.01) and plasma (p&#160;&#8804; 0.05) samples of lambs fed either BVL7.5 or BVL15 displayed a greater total antioxidant capacity than that of lambs fed the control diet. Also, malondialdehyde concentration was decreased in plasma (p&#160;&#8804; 0.01) and LD muscle of lambs (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.05) fed both BVL7.5 and BVL15. In addition, higher a* and C* values (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.05) were observed in the meat of lambs fed BVL15 than those fed with the control, while the lightness (L*) in BVL15 was lower, compared to other experimental diets CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicated that 7.5% substitution of alfalfa hay by BVL may positively modulate the antioxidant status of fattening lambs and improve the colour stability of meat without negative effects on performance characteristics.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthocyanins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Berberis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medicago sativa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Leaves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

From 188 SCM samples, 291 isolates were obtained with a prevalence of S. aureus in 37.4% (109/291) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolutionary divergence of S. aureus isolates in bubaline SCM milk samples. The antibiogram profiling showed that about 96.0% S. aureus isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Notably, 29 and 16 isolates harboured methicillin-resistant (mecA) and panton-valentine leucocidin (pvl) genes, respectively, and 46 plasmid-bearing isolates were MDR.

Treatment is challenging due to the disease's resistance to antifungal drugs. Surgical resection is frequently attempted in cases of pythiosis; however, it can be technically challenging. This report presents two dogs with decreased appetite, abdominal pain, progressive haematochezia, tenesmus and significant weight loss. With the medical histories of both being young canines, living in areas with access to natural water resources and with the main chronic gastrointestinal symptoms having not responded to symptomatic treatment, pythiosis was taken into consideration. Abdominal ultrasound revealed severe, diffuse thickening and loss of normal layering of the colonic wall. These findings led to a differential diagnosis between intestinal neoplasia and fungal disease. Full-thickness biopsies were later performed, and immunohistochemistry staining was suggested for colonic pythiosis. Medical treatment for pythiosis was successful with a combination of oral terbinafine and prednisolone. However, therapy with itraconazole in case 1 did not improve the clinical signs, and in case 2, itraconazole was used after all clinical signs have improved for clinical control. Since then, there has been no recurrence of clinical signs until the time of preparing this report (19 months for case 1, 11 months for case 2 since the cessation of treatment). The treatment was successful based on clinical signs and ultrasonographic data, and the disease remission was not confirmed by advance imaging, monitoring of pythiosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent essay concentration or repeat sampling.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pythiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Itraconazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thailand</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At exploratory laparotomy the metallic object (projectile) was identified and retrieved under fluoroscopic guidance. Four weeks following the surgery, the abdominal distention resolved and the physical exam was unremarkable. Chyloabdomen is a rare presentation which usually carries a guarded prognosis.

<Rec><Common><PMID>36282009</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>A review on molecular detection techniques of white spot syndrome virus: Perspectives of problems and solutions in shrimp farming.</Title>	<Abstract>This review aims to provide an update on the current scientific understanding of various aspects of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) formation, diagnostic procedures, transmission, ecological effects, pathophysiology and management strategies. In terms of production and financial benefits, the WSSV has been the most virulent in shrimp and several other crustacean sectors around the globe. It spreads vertically from diseased broodstock to post-larvae and horizontally by cannibalism, invertebrate vectors, freshwater and sediments. In the transfer of white spot disease (WSD) in newly stocked ponds, the survivability of WSSV in sediment is the most important variable. In typical cultural conditions, it is a highly infectious pathogen capable of inflicting total death within 3-10 days after an outbreak. Some of the current biosecurity strategies used to keep diseases out of shrimp ponds such as pond water disinfection, quarantine of new stocks before stocking and broader usage of specific pathogen-free shrimp. The sequencing and characterisation of various WSSV strains have provided details about pathogen biology, pathogenicity and disease. To develop successful control methods, knowledge of these characteristics is essential. In several shrimp-producing countries in Asia and the Americas, the infections produced by the WSSV have had disastrous socio-economic consequences. As a result of international trade or migration of diseased species, the World Animal Health Organization recognised several illnesses as posing a substantial hazard to farmed shrimp. WSD is receiving much scientific research due to the potential economic effects of the virus. Research is now being done to understand better the molecular biology and pathophysiology of WSSV, as well as how to treat and prevent the virus. However, further study should be conducted in countries with more resilient host species to understand their role in mitigating disease impacts since these revelations may aid in developing a WSD treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Agriculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aquaculture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Commerce</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>White spot syndrome virus 1</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At 10 and 13 woa, liver and testis, cloacal gland index, sera concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and testosterone, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), testicular histology, mRNA abundance of Hsp70 and fatty acid profile of testis, as well as hatchability and fertility, were measured.</Abstract><Abstract>Liver and testis weights, cloacal gland index, serum concentration of testosterone, ALT, MDA, TAC, mRNA abundance of HSP70, hatchability, and fertility were not affected by the treatments. However, Cd administration decreased seminiferous tubule diameter and seminiferous epithelium thickness (SET) in the PC group compared to the NC group (p&#160;&lt; 0.05). The proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in testis tissue was increased, and the proportion of PUFA and n-3 to n-6 PUFA ratio was decreased in the PC group compared to the NC group (p&#160;&lt; 0.05). In addition, CoQ10 supplementation ameliorated the effect of Cd on decreasing SFA and increasing n-3 to n-6 PUFA ratio proportions.</Abstract><Abstract>In conclusion, Cd exerts several adverse effects on reproductive-associated variables; some, but not all, of them are mitigated by CoQ10 supplementation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coturnix</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadmium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Amikacin and erythromycin, which are from the aminoglycoside and macrolide antibiotic families, are used to treat respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa.</Abstract><Abstract>This study explored whether amikacin, erythromycin or a combination of both works better against P. aeruginosa acute lung infection.</Abstract><Abstract>For this study, 32 rats were used. The trachea of rats was exposed aseptically and their lung was infected with P. aeruginosa through trachea. Then, according to the group, they received amikacin, erythromycin or a combination of both for 1 week. Finally, they were euthanised on the 3rd and 7th days post-infection. The macroscopic and microscopic evaluations of the lungs, kidney and liver were performed. The right lung was collected for in vivo bacteriological analysis.</Abstract><Abstract>The amikacin group (A group) had a statistically significantly lower macroscopic and microscopic scores than the other groups (p &lt; 0.05).

However, sequence analysis of a single genomic locus cannot provide sufficient resolution for the genetic diversity of the Fasciola parasite whose genomes are &#8764;1.3 GB in size.</Abstract><Abstract>To gain a better understanding of the gene diversity of Fasciola isolates from western Iran and to identify the most informative markers as candidates for epidemiological studies, five housekeeping genes were evaluated using a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach.</Abstract><Abstract>MLST analysis was developed based on five genes (ND1, Pepck, Pold, Cyt b and HSP70) after genomic DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing. Nucleotide diversity and phylogeny analysis were conducted on both concatenated MLST loci and each individual locus. A median joining haplotype network was created to examine the haplotypes relationship among Fasciola isolates.</Abstract><Abstract>Thirty-three Fasciola isolates (19 F. hepatica and 14 F. gigantica) were included in the study. A total of 2971&#160;bp was analysed for each isolate and 31 sequence types (STs) were identified among the 33 isolates (19 for F. hepatica and 14 for F. gigantica isolates). The STs produced 44 and 42 polymorphic sites and 17 and 14 haplotypes for F. hepatica and F. gigantica, respectively. Haplotype diversity was 0.982 &#177; 0.026 and 1.000 &#177; 0.027 and nucleotide diversity was 0.00200 and 0.00353 &#177; 0.00088 for F. hepatica and F. gigantica, respectively. There was a high degree of genetic diversity with a Simpson's index of diversity of 0.98 and 1 for F. hepatica and F. gigantica, respectively. While HSP70 and Pold haplotypes from Fasciola species were separated by one to three mutational steps, the haplotype networks of ND1 and Cyt b were more complex and numerous mutational steps were found, likely due to recombination.</Abstract><Abstract>Although HSP70 and Pold genes from F. gigantica were invariant over the entire region of sequence coverage, MLST was useful for investigating the phylogenetic relationship of Fasciola species.

Since cats can act as vectors, carriers, reservoirs and definitive hosts of many gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, parasitic assessment could contribute to their survival and well-being.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study aimed to assess the diversity and prevalence of GI parasites in domestic and feral cats from Ratnanagar in Chitwan in Central Nepal.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 107 fresh faecal samples of cats (90 household cats and 17 feral cats) of varied ages and sex were collected and transported to the laboratory. The copromicroscopic examination was carried out following direct wet mount, formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation, saturated salt flotation, acid-fast staining and sporulation techniques. Furthermore, associated risk factors were evaluated to ascertain the predictor of risks for parasitic acquisition.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study revealed an overall 95.3% prevalence rate with a 100% rate in feral cats and 94.4% in household cats. Altogether, 18 (17 known and one unknown) different species of GI parasites were reported with the helminths (95.3%; 11 species) and the protozoa (55.1%; seven species). Besides age and sex, outdoor lifestyle, absence or unknown history of medication and hunting behaviour of the felines are the predictors of risk. Furthermore, mixed infection was comparatively higher than single infection in the faecal samples.</Abstract><Abstract>Cats harbour a higher prevalence and greater diversity of GI parasites, and parasitism varies with age and sex. This finding can be essential for veterinarians and public health authorities for strategic treatment and for assessing the zoonotic transmission of the parasites from these felines.

Study animals (403 sheep and goats) older than 5 months were selected with a systematic random sampling approach. From the animals, blood samples were aseptically collected and PPRV antibodies from the serum were analysed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</Abstract><Abstract>The overall seroprevalence of antibodies to PPRV was 32.5% in both species. It was higher in goats with a prevalence of 34.7% than in sheep (28.3%). District, herd size, sex, animal origin and grazing management were significantly associated with seropositivity of animals to PPRV antibodies. If an animal was from the Dangur district, it had 2.6 times higher chance of being positive than in the Dibati district (OR = 2.6, p = 0.01 and 95% CI = 1.2- 5.6). Herd size was also significantly correlated with the seropositivity with (OR = 4, p = 0.001, and 95% CI = 1.8-9). Also, male animals had 1.7 times higher chance of being positive than females. Further, if an animal comes from the market, it has 2.7 times higher chance of being positive compared to animals born and raised on the farm.</Abstract><Abstract>The seropositivity indicates that the disease is circulating in the study areas.

A cross-sectional study followed by a simple random sampling technique was used to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis (Rose Bengal plate test; RBPT and complement fixation test; CFT) in small ruminants and its related risk variables from November 2019 to June 2020 in Kolme and Abala Abaya districts. A questionnaire was also given to owners to assess their existing knowledge of the disease.</Abstract><Abstract>Using the RBPT and CFT, 28 (4.1%) and 23 (3.33%) of the 690 animals were found to be seropositive for brucellosis, respectively. In this study, the seroprevalence of brucellosis detected in the Kolme district (5.3%) was greater when compared to Abala Abaya (1.0%). The odds of Brucella infection were greater for goats (odds ratio [OR] 6.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 16 0.8-44.9) than for sheep. The odds of adult animals (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07) being positive for brucellosis was higher than young animals. A statistically significant difference in the seropositivity of brucellosis was detected in univariate logistic regression among districts, different age groups, herd size, parity number, and reproductive health problems except for species and sex, but in multivariate logistic regression, only reproductive health problems were revealed a statistically significant difference. Out of 138 families, 100% of respondents were unaware of brucellosis, 94.5% drink raw milk, and 74% handle animals with retained fetal membranes with their bare hands.</Abstract><Abstract>This study showed that brucellosis was a widely spread disease in the study areas and poses a substantial public health danger.

Heavier calf birth weight resulted in high risk of severe ketosis (p &lt; 0.01), due to increased milk yield during the early lactation.</Abstract><Abstract>The severity of ketosis is associated with the calving season, BCS at parturition, age, lactation number, calving interval, milk yield in the early lactation period, and calf birth weight. Nonetheless, it was not associated with the method of reproduction, parturition time, pregnancy wastage, premature delivery, retained placenta, and type of calf. This study is the first to investigate the associations between ketosis and calf birth weight. Our findings could help predict cows at risk of ketosis and take precautions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placenta, Retained</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birth Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postpartum Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ketosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

No neurological abnormalities were observed on preoperative physical examination. Surgery was completed uneventfully under fentanyl- and sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. Cardiorespiratory indices remained stable under mechanical ventilation throughout the procedure. Approximately 23 min after the discontinuation of fentanyl infusion, the investigator noticed jaw closure and stiffness and thoraco-abdominal muscle rigidity. To rule out fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity, naloxone was administered. Following administration of naloxone, there was a return of spontaneous respiratory effort, indicated by capnogram and visible chest wall excursion. Based on the clinical signs and response to naloxone administration, the dog was diagnosed with suspected fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity. Six minutes after the return of spontaneous respiration, the dog was extubated uneventfully without additional naloxone administration. During 4 days of postoperative hospitalization, no recurrent muscle rigidity was observed, and the patient was discharged safely. The total dose of fentanyl administered was 0.61 mg (27 &#956;g kg[-1]).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fentanyl</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Analgesics, Opioid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration, Artificial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscle Rigidity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Naloxone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Abdominal Muscles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Gene expression pattern analysis showed that there were significant differences between the low-temperature treatment groups and the control group, and there were also differences between individuals after long-term low-temperature treatment. Analysis of DEGs revealed that 134 pathways were significantly enriched in the cold adaptation group, 98 pathways were significantly enriched in the acute cold stress group, and 71 pathways were shared between the two groups. The 71 shared pathways were mainly related to lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism; signal transduction; endocrine, immune, and nervous system; cardiovascular disease; infectious diseases caused by bacteria or viruses; and neurodegenerative disease.</Abstract><Abstract>In conclusion, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of porcine skeletal muscle response under low-temperature environment. The data may assist further research on the mechanism of pig response to cold exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Transcriptome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurodegenerative Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gene Expression Profiling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscle, Skeletal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Supplementation on production performance, egg quality traits, and biochemical parameters of blood and egg in laying hens at later stages of the production period.</Title>	<Abstract>According to the promising outcomes acquired in recent studies that focused on using natural feed additives in animal nutrition, poultry nutritionists have also been interested in investigating these medicinal herbs' effects on poultry performance and egg characteristics. Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.), a natural source of antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, etc. compounds, is recommended as a potential alternative for antibiotics, with similar benefits and no adverse effects on animal health or their products. Considerable effects have been reported on laying hens' performance and their eggs' internal and external traits by pennyroyal inclusion in their diets.</Abstract><Abstract>Due to the different results reported by pennyroyal inclusion in laying hens' diets in recent limited studies, this study was designed to reinvestigate the impacts of pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.) supplementation (PS) on productive performance, egg quality traits, and biochemical compounds in blood and egg yolk in aged laying hens. The findings of this experiment may help for a better understanding of PS impacts on desired parameters, along with improving aged laying hens' performance.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 144 Leghorn (Hyline-W36 strain) laying hens (53 weeks old) were used to investigate the effects of PS on performance, egg quality, and biochemical parameters of blood and egg yolk in old laying hens. The animals were distributed into three treatment groups; including a control diet (without PS), 0.5%, and 1% PS diets with six replicates and eight birds per replicate.</Abstract><Abstract>The results indicated that the egg production rate (except for week eight) and egg mass were significantly reduced by PS in the laying hens' diet during the first four weeks and the total period of the experiment (P&lt;0.05). However, the feed conversion ratio increased by PS (P&lt;0.05). Based on the egg quality trait evaluations (week 4), the yolk percentage, yolk height, and yolk index reduced, while shell-breaking strength represented a significant increase in PS groups (P&lt;0.05). However, shell thickness and albumen percentage reduced and increased by 1% PS, respectively (P&lt;0.05). At week eight, the Haugh unit reduced while the albumen pH increased by PS (P&lt;0.05). The findings revealed a decline in the egg density in 1% PS groups (P&lt;0.05). In the case of serum biochemical parameters, alanine aminotransferase increased, whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduced in the PS groups (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the triglyceride levels of both serum and egg yolk (accompanied by the very low-density lipoprotein level of serum) decreased by PS (P&lt;0.05).</Abstract><Abstract>In conclusion, PS reduced serum and egg yolk triglyceride levels, accompanied by serum MDA, along with reducing production performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mentha pulegium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triglycerides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>36495211</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Markers for internal neoplasia in the horse.</Title>	<Abstract>The diagnosis of internal neoplasia in horses is challenging. Increased production of hormones physiologic for adult animals (e.g., adrenocorticotropin, norepinephrine, and erythropoietin) or typical for the foetal phase (alpha-fetoprotein, anti-M&#252;llerian hormone, and parathyroid-hormone-related protein) might aid in tumour diagnostics. Thymidine kinase-1 and alkaline phosphatase are examples of intracellular enzymes, whose activity in the blood may increase in some neoplasia cases. Furthermore, inappropriate production of abnormal monoclonal or autologous antibodies can accompany lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Many of those tumour markers lead to clinical or laboratory changes, called paraneoplastic syndromes, such as hypercalcaemia and erythrocytosis. The interpretation of the results of the tumour marker measurements in horses is complicated due to many factors affecting the markers' concentration or activity (e.g., young age, pregnancy, and inflammation) and other diseases triggering the same changes. Moreover, the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes is inconsistent, which leads to low sensitivity of those substances as tumour markers. In conclusion, screening for neoplasia in horses is not recommended. The measurement of tumour markers should be performed only in risk groups with suspicious clinical or laboratory findings, and the results should be interpreted with caution. It is advisable to add inflammatory markers to the tumour profile or repeat the measurements.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paraneoplastic Syndromes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers, Tumor</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Lesions were characterised by 4 blinded observers, all of whom are diplomates in equine internal medicine, using established descriptors from the ECEIM consensus statement and subjective severity. Treatment outcome was ranked as worsened, improved or healed. Consensus lesion type, lesion severity and treatment choice were compared to outcome and data screened using univariate analysis (chi-squared) to determine whether each predicted outcome. Lesion types where univariate analysis predicted a trend (p&lt;0.2) were included in a multiple-regression analysis to identify predictors of outcome irrespective of treatment.</Abstract><Abstract>Only severity significantly predicted final outcome (p = 0.025) with severe lesions being more likely to improve. Treatment choice did not significantly predict outcome. Overall healing rate was 29% (24 horses), and 43% (44 horses) improved.

The growth traits in this study were birth weight, 3-month weight, 6-month weight, 9-month weight and yearling weight.</Abstract><Abstract>The combined direct heritability was the lowest for birth weight (0.190 &#177; 0.004, 0.198 &#177; 0.003 and 0.196 &#177; 0.004 for M, W and D breeds, respectively) and the highest for yearling weight (0.264 &#177; 0.010, 0.304 &#177; 0.005 and 0.285 &#177; 0.020 for M, W and D breeds, respectively). The maternal heritability was the lowest for yearling weight (0.085 &#177; 0.003, 0.055 &#177; 0.002 and 0.052 &#177; 0.005 for M, W and D breeds, respectively) and the highest for 6-month weight (0.240 &#177; 0.088, 0.164 &#177; 0.001 and 0.162 &#177; 0.006 for M, W and D breeds, respectively). The phenotypic and genetic correlations were lower between the weights measured at more distant intervals. The lowest genetic correlation was observed between birth weight and yearling weight (0.290 &#177; 0.051 for W breeds).</Abstract><Abstract>The small standard errors could indicate that the aggregation of results from different studies improved the reliability of estimated parameters and reduced range of 95% confidence intervals. Hence, the results could be used with greater level of confidence in sheep breeding programmes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wool</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Birth Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenotype</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>36516307</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Survey of wild boar hunter interactions with pig farming in central Europe.</Title>	<Abstract>African swine fever (ASF) is a fatal animal disease without zoonotic potential but greatly impacts human well-being, especially in the most vulnerable human communities. In Europe, ASF concerns mostly the wildlife domain of health. The main vector of the disease is confirmed to be the wild boar, though long-distance jumps of the infection are due to anthropogenic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the potential role of hunting assistant personnel (beaters and carcass handlers) in ASF spread in Hungary. Based on a personal interview survey, we attempted to identify the epidemiological risk caused by hunting activities and the hunting personnel. The interviews with 58 hunting workers confirmed that an extent backyard pig sector (13 pig farmers) and pork production system (31 pork producers) existed within the study region out of the authorities' sight. Two pig farmers did not wear special working clothes for pig caring, seven pork producers disposed of slaughter offal in the settlements periphery, and six persons regularly contacted distant pig farms. The revealed knowledge, attitude, and practice of the questioned pig farmers suggested that this sector would be very vulnerable in an epidemic situation; moreover, backyard farms would cause a great risk for wildboar populations. Considering that the study region is the third poorest region of Hungary, these findings called attention to the high epidemiologic risk of socioeconomic inequality between different regions within the European Union.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>African Swine Fever Virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Europe</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sus scrofa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Apoptotic analysis was also performed using western blotting and flow cytometry.</Abstract><Abstract>In ncp BVDV2-infected MDBK cells, more autophagosomes were observed by TEM, and the number of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) with green fluorescent protein puncta was also increased. The ncp BVDV2-infected cells showed significantly enhanced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, as well as upregulation of autophagy-related proteins, including ATG5 and Beclin 1, and substantial degradation of p62/SQSTM1. These results are similar to those induced by rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. E2 protein expression, which is associated with viral replication, increased over time in ncp BVDV2-infected cells. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA in ncp BVDV2-infected MDBK cells downregulated the expressions of LC3-II, ATG5 and Beclin 1 and prevented the degradation of p62/SQSTM1. Moreover, the expressions of phosphorylated Akt and procaspase-3 were significantly increased in ncp BVDV2-infected cells.

Identification and detection of parasite species using precise methods including molecular methods can be an effective step in treating and controlling parasites.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among breeding calves of Khorramabad city, Lorestan province, Western Iran, using PCR.</Abstract><Abstract>The faecal samples were taken from 181 healthy and diarrhoeal calves and after the Ziehl Neelsen Acid-fast staining and microscopic evaluation, the genomic DNA was extracted for molecular evaluations. To detect Cryptosporidium species, specific primers targeting the SAM-1 gene of Cryptosporidium and a commercial master mix were used for PCR.</Abstract><Abstract>Out of 181 faecal samples of breeding calves in Khorramabad city, 9 samples (5%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. using the PCR method. Statistical analysis of the data showed that there was no significant statistical relationship between Cryptosporidium infection of the calves and variables of age, breed, type of water consumption, clinical signs of diarrhoea, and sampling location, while parasite infection had a significant relationship with calf gender so that all Cryptosporidium positive samples were from male calves (p &#8804; 0.05).</Abstract><Abstract>Considering the presence of Cryptosporidium infection, the region's traditional grazing system, and the close relationship between livestock and humans, there is a possibility of human infection in the region. So preventive measures such as periodic animal testing with sensitive and accurate diagnostic techniques including PCR, pharmacological treatment of livestock, water hygiene and the use of industrial grazing instead of traditional grazing to improve the hygiene of food consumed by livestock are recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryptosporidiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryptosporidium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iran</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diarrhea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The dog was diagnosed with sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis a year prior and was treated with tamoxifen, an oestrogen receptor antagonist, for treatment of the disease. The dog developed a swollen vulva with vulvar discharge and a stump pyometra was diagnosed on ultrasound. Hormonal testing was submitted to evaluate for an ovarian remnant and the dog underwent an exploratory laparotomy, where the uterine stump was removed. No ovarian remnant tissue was identified intra-operatively, and hormonal testing (anti-M&#252;llerian hormone, progesterone, oestradiol) and histopathology were consistent with the absence of ovarian tissue.

Early use of an incline during UWTM exercise may have the potential to improve rehabilitation outcomes in dogs, but, it is hypothesised that dorsoventral movement of the spine may be excessive meaning it is unsuitable in some circumstances.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was to identify changes in canine spinal kinematics in dogs when using a dry treadmill at different angles of incline compared to an underwater treadmill using the same inclines.</Abstract><Abstract>Eight dogs were encouraged to walk on a dry, horizontal, underwater treadmill as well as under the same conditions with both a 10% and 20% incline. This was then repeated at a 10% and 20% incline with the addition of water to hock level. Data were collected using reflective anatomical markers placed at the occipital protuberance, T1, T13, L3, L7 and sacral apex, captured by a high-speed camera facing the lateral aspect of the treadmill. Dorsoventral motion of the spine as well as flexion, extension and range of motion (ROM) of T1, T13, L3 and L7 were recorded.</Abstract><Abstract>We found significant differences in dorsoventral spinal ROM at T1, L3 and L7, but no significant differences in T13 ROM.

However, based on increasing evidence, male animals experience significant pain after castration. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), one of the main bioactive components in A. membranaceus bunge, has been widely used as part of Fu-Zheng therapy to enhance natural defense mechanisms.</Abstract><Abstract>This study was carried out to determine the effects of supplementing different doses of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS; control, 0&#160;mg/kg; APSL, 400&#160;mg/kg; and APSH, 800&#160;mg/kg) for 8 weeks on the haematology and serum chemistry profiles, immune response, and oxidative stress status in weanling beagle dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>After adapting to the experimental environment for 1 week, 18 male beagle dogs (Sichuan Institute of Musk Deer Breeding, China; average initial weight, 3.80&#160;&#177; 0.43&#160;g; age, 3-month-old) were randomly allotted to diets supplemented with three doses of APS (Control, 0&#160;mg/kg; low, 400&#160;mg/kg; and high, 800&#160;mg/kg), referred to as control, APSL, and APSH, respectively; six dogs were assigned to each treatment. The dogs were fed the respective diets twice daily at 08:30 and 16:30&#160;h in sufficient quantity to supply the metabolizable energy requirements for 8 weeks. On day 43 (19 weeks old), the dogs were castrated. On days 42 (prior to castration, 19 weeks old), 50 (day 7 after castration, 20 weeks old), and 57 (day 14 after castration, 21 weeks old) to measure the haematology, blood chemistry, immune response, and oxidative stress status parameters.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on our findings, the APSH diet decreased weight gain and increased the feed to gain ratio in dogs (P &lt; 0.05). At 14 days after castration, the wound was almost closed, slightly swollen, dry, and clean in the groups supplemented with APS. In addition, optimal APS supplementation was found to decrease erythrocyte count (RBC), haematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) levels, and cortisol and protein carbonyl (PC) concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and platelet (PLT) levels, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and glutathione (GSH) content, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) activities were increased in the APS supplemented groups (P &lt; 0.05) CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that supplementing weanling beagle dogs with optimum APS could positively affect wound healing by improving their haematological profile (decreased RBC and HCT content, increased MCH and PLT levels), serum biochemical parameters (decreased ALP and ALT content), immune status (decreased CRP, IL-1&#946;, and TNF-&#945; levels; increased IL-10 content), and antioxidant defense (decreased cortisol and PC content; increased GSH content, and SOD1, CAT, and Se-GPx activities). However, the detailed mechanism whereby APS regulates these changes requires further investigation. In addition, the results of this study suggest that 400&#160;mg/kg diet is the optimum APS dose for beagle dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Castration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deer</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glutathione</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Interleukin-10</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxidative Stress</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polysaccharides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Superoxide Dismutase-1</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although several Brucella vaccines have been demonstrated for use in animals, Brucella spp. can cause human infection and to date, there are no human-use vaccines licensed by any agency. Recently, methods in vaccine informatics have made major breakthroughs in peptide-based epitopes, opening up a new avenue of vaccine development.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this article was to identify potential antigenic peptides in Brucella by proteome and peptidome analyses.</Abstract><Abstract>Mouse infection models were first established by injection with Brucella and spleen protein profiles were then analysed. Subsequently, the major histocompatibility complex class I or II (major histocompatibility complex [MHC]-I/II)-binding peptides in blood samples were collected by immunoprecipitation and peptides derived from Brucella proteins were identified through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These peptides were then evaluated in a variety of ways, such as in terms of conservation in Brucella and synchronicity in predicted peptides (similarity and coverage), which allowed us to more effectively measure their antigenic potential.</Abstract><Abstract>The expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IFN-&#947; was significantly altered in the spleen of infected mice and some Brucella proteins, such as Muri, AcpP and GroES, were also detected. Meanwhile, in blood, 35 peptides were identified and most showed high conservation, highlighting their potential as antigen epitopes for vaccine development. In particular, we identified four proteins containing both MHC-I- and MHC-II-binding peptides including AtpA, AtpD, DnaK and BAbS19_II02030. They were also compared with the predicted peptides to estimate their reliability.</Abstract><Abstract>The peptides we screened could bind to MHC molecules. After being stimulated with antigen T epitopes, Memory T cells can stimulate T cell activation and promote immune responses. Our results indicated that the peptides we identified may be good candidate targets for the design of subunit vaccines and these results pave the way for the study of safer vaccines against Brucella.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brucella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chromatography, Liquid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tandem Mass Spectrometry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epitopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peptides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Despite their significance, little scientific attention has been given to these problems. Although there are several reviews on cryptorchidism in dogs, none have described anorchia. Testicular agenesis is a rare reproductive disorder with a congenital origin. Moreover, no author has described the diagnostic procedure for making a definitive diagnosis of anorchia in dogs. It is important to have a well-structured diagnostic scheme to help practical veterinarians make a confirmatory diagnosis. This review article aims to provide an update on canine anorchia diagnosis based on the poor research studies published in recent years. We have also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disorder using human medicine studies.

However, MDA decreases with age. The most important and effective factor on immunization is timely vaccination. But in recent years, there were some outbreaks of CDV among puppies in Iran and this problem could be related to vaccine failure.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible effect of MDA titre on vaccines against CDV and the efficacy of two commercial vaccines by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</Abstract><Abstract>In this regard, 24 healthy 8-week old terrier puppies were selected and divided into three identical groups based on a randomized, double-blind comparative trial. The control group was injected normal saline, and group A was vaccinated by the vaccine namely Biocan L (Bioveta, Czech Republic), and the group B was vaccinated by the other vaccine called Duramune Max 5 + LCI/GP (Fort Dodge Animal Health, USA). The vaccines were used for the puppies between 8 and 16 weeks of age and in every 4 weeks.</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed that the response of both vaccines was satisfactory, and no significant difference was observed between them. Moreover, the MDA in the control group reached an unprotective level in all puppies prior to their 14 weeks of age. In the vaccinated groups, after the second vaccine, all puppies in both groups reached protective levels.</Abstract><Abstract>This is the first study on evaluation of two commercial vaccines in changes of serum antibody titres against distemper in puppies in Iran.</Abstract><Abstract>It is recommended that veterinarians during consulting use the ELISA to measure antibody titres to optimize the vaccination schedule and reduce the cost of vaccination failure.

Animals in zoos are potentially an important source of TB for humans; however they are often neglected in routine disease surveillance programs. This investigation reports an outbreak of TB in milu deer and northern pig-tailed macaques in a zoo in Wuhan, China, which highlighted the need for improved prevention and control of TB in China.</Abstract><Abstract>Between 24 November and 9 December 2020 two milu deer and a northern pig-tailed macaque that were displaying signs of wasting died. Post-mortem, histopathological diagnosis and acid fast staining were used for the dead animals. Multiple PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was performed to identify the bacterial in both milu deer and northern pig-tailed macaque. The serum antibody iELISA for MTBC was then performed for all the surviving milu deer and northern pig-tailed macaques. Six seropositive milu deer and a seropositive northern pig-tailed macaque were subsequently euthanised and, along with two other dead milu deer, necropsied. DNA from these tissue samples was extracted and detected MTBC using PCR and Real-time PCR. Subsequently bacterial isolation was used to confirm the infection.</Abstract><Abstract>The lungs of the dead animals displayed gross and histological TB-like lesions and changes, and red staining bacilli were detected in smears of the lesions by microscopy after acid fast staining. Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) was detected in the two milu deer and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) in the northern pig-tailed macaque using multiple PCR for MTBC. 35.3% surviving milu deer and 50% surviving northern pig-tailed macaques MTBC serologically positive. Six of the euthanised milu deer were also positive on a DNA test for M. bovis and the euthanised northern pig-tailed macaque was positive to M. tb.</Abstract><Abstract>This is the first report of tuberculosis in the endangered species, milu deer and northern pig-tailed macaques, in China, and warrants urgent attention by researchers and conservation authorities.

Analyses of infections among carnivorous falcons have not previously been reported. Fifty juvenile captive falcons (Falco spp.) with or without Lawsonia infection were investigated in the United Arab Emirates, including clinical laboratory methods. Fresh intestinal biopsy samples were analysed by microbiological techniques for Lawsonia and other bacteria and by standard parasitological and pathological methods. Lawsonia intracellularis infection was diagnosed by microbiological examination and qPCR in 10 of 50 juvenile falcons at case examination. Seven of these 10 falcons were of normal clinical appearance, and the other three had other contributing factors to ill-thrift. A range of other conditions were noted in 40 case control falcons. This first report of Lawsonia infection in falcons suggests that the agent may have a limited contribution to clinical disease in these birds, including ill-thrift syndromes.

The dog presented with acute pain, inflammation and grade IV lameness in the right hind paw. A complete transverse fracture in the right proximal tibia was diagnosed from radiography. The dog underwent a minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) procedure. After surgery, photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) was applied twice daily for 21 days. A multi-wavelength PBMT-sMF device was applied at three sites using different frequencies: proximal and distal of the fracture zone (3000 Hz, 40.35 J per site, and 300 s per site) and in the fracture zone (250 Hz, 39.11 J and 300 s per site). Follow up radiographies were performed after surgery and treatment with PBMT-sMF. Eighteen days post-surgery the healing process of bone was advanced. Fifty-five days post-surgery the callus was enlarged. In addition, radiographic union and clinical union was evidenced by closure of the fracture gap.

<Rec><Common><PMID>36645879</PMID>	<Type>Letter</Type>	<Title>Epidemic of lumpy skin disease in Pakistan.</Title>	<Abstract>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease that affects farm animals including water buffalo. It is caused by the contagious LSD virus, a member of the Poxiviridae family's Capripox genus. Skin sores are thought to be the most common site of infection since the virus may live for lengthy periods in lesions or scabs. The first clinical indications of LSD were described in Zambia, in 1929. Pakistan has also been afflicted by LSD, with a high number of animals infected at many cattle ranches in Karachi, 190,000 cases of LSD have been reported nationwide, with greater than 7500 deaths attributable to the illness. LSD has a huge influence on Pakistan's economic status, resulting in the loss of cattle and a decrease in milk output. The Ministry of Research and National Food Safety in Pakistan has formed a working group to create a framework for controlling the spread of LSD in cattle and buffalo. Official and private veterinarians, both field and slaughterhouse, veterinary students, farmers, cattle merchants, cattle truck drivers, and artificial inseminators should all participate in awareness efforts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumpy Skin Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pakistan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumpy skin disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Buffaloes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sex determination of the flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) in the culture system and spawn-producing and fish reproduction system is very important. Currently, there are several methods to determine the sex of fish; however, they are time-consuming, expensive and sometimes dangerous for the fish.</Abstract><Abstract>The purpose of this study was the sex determination of flathead grey mullet by ultrasonography as a safe and accurate method.</Abstract><Abstract>In this regard, 30 flathead grey mullets (early in their maturation) from a farm in Gomishan-Golestan province, Iran were examined using a portable ultrasound machine with a 6-12&#160;MHz waterproof linear transducer. Scanning was performed on the ventral body surface in the sagittal and transverse planes, between ventral and anal fins.</Abstract><Abstract>Differences in shape, qualitative size, echogenicity and the wall layers of the ovary and testis were evaluated for sex determination. Results of ultrasonography were confirmed immediately at necropsy. Ultrasonographic accuracy for sex determination was 100%. The speed of the procedure was around 30&#160;s per fish.</Abstract><Abstract>Overall, the sex determination of flathead grey mullet by ultrasonography was high in accuracy and speed, non-invasive and safe for fish and consumers, and may be considered a priority.

<Rec><Common><PMID>36723508</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Otitis media with effusion in two Boston terrier dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Otitis media (OM) in dogs can occur as a primary condition instead of as an extension of an otitis externa (OE), characterized by the presence of fluid in the middle ear (ME) referred to as OM with effusion (OME). OME has been reported in a brachycephalic breed (boxer), and the same condition is described as primary secretory OM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These dogs can be asymptomatic or present with pain, facial nerve paralysis and reduced hearing. This report describes two cases of OME with associated neurologic signs in Boston terriers with no previous history of OE, normal external ear canals and tympanic membranes. Neurologic evaluation revealed right head tilt along with vestibular ataxia and frequent walking tight circles to the right in case 1, and a dull mentation with a right-sided head tilt and torticollis, vestibular tetra-ataxia, ambulatory tetraparesis and circling to the right in case 2. MRI imaging of the brain was performed. Results showed bilateral OM with right-sided otitis interna and equivocal associated otogenic meningitis in case 1 and right-sided OM in case 2. Myringotomy was performed, and both dogs' ME sampled for cytology that only revealed inflammatory cells; and bacterial cultures which revealed a light growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 1. ME were flushed with sterile saline. Oral glucocorticoids and antibiotics based on the susceptibility results, and a compound antibiotic and glucocorticoid ear solution were prescribed to case 1. Neurologic improvement was observed a few days after the appointment, but a mild right-sided head tilt remained evident. Owner of case two elected humane euthanasia due to patient respiratory difficulties upon anaesthetic recovery and other concurrent healthy concerns. Current findings reinforce that brachycephalic dogs may be prone to develop OME, and advanced imaging tests are key to the diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media with Effusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ataxia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ascaris suum and Toxocara vitulorum have been recovered from the liver of swine and buffalo. We necropsied a Persian Kurdish filly at age 6 months, weighing &#8764;100 kg. Death evidently was caused by oleander (Nerium oleander) intoxication. An 8-cm adult male Parascaris was found at the lobar-left hepatic bile duct junction. We suggest that the nematode entered anteriorly into the hepatic tree, via the duodenum, major duodenal papilla, bile duct, left hepatic duct and finally the lobar duct. Considering the brief 4-h elapsed time between death and necropsy, and the 18-cm distance from the major duodenal papilla to the location of the parasite, we conclude that entry into the biliary tree likely occurred ante-mortem.

Animals in these enclosures are also crucial for the education, research, and conservation aspect. To ensure better management and good health of wild animals in captivity, it is essential to monitor the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic (helminths and protozoa) infections. The current investigation was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of GI parasitic infections in wild mammals at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib (BSM) safari park and Chattogram (CTG) zoo of Bangladesh. A total of 72 individual faecal samples were collected from 25 species of wild mammals. Routine qualitative (e.g. direct smear, sedimentation, and flotation) and quantitative (e.g. McMaster technique) tests were performed to identify the eggs or oocysts of helminths and protozoa. Results demonstrated that wild mammals of both BSM safari park and CTG zoo were infected with a total of 17 genera/species of helminths and protozoa. The overall prevalence of GI parasitic infections in wild mammals of both zoological parks was 65.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.14-76.12), whereas it was 72.4% (95% CI: 52.76-87.27) in the BSM safari park and 60.5% (95% CI: 44.41-75.02) in the CTG zoo. In both zoological parks, infection with nematodes was more frequent compared to other helminth into the wild mammals. The herbivores were more infected with GI parasites than carnivores and omnivores of both BSM safari park and CTG zoo. The mean eggs/oocysts per gram of faeces was the highest in the carnivores compared to herbivores and omnivores of both enclosures. The findings of the current study demonstrated that wild mammals of both BSM safari park and CTG zoo suffered from various GI parasitic infections. Regular monitoring along with proper therapeutic measures may reduce the severe consequences of GI parasitic infections in captive wild animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bangladesh</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Helminths</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Wild</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dog 1 was transferred to hospital from a local hospital in a haemorrhagic shock state with uncontrolled continuous bleeding. Thoracic radiographs revealed multiple nodular shadows suspected to be pulmonary metastasis. Dog 2 presented with intermittent bleeding from a mass lesion in the right fifth mammary gland. Due to high anaesthetic risk secondary to severe mitral valve insufficiency (ASA status III), the owner declined surgical excision of the tumour. Therefore, microwave ablation (MWA) under local anaesthesia was chosen in order to achieve adequate haemostasis. Both dogs received local anaesthesia around the bleeding mass lesion, and the disintegrated site was microwave-ablated; dog 1 underwent MWA after blood transfusion to improve the haemorrhagic shock. The ablation site was protected using a non-adhesive dressing. Scarring of the ulcerated site led to complete haemostasis in both cases. Dog 1 underwent tumorectomy on the 31st hospital day to prevent rebleeding; histopathology results were consistent with mammary adenocarcinoma with the ablation site covered by a capsule structure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report describing the use of MWA to stop bleeding from mammary tumours in veterinary medicine. MWA is a feasible and potentially effective palliative treatment modality to stop bleeding from disintegrated mammary tumours in dogs under local anaesthesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Shock, Hemorrhagic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microwaves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiofrequency Ablation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eighteen months after partial maxillectomy, neoplastic masses were detected in both kidneys on computed tomography. The dog died 12 months after detection of bilateral kidney neoplasms. The resected neoplastic masses were routinely processed for histopathological observation and immunohistochemistry against pan-cytokeratin, desmin, CD3, and MUM-1.</Abstract><Abstract>The recurred mass mainly consisted of well-differentiated plasma cells and contained a small portion of aggressive cells with malignant features. Monoclonal gammopathy was not observed on serumelectrophoresis performed to exclude multiple myeloma. The mass was composed of plasma cells with high nuclear pleomorphism and abundant mitotic figures. The neoplasm stained positive for MUM-1 with a more aggressive morphology than in oral EMP.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on serum biomarker and pathological observations, a diagnosis of recurrence and metastasis of oral-to-renal EMP was established.

Compared to the control group, the addition of ZnCl2 significantly increased total antioxidative capacity and CuZn superoxide dismutase activity, while reducing the malondialdehyde content (p &lt; 0.05). ZnCl2 at 100 and 200&#160;&#956;g/mL significantly decreased sperm motility, protein kinase A (PKA) substrate phosphorylation, and tyrosine phosphorylation. These proteins were mainly located on the mid-pieces of the flagellum. The addition of ZnCl2 at 20 and 50&#160;&#956;g/mL conveyed a protective effect to boar sperm stored at 17&#176;C. Furthermore, ZnCl2 at 100 and 200&#160;&#956;g/mL inhibited sperm motility via tyrosine phosphorylation, thus preventing the 'capacitation-like' state. In the capacitated state, there was no change in PKA substrate phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the mid-pieces of the flagellum compared to the control groups, indicating that the addition of Zn[2+] did not negatively affect capacitation of preserved sperm.</Abstract><Abstract>ZnCl2 showed protective capacity to the preservation extender used for boar sperm during the process of 17&#176;C storage, and the optimal concentration of ZnCl2 for the preservation extender was 100&#160;&#956;g/mL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sperm Motility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Semen Preservation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spermatozoa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antioxidants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tyrosine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

TVM and ivermectin were administered at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg body weight through a single subcutaneous injection route followed by plasma collectiom and analysis at different time intervals. Plasma concentrations of TVM and IVM were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. Pharmacokinetic analysis was completed using the non-compartmental method with WinNonlin&#8482; 6.4 software. TVM is rapidly absorbed after administration with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax , 9.78 &#177; 2.34 ng/ml) obtained within 6-22 h. AUC0-last was 586.86 h&#183;ng/ml &#177; 121.24 h&#183;ng/ml. The mean elimination half-life of TVM (T1/2&#955;z) was 97.99 h &#177; 46.41 h. The T1/2&#955;z of IVM was 146.59 h &#177; 22.26 h in the study. The present study showed that subcutaneous administration of TVM at 0.3 mg/kg body weight (BW) in swine is absorbed more rapidly than IVM in swine. Compared to the pharmacokinetic characteristics of IVM, there was little difference in the half-life of TVM among different individuals. The data will contribute to refining the formulation and dosage regime for TVM administration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ivermectin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antiparasitic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Area Under Curve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Questions addressed career history, previous use, and personal perceptions of the use of paracetamol in dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 450 veterinarians were included in the survey; 96% (n = 431) of whom worked in small animal practice only. The majority reported a frequency of use of 1-3 times a week (n = 197), with oral dosing being the most common route of administration (n = 440). Only 8 had never prescribed paracetamol. Paracetamol was more commonly used to provide analgesia (n = 431) than for the treatment of pyrexia (n = 292) and was predominantly used as an alternative to NSAIDs (n = 408) or as part of multimodal analgesia (n = 406). Hepatotoxic (n = 311) and gastrointestinal (n = 120) side effects were a common concern, although the majority perceived a low risk of side effects and felt they were likely to be mild if they did occur (n = 279).

Between January and May 2022, 543 households and 27 animal health practitioners (AHP) were visited in 4 provinces of the West Kazakhstan region to assess their KAPs towards FMD.</Abstract><Abstract>A large proportion of herd owners (84%) had known the name of the disease, and nearly a half (48) of respondents had heard of FMD cases on farms in the neighbourhood. Oral mucosa lesions were the most consistent with clinical sign characteristic of FMD among farmers (31.4%), followed by hoof blisters (27.6%) and excessive salivation (18.6%). Farmers reported that new animal introduction was potentially the main factor associated with FMD occurrence in their herds. Over half of farmers (54%) interviewed prefer not to purchase livestock from unknown or potentially epidemiologically disadvantaged areas.</Abstract><Abstract>All AHPs (27) reported that in their zone of veterinary responsibilities, vaccination against FMD is not practised because the area investigated possesses FMD-free status. However, in the past few years, numerous FMD outbreaks have been detected throughout the region. For this reason, immediate actions need to be taken to prevent further FMD occurrences by giving the region a status of an FMD-free zone with vaccination. The current study demonstrated that inadequate quarantine controls of imported animals, absence of regular vaccination and unrestricted animal movement within the country were the primary obstacles in controlling and preventing FMD in the investigated area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot-and-Mouth Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Farmers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kazakhstan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Livestock</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A gastrotomy was therefore performed, and long paean forceps were gently and blindly inserted into the cardia of the stomach. The bone foreign body was grasped with the long paean forceps under fluoroscopy and withdrawn from the oesophagus while checking with an endoscope.

An additional aim was to measure the dust formation during feeding. The experiment was a crossover design with six horses (11&#160;&#177;&#160;4 years old, mean&#160;&#177;&#160;SD), fed with 5&#160;kg (as-fed basis) of their feed (long hay or alfalfa cubes) overnight.

On an hourly basis, horses also spent more time eating and chewing the long hay compared to the cubes. The cube feeding led to a higher dust concentration of the inhalable fraction (&lt;100&#160;&#956;m), but not of the thoracic (&lt;10&#160;&#956;m) fraction. Nevertheless, average dust concentrations were generally low for both cubes and hay, whereby both were of sound hygienic status.</Abstract><Abstract>Our data suggest that feeding alfalfa-based cubes overnight generated shorter eating time and less chews than the long hay without major differences in the thoracic dust. Therefore, because of the decreased eating time and chews, alfalfa-based cubes should not be fed a sole forage source, especially when it is to be fed without restriction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastication</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medicago sativa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feeding Behavior</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poaceae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On ophthalmic examination, the menace response, dazzle reflex and pupillary light reflex were negative OU. The intraocular pressure was 27 mmHg in the right eye (OD) and 70 mmHg in the left eye (OS) despite the administration of antiglaucoma eyedrops. Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed a closed ciliary cleft OU. Ocular ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic materials in the vitreous OU and retinal detachment OS. When presented for recheck, an extensive malacic corneal ulcer was observed OS. To relieve pain in the blind eyes, enucleation OS and pharmacologic ciliary body ablation (CBA) OD were performed. Histologically, ocular melanosis, which is an inherited disease in the Cairn Terrier breed, was identified in the enucleated eye. The uvea was heavily pigmented. The iris and ciliary body were mildly distorted by a single population of large, round, nonneoplastic cells with pigmented cytoplasm. There was no evidence of an intraocular mass or metastasis before and after intravitreal CBA. This is the first report of bilateral ocular melanosis in a Shih-Tzu dog.

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mass in the right adrenal gland with a large caval thrombus obstructing the CVC and hepatic veins, which caused BCLS. Additionally, collateral vessels were formed between the CVC and azygos veins. No findings suggested obvious metastases. Based on CT findings, an en bloc resection of the adrenal tumour with caval thrombus, right hepatic division and segmental CVC was planned.</Abstract><Abstract>The preoperatively planned resection was feasible; the tumour was completely resected grossly.

In cats, thyroid carcinomas tend to be highly metastatic. The role of [18] F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in human thyroid carcinoma has been well established. However, guidelines have not yet been established for veterinary medicine. Metastasis assessment has typically been performed using CT in veterinary medicine; however, it is poorly sensitive in detecting regional lymph nodes or distant metastases if these lesions are not abnormally contrast-enhanced, enlarged or cause overt mass effects.

Oncolytic viruses have recently been the first step in the biological treatment of cancer, either genetically engineered or naturally occurring. They increase specifically inside cancer cells and destroy them without damaging normal tissues or producing a host immune response against tumour cells or expressing transgenes. One of the most known members of this family is the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a natural oncolytic virus that selectively induces apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in human cancer cells.</Abstract><Abstract>This study performed biochemical and molecular investigations with variable doses of NDV (32, 64, 128 HAU) and liposomal doxorubicin (9&#160;mg/kg) on mouse triple-negative mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1 and BALB/c models tumours for the first time.</Abstract><Abstract>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis in NDV-treated animal tumours showed increased expression of P21, P27 and P53 genes and decreased expression of CD34, integrin Alpha 5, VEGF and VEGF-R genes. Additional assessments in treated mouse models also showed that NDV increased ROS production, induced apoptosis, reduced tumour size and significantly improved prognosis, with no adverse effect on normal tissues.</Abstract><Abstract>These findings all together might indicate that NDV in combination with chemotherapy drugs could improve prognosis in cancer patients although many more conditions should be considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oncolytic Viruses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oncolytic Virotherapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Line</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breast Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Finally, complete surgical removal was selected. The mass was encapsulated and the dermis was expanded by spindle-shaped to polygonal neoplastic cells. These cells were arranged in interwoven pattern. Mitotic figures were infrequent. Masson's trichrome demonstrated the positive and blue staining of collagen. Immunohistochemically, the sections were uniformly positive for Vimentin and negative for Desmin, SMA and GFAP. A well-differentiated fibrosarcoma was diagnosed based on histopathological features. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this neoplasm.

We searched following databases for expert opinion-based literature: MEDLINE, CINAHL, ISI Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and World Health Organization (WHO). We extracted the textual data from texts using a standardised data extraction tool. Textual pooling was not possible, so the conclusions were presented in a narrative form. Eighteen texts were included in this review. The findings show that, the most repeated policies and strategies include implementing and strengthening bacterial resistance surveillance, developing national guidelines, improving public awareness; enhancing home and everyday life hygiene; improving prescribing patterns, improving laboratories capacity, promoting innovation and research in new drugs and technology and strengthening coordination. This review systematically gathered strategies that were recommended by textual publications. To our knowledge, this was the first systematic review of text and opinion in the field of bacterial resistance. These results can be used by policymakers, hospital managers, and governments, alongside the results of quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antimicrobial Stewardship</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, there are no published reports regarding the use of acetazolamide for this purpose in companion animals, despite the increasing popularity of laparoscopic techniques in veterinary medicine due to their advantages over open surgeries.</Abstract><Abstract>Thirty mixed-breed female dogs were included in the study and randomly assigned to one of three groups: OVE (median celiotomy ovariectomy; n = 10), OVEL (laparoscopic ovariectomy, n = 10) and OVELA (laparoscopic ovariectomy with acetazolamide preoperative administration; n = 10). Experienced surgeons performed all procedures, and the anaesthetic and analgesic protocols were identical for all animals. Acetazolamide was administered orally (at a dose of 25 mg/kg) 2 h prior to induction in the OVELA group. Postoperative pain was evaluated using serum cortisol, salivary cortisol, and the University of Melbourne Pain Scale (UMPS) Score.</Abstract><Abstract>Any statistical differences were observed in the UMPS scores when the OVELA group was compared to the OVEL group at 1 h after surgery (p = 0.515), 12 h (p = 0.375) and 24 h (p = 0.242). Animals undergoing open surgery (OVE group) had significantly higher pain scores at all times after surgery when compared with OVEL and OVELA groups. A high positive correlation (r = 0.792; p = 0.01) was found between serum and saliva cortisol concentrations. Mean saliva cortisol concentration was not significantly lower for the OVELA group compared to the other groups.</Abstract><Abstract>This study found evidence that preoperative administration of acetazolamide may be beneficial in managing postoperative pain in dogs after laparoscopic surgeries. However, further research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm this and to determine if acetazolamide should be included in a multimodal postoperative analgesia protocol for laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Acetazolamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Premedication</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bacteria in the samples were identified using a biochemical identification system and amplification of 16S rRNA, and the phylogenetic groupings of E. coli isolates were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reactions. In addition, PCR detection and analysis of virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes, and drug-resistant phenotypes of E. coli isolates were performed.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 116 pathogenic E. coli strains belonging to seven phylogenetic groups were isolated, with the majority of isolates in groups A and B1. Among the virulence genes, curli-encoding crl had the highest detection rate of 97.4%, followed by hemolysin-encoding hlyE with the detection rate of 94.82%.

However, bacterial diseases are common in farmed fish reared at high densities. Although antibiotics effectively treat these diseases, developing efficient methods to increase drug clearance in fish and decrease the concentrations of antibiotic residues in aquatic products is essential.</Abstract><Abstract>This study evaluates the effect of flowing water in the RAS on norfloxacin (NOR) pharmacokinetics in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus).</Abstract><Abstract>Channel catfish were randomly divided into the control group (RAS group) and the experimental group (flow-through aquaculture system group) (120 individuals/group). A NOR dose of 20&#160;mg/kg was then orally administered to the fish. Plasma, muscle, liver and kidney samples were collected up to 168 h after treatment. NOR concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental method.</Abstract><Abstract>Flowing water had a significant effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of NOR, increasing NOR clearance in the kidney, muscle and plasma. The time to maximum concentration of NOR was shorter in the plasma and longer in the kidney and liver. Moreover, flowing water increased the maximum concentration of NOR in the kidney, muscle and plasma and decreased the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration in the liver and plasma. Flowing water decreased the withdrawal period in muscle from 10 to 6 days.</Abstract><Abstract>These results indicate that flowing water can potentially increase NOR clearance in channel catfish.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ictaluridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Norfloxacin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The morphometric parameters of the lungs, bronchi, trachea, heart, thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity were measured.</Abstract><Abstract>In these studies, the position of organs such as the trachea, lungs and heart were monitored, and specified descriptions of CT scan images and anatomical observations were obtained. We realised that the heart in this animal was not inclined to the left, and due to the equal size of the lungs, the heart was almost on the midline. According to the measurements, 20.05% of the ventral cavity volume was thoracic cavity and 79.95% was abdominal cavity.</Abstract><Abstract>According to studies on guinea pigs, the right and left have the volume, and the heart is located between them on the midline without a tendency to the left. It seems that one of the reasons for the reluctance of the heart to the left and its placement on the midline in the guinea pig is that the volume of the two lungs is equal. In the case of guinea pigs, both numerical parameters are smaller than rabbits', but close to it. One of the most important factors in this study is that none of the animals were euthanised, and all of samples were alive after our study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Guinea Pigs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trachea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchi</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Considering the economic importance of chickens, development of a safe and effective method for exterminating PRMs is necessary. Ivermectin and allicin are effective against some ectoparasites; however, their acaricidal efficacies against PRMs remain unknown.</Abstract><Abstract>To evaluate individual and combined efficacies of ivermectin and allicin in exterminating PRMs.</Abstract><Abstract>Different concentrations (0.10-1.0&#160;mg/mL) of ivermectin (1&#160;mL) were applied via dropping method in different insect culture dishes (ICDs), prior to transferring PRMs. For the spraying method, PRMs were transferred to ICDs, before spraying ivermectin (1&#160;mg/mL) solution (1&#160;mL). Further, the acaricidal effect of allicin on PRMs was evaluated by applying different concentrations (0.25-1.0&#160;mg/mL) of allicin (1&#160;mL). The combined acaricidal effects of ivermectin and allicin were analysed using four concentration combinations.

The treatment groups received DEX at the rate of 3, 5, and 7 mg/kg commercial feed. Samples, i.e. thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and spleen, were collected on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of the experiment. Relative weight of the organs was calculated on each sampling day. The tissues were then processed and stained with haematoxylin and eosin stain for morphological and morphometric study.</Abstract><Abstract>The relative weight of lymphoid organs was found substantially (p &lt; 0.05) less in the DEX-treated groups. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in lobular size and the cortical-medullary ratio was observed in the thymus of the DEX-treated broilers. Follicular atrophy and massive depletion of lymphocytes were evident in the bursa of Fabricius. The mortality rate was also increased which was largely dependent on the dose and duration of DEX treatment.</Abstract><Abstract>The study results indicate that DEX treatment can alter the morphology and morphometry of lymphoid organs which might result in severe immunosuppression and increased mortality rate in broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Gland</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dexamethasone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

With odontogenic infection and abscessation, a bacterial aetiology can be proven by bacterial culture and identification. Although studies exist on the bacterial flora of dental abscesses, the information available to date on the bacterial flora of the oral cavity in healthy rabbits is limited.</Abstract><Abstract>This study aims to evaluate the cultivable bacterial flora in the oral cavity of healthy, young, pet rabbits and to compare this flora with the pathologic flora of odontogenic abscesses described in the literature.</Abstract><Abstract>Samples were collected from the oral cavity of 33 healthy, young pet rabbits undergoing routine procedures. Oral cavity culture specimens were collected by rolling a sterile flocked paediatric swab in the mouth. Identification was first attempted by morphological assessment, Gram staining and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Colonies that could not be identified by mass spectrometry were identified by amplification and molecular sequencing of a part of the 16s rRNA gene.</Abstract><Abstract>Bacteria were recovered from 100% of oral swabs; 220 isolates of 35 different genera of bacteria were cultured. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (19.8%), Rothia sp. (17.9%), Enterobacter sp. (7%), Staphylococcus sp. (6.6%) and Actinomyces sp. (5.7%). Four phyla are represented: Proteobacteria (38.3%), Firmicutes (30.5%), Actinobacteria (26.9%) and Bacteroidota (4.3%).</Abstract><Abstract>A wide range of commensal bacteria are present in the mouths of rabbits. Bacterial cultures taken from cases of dental abscesses often reveal bacteria.

One such compound is the fermented wheat germ extract (FWGE), named Avemar.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, we investigate the effects of Avemar in a feline-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome model. MBM lymphoid cells were acutely infected by the American feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-Petaluma (FIV-Pet) and the European FIV Pisa-M2 strains. FL-4 lymphoid cells, continuously producing FIV-Pet, served as a model for chronic infection. Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells were infected by either FIV-Pet or feline adenovirus (FeAdV) as a model for transactivation and opportunistic viral infection. Cell cultures were treated pre- and post-infection with serial dilutions of spray-dried FWGE (Avemar pulvis, AP), a standardized active ingredient in commercial Avemar products. Residual FIV and FeAdV infectivity was quantified.</Abstract><Abstract>In a concentration-dependent manner, AP inhibited replication of FIV strains in MBM and CRFK cells by 3-5&#160;log. Low AP concentration prevented FIV-Pet release from FL-4 cells. Higher concentrations destroyed virus-producing cells with cytopathic effects resembling apoptosis. AP strongly inhibited FeAdV production inside CRFK cells but not in HeLa cells. Adenovirus particles are then released via the disintegration of CRFK cells.</Abstract><Abstract>This report is the first to describe the antiviral effects of Avemar. Further studies are required to confirm its in vitro and in vivo effects and to investigate the potential for its use as a nutraceutical in FIV-infected felines or HIV-infected humans.</Abstract><Abstract>Avemar, as a single nutraceutical, inhibits FIV replication and destroys retrovirus carrier cells. An important conclusion is that prolonged Avemar treatment might reduce the number of retrovirus-producing cells in the host.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HeLa Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Culture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>HIV Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different levels of processing linseed on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood parameters and ruminate behaviour of lambs.</Abstract><Abstract>Fifty-six Moghani male lambs (3 months of age, initial average body weight = 28 &#177; 1.2&#160;kg) were allocated to seven experimental diets in randomized design (eight lambs per each treatment). The experimental diets were as follows: (1) control diet (without linseed), (2) 5% raw linseed, (3) 10% raw linseed, (4) 5% micronized linseed, (5) 10% micronized linseed, (6) 5% extruded linseed and (7) 10% extruded linseed. Lambs were fed ad libitum a basal diet as total mixed ration consisting of 25% concentrate and 75% hay.</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed that linseed level and processing method had no significant effect on dry matter intake. Average daily gain, final body weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in lambs were affected by experimental diets. The use of 10% micronized linseed and 10% of extruded linseed in the lambs' diet improved dry matter and crude protein digestibility significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Blood glucose concentration observed for lambs fed 10% of micronized or extruded linseed (LS) was not different from that observed in other groups, only from the values shown by lambs fed diets 1 (control) and 2 (5% raw LS). The lowest cholesterol and the highest blood urea nitrogen concentrations were related to lambs fed the control diet (p &lt; 0.001). Feeding processed linseed relative to control diet had no effect on feeding behaviour in lambs.</Abstract><Abstract>Results of this research showed that the use of extruded and micronized linseed at the level of 10% can improve FCR, nutrient digestibility, and blood parameters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Digestion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep, Domestic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Linseed Oil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutrients</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It was only sampled a posteriori, because three adult owners were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next-generation sequencing based on Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was performed on amplicons that were generated using a reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and buccal swabs, as well as a bronchoalveolar lavage with mean real cycle threshold (qCt) value of 36 based on the Nucleocapsid (N) gene. Descriptive comparisons to known sequences in Botswana and internationally were made using mutation profiling analysis and phylogenetic inferences. Human samples were not available. A near-full length SARS-CoV-2 genome (&#8764;90% coverage) was successfully genotyped and classified under clade 20 O and Pango-Lineage AY.43 (Pango v.4.0.6 PLEARN-v1.3; 2022-04-21), which is a sublineage of the Delta variant of concern (VOC) (formerly called B.1.617.2, first detected in India). We did not identify novel mutations that may be used to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the dog and humans. In addition to Spike (S) region mutation profiling, we performed phylogenetic analysis including 30 Delta sequences publicly available reference also isolated from dogs. In addition, we performed another exploratory analysis to investigate the phylogenetic relatedness of sequence isolated from dog with those from humans in Botswana (n = 1303) as of 31 March 2022 and of same sublineage. Expectedly, the sequence formed a cluster with Delta sublineages - AY.43, AY.116 and B.1.617.2 - circulating in same time frame. This is the first documented report of human-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dog in Botswana. Although the direction of transmission remains unknown, this study further affirms the need for monitoring pets during different COVID-19 waves for possible clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 transmissions between species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>SARS-CoV-2</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wolves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Botswana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>COVID-19</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To translate cancer research findings into clinical interventions for patients, appropriate animal experimental models, particularly in oral cancer therapy, can be helpful. In vitro experiments using animal or human cells can provide insight into cancer's biochemical pathways. This review discusses the various animal models used in recent years for research and clinical intervention in oral cancer, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We highlight the advantages and limitations of the used animal models in oral cancer research and therapy by searching the terms of animal models, oral cancer, oral cancer therapy, oral cancer research, and animals to find all relevant publications during 2010-2023. Mouse models, widely used in cancer research, can help us understand protein and gene functions in vivo and molecular pathways more deeply. To induce cancer in rodents, xenografts are often used, but companion animals with spontaneous tumours are underutilized for rapid advancement in human and veterinary cancer treatments. Like humans with cancer, companion animals exhibit biological behaviour, treatment responses, and cytotoxic agent responses similar to humans. In companion animal models, disease progression is more rapid, and the animals have a shorter lifespan. Animal models allow researchers to study how immune cells interact with cancer cells and how they can be targeted specifically. Additionally, animal models have been extensively used in research on oral cancers, so researchers can use existing knowledge and tools to better understand oral cancers using animal models.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Models, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mouth Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A linear foreign body was diagnosed and an exploratory laparotomy performed. The foreign body was pushed orad and removed via gastrotomy. Two mesenteric duodenal perforations were found: one at the level of the common bile duct and a second at the duodenal flexure. Both lesions were debrided and primarily closed in a simple interrupted appositional pattern. A gastrostomy tube and closed suction drain were placed routinely. The dog recovered without complications and ate voluntarily the first day postoperatively. The drain and gastrostomy tube were removed without incident at 4 and 15 days, respectively. Five months postoperatively the dog was reported to be clinically normal.

Physical examination revealed lethargy, tachypnoea and 7% dehydration. Complete blood count and serum chemistry results were unremarkable, and venous blood gas analysis revealed hypokalaemia and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Urinalysis revealed a urine specific gravity (USG) of 1.005, pH of 7.0 and proteinuria, and the bacterial culture was negative. Based on these results, the dog was diagnosed with distal renal tubular acidosis, and potassium citrate was prescribed to correct metabolic acidosis. In addition, concurrent diabetes insipidus (DI) was suspected because the dog showed persistent polyuria, polydipsia and a USG below 1.006 despite dehydration. After 3 days of initial treatment, acidosis was corrected, and vomiting resolved. Desmopressin acetate and hydrochlorothiazide were also prescribed for DI, but the USG was not normalized.

Therefore, creating vaccinations delivered through the mucosa may be crucial for managing brucellosis. Consequently, we assessed the efficacy of a recombinant oral antigen delivery system based on Lactococcus lactis for Brucella abortus omp25 antigen.</Abstract><Abstract>Oral vaccinations with L. lactis transformed with pNZ8148 variants encoding for omp25 (pNZ8148:omp25) and free-pNZ8148 were administered to mice. On day 30, following immunization in animal groups, anti-omp25-specific IgG1 antibodies were assessed by the ELISA test. Additionally, nasal and bronchoalveolar lavages containing omp25-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) were analysed by ELISA. ELISA test and real-time PCR were also used to analyse cytokine responses up to 28 days following the last boost. In addition, the protective potential of L. lactis pNZ8148:omp25 vaccines was assessed in BALB/c mice by exposing them to the B. abortus strain.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on the initial screening results, the omp25 protein was identified for immunogenicity because it had the maximum solubility and flexibility and antigenic values of 0.75. The produced plasmid was digested using KpnI and XbaI. By electrophoretic isolation of the digestion fragments at 786&#160;bp, the omp25 gene, the successful production of the recombinant plasmid, was confirmed. Antigen expression at the protein level revealed that the target group generated the 25&#160;kDa-sized omp25 protein, but there was no protein expression in the control group. Fourteen days after priming, there was a considerable amount of omp25-specific IgG1 in the sera of mice vaccinated with pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001 in target groups compared to the phosphate-buffered saline control group). IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; levels were more significant in samples from mice that had been given the pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRBA vaccinations, in samples taken on days 14 and 28, respectively (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001). The pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRBA immunization groups had significantly greater IL-4 and IL-10 transcription levels than the other groups. The spleen portions from the pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRIBA vac group had less extensive spleen injuries, alveolar oedema, lymphocyte infiltration and morphological damage due to the inflammatory process.</Abstract><Abstract>Our study offers a novel method for using the food-grade, non-pathogenic and noncommercial bacterium L. lactis as a protein cell factory to produce the novel immunogenic fusion candidate romp25.

Complications, clinical follow-up, and objective gait analysis (OGA) were recorded for at least 6 months. An online survey was completed by owners after study completion.</Abstract><Abstract>Ten dogs with thoracic limb pathology and two with pelvic limb pathology were included. The most common site of amputation was mid-radius (n = 5). Eleven of 12 dogs demonstrated quadrupedal gait on OGA with mean per cent body weight distribution (%BWD) of 26% on thoracic limb prostheses and a %BWD of 16% for the one pelvic limb prosthesis that OGA data were available for. Complications included prosthesis suspension difficulties (n = 5), pressure sores (4), bursitis (4), postoperative infection (3), prosthesis aversion (2), dermatitis (1), and owner noncompliance (1). Two owners elected to discontinue prosthesis use.</Abstract><Abstract>PLASP allowed restoration of quadrupedal gait patterns in most patients. Owners reported overall positive satisfaction, though a high complication rate was observed. PLASP should be considered in select cases as an alternative to total limb amputation for dogs with distal limb pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Artificial Limbs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Amputation, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fast-growing broilers are especially susceptible to bone abnormalities, causing major problems for broiler producers. Strontium ranelate (SrR) has been used successfully for the treatment of osteoporosis in humans. In addition, cerium oxide (CeO) is an anti-stress agent applied in the biological system.</Abstract><Abstract>This study was conducted to investigate the effect of SrR, CeO, and their combinations on tibia quality in broilers. A total of 384 one-day-old Ross chicks were divided into six treatments, with four replicates per treatment (16 birds per replicate). The control group was fed a standard diet, and other groups were fed SrR at levels 450, 900&#160;mg/kg feed, CeO at levels 300 and 600&#160;mg/kg feed and a combination of 450 SrR + 300 CeO mg/kg feed. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone strength (BS), tibia area, tibia weight, bone Length, bone diameter, minerals in tibia bone of male broilers, alkaline phosphatase gene (ALP) and osteocalcin gene (OC) in male broilers were analysed.</Abstract><Abstract>The results showed that the addition of SrR and CeO had no significant influence (p &gt; 0.01) on BMD, BMC, BS, bone weight, bone length and bone diameter. While there was a significant interaction between sex and treatments, especially in the combination group, BS in females significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased compared to the control group. Generally, females were found to be more responsive to treatments than males. Significant increases in gene expression were noticed in OC with the addition of low levels of SrR and CeO and mixed group compared to the control. The gene expression of ALP was increased significantly only in a combination group compared to the control group.</Abstract><Abstract>It is concluded that SrR and CeO can be used as beneficial additives in the feed to improve the tibia quality of broilers.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteocalcin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Alkaline Phosphatase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On physical examination, moderate pain was elicited by performing the biceps test and isolated full elbow extension on the left thoracic limb. Gait analysis showed asymmetrical peak vertical force and vertical impulse between thoracic limbs. Computed tomography (CT) revealed enthesophyte formation on the ulnar tuberosity of the left elbow joint. Ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous fibre pattern at the biceps tendon insertion site on the left elbow joint. These findings confirmed insertional biceps tendinopathy based on physical examination, CT and ultrasonography results. The dog received an intra-articular triamcinolone acetonide injection with hyaluronic acid in the left elbow joint. Clinical signs improved after the first injection, including a range of motion, pain and gait. A second injection was given in the same manner because of recurring mild lameness 3 months later. No clinical signs were observed during the follow-up period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triamcinolone Acetonide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intra-Articular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendinopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, these insects confront many disease threats (viruses, parasites, bacteria and fungi) and large pesticide concentrations in the environment. Varroa destructor is the most prevalent disease that has had the most negative effects on the fitness and survival of different honey bees (Apis mellifera and A. cerana). Moreover, honey bees are social insects and this ectoparasite can be easily transmitted within and across bee colonies.</Abstract><Abstract>This review aims to provide a survey of the diversity and distribution of important bee infections and possible management and treatment options, so that honey bee colony health can be maintained.</Abstract><Abstract>We used PRISMA guidelines throughout article selection, published between January 1960 and December 2020. PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Ovid databases were searched.</Abstract><Abstract>We have collected 132 articles and retained 106 articles for this study. The data obtained revealed that V. destructor and Nosema spp. were found to be the major pathogens of honey bees worldwide. The impact of these infections can result in the incapacity of forager bees to fly, disorientation, paralysis, and death of many individuals in the colony. We find that both hygienic and chemical pest management strategies must be implemented to prevent, reduce the parasite loads and transmission of pathogens. The use of an effective miticide (fluvalinate-tau, coumaphos and amitraz) now seems to be an essential and common practice required to minimise the impact of Varroa mites and other pathogens on bee colonies. New, alternative biofriendly control methods, are on the rise, and could be critical for maintaining honey bee hive health and improving honey productivity.</Abstract><Abstract>We suggest that critical health control methods be adopted globally and that an international monitoring system be implemented to determine honey bee colony safety, regularly identify parasite prevalence, as well as potential risk factors, so that the impact of pathogens on bee health can be recognised and quantified on a global scale.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nosema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pesticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Varroidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our research tests the hypothesis that intrapartum uterine torsion impairs the ability of the placenta to synthesize steroids and may also suppress the release of synthesized steroids into the maternal circulation.</Abstract><Abstract>The study included a total number of 37 intrapartum dairy cows of various breeds and ages. These animals were transported to our clinic by their owners. Furthermore, general and obstetrical examinations of all these animals were performed in our clinic. The uterine torsion (UT) group consisted of 20 animals. The presence of UT was verified during clinical general examinations by vaginal and transrectal examination. The comparison (C) group included 17 animals whose birth was undisturbed or could be terminated with moderate obstetrical assistance. The clinical examination of group C animals showed no problems with their general health and genital organs. Blood samples were collected immediately after the initial obstetrical examination from 37 cows for radioimmunological measurement of estradiol-17&#946; (E2), free total estrogen (FTE), conjugated total estrogen (CTE), and progesterone (P4).</Abstract><Abstract>In terms of P4, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. For all estrogen parameters, however, concentrations were significantly lower in the UT group than in the C group. In the correlation analysis, there was a significant correlation between the P4 and the FTE in the C group. Furthermore, the positive correlation between all estrogen parameters in the UT group was significant. In group C, significant positive correlations were found apart from the correlation between E2 and CTE.</Abstract><Abstract>The results are consistent with the hypothesis and suggest that in UT animals processes dependent on estrogens or other placental hormones may be impaired during the peri- or postpartum period.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrogens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Placenta</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Steroids</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Whether such combinations are clinically advantageous remains to be explored together with tumour-specific markers.</Abstract><Abstract>To investigate if triple combination of lomustine, temozolomide and irradiation reduces canine glioma cell survival in vitro.</Abstract><Abstract>We evaluated the sensitising effect of CCNU alone and in combination with TMZ-irradiation in canine glioma J3T-BG cells and long-term drug-exposed subclones by using clonogenic survival and proliferation assays. Bisulphite-SEQ and Western Blot were used to investigate molecular alterations.</Abstract><Abstract>TMZ (200&#160;&#956;M) or CCNU alone (5&#160;&#956;M) reduced the irradiated survival fraction (4&#160;Gy) from 60% to 38% (p&#160;= 0.0074) and 26% (p&#160;= 0.0002), respectively. The double-drug combination reduced the irradiated survival fraction (4&#160;Gy) more potently to 12% (p&#160;&lt; 0.0001). After long-term drug exposure, both subclones show higher IC50 values against CCNU and TMZ. For CCNU-resistant cells, both, single-drug CCNU (p&#160;= 0.0006) and TMZ (p&#160;= 0.0326) treatment combined with irradiation (4&#160;Gy) remained effective. The double-drug-irradiation combination reduced the cell survival by 86% (p&#160;&lt; 0.0001), compared to 92% in the parental (nonresistant) cell line. For TMZ-resistant cells, only the double-drug combination with irradiation (4&#160;Gy) reduced the cell survival by 88% (p&#160;= 0.0057) while single-drug treatment lost efficacy. Chemoresistant cell lines demonstrated higher P-gp expression while MGMT-methylation profile analysis showed a general high methylation level in the parental and long-term treated cell lines.</Abstract><Abstract>Our findings indicate that combining CCNU with TMZ-irradiation significantly reduces canine glioma cell survival.

The intestine is the first AFB1 target organ destroyed after the bird's body is induced. This review summarises the current knowledge of the negative results of AFB1 -induced intestinal damage on broiler production. It was conducted in accordance with the relevant studies in the cited literatures being retrieved from PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Web of Science. First, AFB1 can change the intestinal barrier function by destroying the intestinal architecture, tissue and cell integrity of the gut epithelium. Second, AFB1 can damage the immune barrier function of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Third, the microbiota of birds interacts closely with the ingested aflatoxin. Finally, because broilers are tremendously sensitive to AFB1 contamination, the poisonous and noxious effects of this mycotoxin in the broiler industry cause millions of dollars in losses every year. This review briefly discussed that the AFB1 , which affects the intestines of broiler chickens, was reduced the immune apparatus, antioxidant protection system, gastric system, and broiler production status and its impact on human health. Therefore, this review will improve our perception of the important intestine in a bird's health and the adverse effect of AFB1 .</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Tract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aflatoxin B1</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Nanoparticles (NPs) show the advantages of high absorption and bioavailability with more effective delivery to the target tissue than their bulk particles. Various nanomaterials are available in different forms, sizes, shapes, applications, surface modifications, charges and natures. Nanoparticles can be utilised in the delivery of medicines, targeting them to their right effective site in the body and, at the same time, decreasing their toxicity and side effects. Furthermore, nanotechnology can be beneficial in the diagnosis of diseases and prevention of them and in enhancing the quality of animal products. There are different mechanisms through which NPs could exert their action. Despite the vast benefits of NPs in poultry production, some concerns about their safety and hazardous effects should be considered. Therefore, this review article focuses on NPs' types, manufacture, mechanism of action and applications regarding safety and hazard impact.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poultry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nanotechnology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nanostructures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nanoparticles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Rearing pigs in rural regions in Nepal is a common practice for subsistence farming. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites (GIPs) in pigs raised in Western Nepal.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 200 faecal samples from commercial and smallholder farms were examined by wet mounts, flotation, sedimentation and staining techniques.</Abstract><Abstract>The results revealed that overall 86.5% of samples were found shedding oocysts or eggs of one or more GIPs. Three species of protozoa [Eimeria sp. (26%), Entamoeba coli (25.5%) and Coccidia (29%)] and nine species of helminths parasites (Ascaris suum (32.5%), Trichuris suis (30%), strongyle-type nematode (27.5%), hookworm (26%), Fasciola sp. (17.5%), Physaloptera sp. (17.5%), Strongyloides sp. (17.5%), Metastrongylus sp. (8%) and Oesophagostomum sp. (5.5%)] were identified. Female pigs were found to have higher protozoan infection than males, but such a difference was not noticed with regard to helminth parasites. Strongyles and Oesophagostomum infection were higher in commercial farms compared to smallholder farms, whereas the prevalences of E. coli and other protozoans were higher in smallholder farms. Among the contextual factors evaluated for association, weight and gender of pigs, and annual income and gender of managers/caretakers were significantly (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) associated with the prevalence of GIPs in pigs. The overall prevalence of certain helminths such as strongyle-type nematode and A. suum was significantly (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) associated with the weight of pigs after adjusting other contextual factors.</Abstract><Abstract>This study detected relatively high prevalence of intestinal parasites in domestic pig facilities. Molecular epidemiological studies are essential to verify the exact zoonotic potential of parasites carried by pigs in the region.

Endotracheal intubation was only able to be achieved using videoscopic guidance and identified concern for severe nasopharyngeal stenosis. A computerized tomography scan revealed otitis interna, narrowed nasopharynx and no definitive cause for the stertorous breathing. The cat recovered very slowly from anaesthesia due to concern for airway obstruction following extubation. It was discharged the following day and then passed away at home 2 weeks later. Necropsy revealed that the epiglottis was obscured by 2&#160;cm of redundant mucosal tissue extending from the base of the tongue to the larynx resulting in epiglottic entrapment. Also noted was chronic, severe otitis interna and externa.

Case of unilateral pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as a complication of cystotomy.</Title>	<Abstract>Pyelonephritis is a serious condition that is rarely described in horses. In contrast, urinary tract infections are common in humans and small animals, and multi-drug-resistant urinary infections are an emerging threat. In this report, we describe a horse with unilateral pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex. [Correction added on 9 August 2023, after first online publication: The preceding sentence was corrected.] An 11-year-old Swedish warmblood gelding was diagnosed with a cystolith and a cystotomy through an open left para-inguinal approach was performed. Seven days after surgery the horse presented with pyrexia, dullness and colic. Diagnostic testing and renal transabdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a right-sided pyelonephritis. Culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a pure growth of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing E. cloacae complex bacteria with resistance against beta-lactams, aminoglycoside and trimethoprim-sulphonamide classes. Treatment included prolonged oral antimicrobials according to susceptibility testing results (enrofloxacin), judicious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluid therapy and gastric ulcer prophylaxis. The horse recovered successfully and is currently in good health (follow-up of 5 years). Once the infection resolved, unilateral renal scarring occurred. Multidrug-resistant upper-urinary infections occur in horses and should be considered in a post-surgical patient that develops fever. Early diagnosis, urine bacterial culturing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were crucial in this case to successful management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Lactamases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyelonephritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The mechanical forces have been implicated in every aspect of tendon biology. Tendon injuries are frequently occurring and their response to treatments is often unsatisfactory. A better understanding of tendon biomechanics and mechanobiology can help develop treatment options to improve clinical outcomes. Recently, tendon tissue engineering has gained more attention as an alternative treatment due to its potential to overcome the limitations of current treatments. This review first provides a summary of tendon mechanical properties, focusing on recent findings of tendon mechanobiological responses. In the next step, we highlight the biomechanical parameters of equine energy-storing and positional tendons. The final section is devoted to how mechanical loading contributes to tenogenic differentiation using bioreactor systems. This study may help develop novel strategies for tendon injury prevention or accelerate and improve tendon healing.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendon Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Regeneration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horse Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

DCH-infected cats were also found positive (54.54%, 12/22) for Feline leukaemia virus infection. BLAST results revealed that Turkish DCHs have 86.32%-99.08% homology with strains in the GenBank database, enabling us to construct phylogenetic trees.</Abstract><Abstract>According to this study's results, it is suggested that this infection should be added to veterinary diagnostic panels worldwide. Additionally, we suggest that our new synthesized primers for the amplification of X gene can also be used for diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orthohepadnavirus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phylogeny</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepadnaviridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genome, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genomics</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We analysed the DNA methylation levels of 72,367 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites) in all 63 samples.</Abstract><Abstract>Although a large fraction of CpG sites that were highly methylated in the normal liver became hypomethylated in tumours from most patients, we also found some patients with less remarkable change or no change in DNA methylation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that 32 of 37 tumour samples differed from normal livers, although the remaining 5 tumour livers fell into the same cluster as normal livers. In addition, the number of hypermethylated genes in tumour livers varied among tumour cases, suggesting various DNA methylation patterns in different tumour groups. However, patient and clinical parameters, such as age, were not associated with DNA methylation status. In conclusion, we found that HCTs undergo aberrant and diverse patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation compared with normal liver tissue, suggesting a complex epigenetic mechanism in canine HCT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA Methylation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Hepatocellular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epigenesis, Genetic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Genomic DNA was extracted from 40 tissue samples using a Qiagen DNA tissue extraction kit and genetic polymorphism was estimated using GenAlEx6.502 software.</Abstract><Abstract>The result showed that four loci were polymorphic and produced 3-6 alleles per locus, while the number of effective alleles (Ne) and the number of distinct alleles (Na) were 1.370 and 2.063, respectively. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were expanded between 0.100.50 and 0.115-0.265, respectively. Baro River population revealed the highest mean expected heterozygosity of 0.265, whereas the lowest expected mean heterozygosity of 0.115 was from the Alwero Dam. The genetic differentiation between populations (FST) resulted in a moderate to a very high degree of divergence between the populations.

In veterinary medicine, vaccination not only reduces disease within animal populations but also serves to enhance public health by targeting zoonoses. Nevertheless, for many pathogens, an effective vaccine remains elusive. Recently, nanovaccines have proved to be successful for various infectious and non-infectious diseases of animals. These novel technologies, such as virus-like particles, self-assembling proteins, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes and virosomes, offer great potential for solving many of the vaccine production challenges. Their benefits include low immunotoxicity, antigen stability, enhanced immunogenicity, flexibility sustained release and the ability to evoke both humoral and cellular immune responses. Nanovaccines are more efficient than traditional vaccines due to ease of control and plasticity in their physio-chemical properties. They use a highly targeted immunological approach which can provide strong and long-lasting immunity. This article reviews the currently available nanovaccine technology and considers its utility for both infectious diseases and non-infectious diseases such as auto-immunity and cancer. Future research opportunities and application challenges from bench to clinical usage are also discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Noncommunicable Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Public Health</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Specifically, two cases had hyperadrenocorticism and one case was diagnosed with pancreatitis with acute renal injury. In all cases, the thrombi were found within the right atrium, necessitating a differentiation from cardiac neoplasia. In all three cases, the structures assumed to be thrombi had irregular margins with interspersed hypoechoic regions, which were later confirmed as thrombi based on the responsiveness to therapy. All three cases were prescribed with the combination of clopidogrel and rivaroxaban.The thrombi gradually disappeared after initiation of the combination therapy. Complete resolution of right atrial thrombosis was noted in each dog treated with clopidogrel and rivaroxaban. This combination therapy appears to be safe and well tolerated.

The bioinformatics analysis was used to identify nsSNPs in the Tali breed and was compared with the Saanen goat. Four online bioinformatics tools (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant, Protein Variation Effect Analyzer, Polymorphism Phenotyping version2 and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database and Gene Ontology) showed three deleterious missense nsSNPs and seven natural missense SNPs in these HSPs genes of Tali goat.</Abstract><Abstract>Out of 10 reported nsSNPs, 5 nsSNPs in HSP70A4, 1 nsSNP inHSP70A9, 2 nsSNPs in HSP40C17, 1 nsSNP in HSP40C27 and 1 nsSNP in HSPD1 were detected. ConSurf tools showed that the majority of the predicted nsSNPs occur in conserved sites. Moreover, several post-translational modification (PTM) predictors computed the probability of post-translation change of nsSNPs. The putative phosphorylation and glycosylation sites in HSPs proteins were substitutions rs669769139 and rs666336692 of the Tali goat breed.</Abstract><Abstract>These results on the effect of type of genetic variants on the function of HSP proteins will assist to predict the resistance to hard conditions in goat breeds. Considering that the identified SNPid rs669769139 (S248) which is located on the N-terminal ATPase domain of HSP70A4 is a PTM site with a highly conserved score and a natural substitution on changing the stability and benign protein that can affect the functional and structural characterization of HSPs protein for adaptation to the local climate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heat-Shock Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Base Sequence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This disease is endemic throughout many African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. This systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine the RVF prevalence in humans, mosquitoes and other animal species in Africa. The review also provides contemporary data on RVF case fatality rate (CFR) in humans. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, a comprehensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Global Index Medicus databases from January 2000 to June 2022 to identify relevant studies. Pooled CFR and prevalence estimates were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed, and the I[2] -statistic was used to investigate a potential source of heterogeneity. A total of 205 articles were included in the final analysis. The overall RVF CFR in humans was found to be 27.5% [95% CI = 8.0-52.5]. The overall pooled prevalence was 7.8% [95% CI = 6.2-9.6] in humans and 9.3% [95% CI = 8.1-10.6] in animals, respectively. The RVF prevalence in individual mosquitoes ranged from 0.0% to 25%. Subgroup analysis showed substantial heterogeneity with respect to geographical regions and human categories. The study shows that there is a correspondingly similar prevalence of RVF in human and animals; however, human CFR is much higher than the observed prevalence. The lack of a surveillance programme and the fact that this virus has subclinical circulation in animals and humans could explain these observations. The implementation of a One Health approach for RVF surveillance and control would be of great interest for human and animal health.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Africa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Culicidae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rift Valley Fever</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rift Valley fever virus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The outbreak of such infections, including Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bronchitis and infectious bursal disease, could undermine poultry performance leading to decreased meat and egg production. The potency of vaccines in recent times has dropped with the rise in the virulence of antigens, which can interrupt vaccination defence. Natural herbs and phytochemicals have been extensively recommended because of their vast advantageous effects. Garlic and its bioactive organo-sulphur compounds have been proven to have antiviral, immunomodulatory and other pharmaceutical properties. Remarkable effects in poultry include a decrease in viral loads, an increase in antibody titres, lessening inflammatory cytokines and augmenting antiviral gene expression; however, methods of preparation, the dose of bioactive compounds and proportions administered may cause disparities in different reports. Therefore, this review highlights the potential of garlic against viral diseases, immunomodulatory, toxicity and pathological status in embryonated chicken eggs and poultry.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Prevalence of profiles I, II and III were 25.6, 5.4 and 4.1%, and an overall prevalence 35.1%. Incidence of profiles I, II and III were 5.4, 0.3 and 0.0%, and an overall incidence 5.7% dogs per month. Incidence at the age ranges &lt;1 year, &#8805;1 year, &lt;7 years and &#8805;7 years evidenced a highest rate in the age range &lt;1 year (6.6% dogs per month). Parasitological diagnosis was positive in 19% dogs at the prevalence (85.7% profile I), and in 11% at the incidence (100% profile I). The clinical picture of 179 infected dogs showed 145 (81%) of profile I (82% subclinical); 21 (11.7%) of profile II (100% subclinical); and 13 (7.3%) of profile III (84.6% subclinical).

Neurological examination localised a lesion to the T3-L3 spinal cord segments. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar spine showed a well-defined extradural T1-weighted hyperintense non-contrast-enhancing mass, initially suggesting a potential haemorrhagic component. Exploratory surgery revealed a brownish extradural lumbar mass. Histologic examination concluded to a melanoma, most probably metastatic given the animal's previous medical history. This report highlights the importance of collecting a complete medical history, which can help in obtaining a preliminary differential diagnosis in cats with clinical signs of myelopathy. Although the location of this metastasis is particularly unusual both in human and veterinary medicine, making optimal treatment challenging for neurosurgeon, our increased understanding of immune and tumour cell biology during the past decade is likely to improve the future treatments of feline melanoma and its metastases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, after the prohibition of antibiotics because of the increasing disclosure related to public health issues, various products have been developed as alternatives. This study was carried out to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) or phytobiotics (essential oils [EOs] and alkaloids [ALKs]), blended feed additives on the growth performance, jejunum histomorphology, and cecal microbiota of broiler chickens. A total of 765 male Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed into 5 experimental groups, each having 9 replicates with 17 chicks. The experimental procedures were as follows: a control group without supplementation (T1); control group+ MCFAs and EOs blend (T2); control group+ different EOs blend (T3); control group+ ALK sanguinarine (T4); and control group+ EOs and ALK piperine mixture (T5). The results showed that, broilers fed with MCFAs blended with EOs had significantly greater body weight gain during overall period in comparision to the control and T3 groups. Further, only MCFAs blended with EOs group significantly improved jejnum morphology in comparison with the control group (p &#8804; 0.05). Besides, the MCFAs blended with EOs group significantly elevated propionate, acetate and butyrate concentration, and decreased the concentration of branch chain fatty acids in caecum (p &#8804; 0.05). The results indicated that, the combination of MCFAs and EOs seems to have improvement effects and could be preferred as an efficient feed additive in broiler production.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids, Volatile</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatty Acids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cecum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbiota</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this study is to validate a new method of gynaecological examination using a Scope VOR&amp;GDI videovaginoscope. Twenty-six heifers were used, divided into 2 groups with 13 animals, control group (GC) and videovaginoscopic group (GV). In the CG, vaginoscopy was performed with a vaginal speculum and in the GV with a Scope VOR&amp;GDI videovaginoscope. All heifers underwent vaginoscopy on day 0 (D0), and 9 days later, on day 9 (D9). Vaginoscopy provided adequate intravaginal inspection. In the CG, 23% (3/13) of the heifers showed discomfort during the test. In GV, vaginal inspection was better due to better image quality. The videovaginoscope is the most effective equipment for carrying out the vaginoscopy procedure in Nellore heifers, as it produces sharper and clearer images and can help in the diagnostic and therapeutic routine of veterinarians.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>37723902</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Research progress into the application of Mycobacterium phlei in veterinary medicine.</Title>	<Abstract>Mycobacterium phlei is a gram-positive acid-fast mycobacterium from the family Mycobacteriaceae. It is a valuable resource for both natural drugs and microecological preparations. It has been widely used in the field of human medicine; however, in the field of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, the research and application of M. phlei is still in the preliminary exploration stage. This study aims to summarize the research progress of M. phlei in the field of veterinary medicine and provide a valuable reference for future research. Key words, such as 'M. phlei', 'veterinary field', 'immune balancer', 'genome' and other relevant words to this study, were used to search through PubMed, Web of Science, SciELO, Science Direct and Google Scholar databases. The results showed that the culture conditions of M. phlei were relatively simple, but its bacterial composition and genome sequence were relatively complex, and various components in the cell wall may have immunoregulatory effects. Therefore, the inactivated preparation made from M. phlei can have various applications in the veterinary field, such as growth regulation, immune regulation, antitumour, anti-parasite and asthma treatment. The literature review indicates that M. phlei preparation is an efficient and convenient immune system balance agent. Despite the challenges associated with the use of M. phlei preparations, it has a strong potential for application in veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Rodents are the most important hosts of chiggers. The Anderson's niviventer rat, Niviventer andersoni, is an endemic species of rodent in China. However, few studies have involved this endemic rodent species and its ectoparasites including chiggers. According to the field investigation in five provincial regions of southwest China between 2001 and 2019, this paper retrospectively analysed the infestation and distribution of chiggers on the body surface of N. andersoni in southwest China for the first time. From 77 Anderson's niviventer rats captured, a total of 527 chiggers were collected and they were identified as 39 species and nine genera in two subfamilies of family Trombiculidae. Of 39 chigger species identified, Leptotrombidium deliense and L. scutellare are the most important vectors of scrub typhus in China. The overall infestation indexes were PM = 29.87%, MA = 6.84 and MI = 22.91, and the indexes of chigger mite community were Mf = 39, H' = 2.60, E = 0.71 and D = 0.12. The dominant chigger species are L. wenense, L. xiaguanense and L. fujianense with a total Cr = 51.04%, among which L. wenense is one of the six main vectors of scrub typhus in China. The dominant chigger species are of aggregated distribution among different individuals of the rats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

It faces challenges that include theft and parentage ascertainment. These challenges can benefit from recent molecular genomics and bioinformatics technologies.</Abstract><Abstract>We employed genomic analyses to establish potential ownership of a group of nine cattle that were being claimed by two farmers in Uganda. We investigated the genetic relationship of Ugandan cattle with regional indigenous breeds as well as exotic breeds that are currently present in Uganda. In addition, we investigated regions that are likely to be under selection in the Ugandan cattle.</Abstract><Abstract>Hair samples were collected from seven and two animals from farmers A and B, respectively. They were genotyped for 53,218 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers. To establish genetic relationships between the sampled animals, we performed genomic analyses including, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis and identity by state/descent. We also performed admixture and runs of homozygosity analyses to assess the ancestry composition and identify regions potentially under selection in Ugandan cattle, respectively.</Abstract><Abstract>The seven animals from Farmer A were genetically close to each other but showed minimal relationship with the disputed animals. The two animals from Farmer B were genetically distant from each other but showed greater similarity to four of the disputed animals. Four of the disputed animals showed great dissimilarity from the animals of both farmers. Comparison of these with the reference breeds revealed minimal European exotic genetic introgression into these animals, but rather high similarity to the Sheko. Results also revealed high homozygosity in the major histocompatibility complex regions.</Abstract><Abstract>Our results demonstrate the use of currently available genomic tools to empirically establish the ownership of cattle; these could be scaled up as a resourceful and viable tool that could be employed to support conflict resolution where reliable livestock identification is unavailable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Cachexia, bilateral blindness, stupor, severe drowsiness and lethargy with left and right movements of the head and neck were recorded after awakening and stimulation. Lambs died 10 days after the onset of the clinical signs. The lambs were necropsied, and after routine parasitology, bacteriology and histopathology, the occurrence of acute coenurosis was confirmed due to finding multiple cystic structures in the brain tissue. All lambs of the herd were treated with albendazole (orally, 25 mg/kg, two doses with an interval of 14 days). All shepherd dogs were treated with popantel (orally, one tablet/10 kg, two doses with an interval of 14 days). The affected lambs died despite this treatment. No new case of the disease was observed after the initiation of control measures. The present study shows the importance of preventive measure against coenurosis in a semi-intensive sheep farming system that includes implementing consistent parasite control programme in dogs being in contact with sheep.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cestode Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cysticercosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This was significantly higher than the 6.3% prevalence obtained by Giemsa staining blood smears (p &lt; 0.001). Giemsa staining also revealed a low parasitaemia of 0.05%. The PCR-based prevalence was not statistically different between the two districts (31.4 &#177; 0.04 and 33.8 &#177; 0.04% in Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine districts, respectively, p = 0.6). On the contrary, the results of blood smear examination (2.85 and 10% in Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine, respectively) differed significantly between the two sampling sites (p = 0.01). There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between the overall molecular infection prevalence when the samples were segregated based on animals' age or gender (p = 0.1 and 0.2, respectively) and a similar trend was observed for Giemsa staining. Ten PCR amplicons of the Tams1 gene (721&#160;bp) were subsequently sequenced from the two regions. The phylogenetic analyses showed 100% similarity between all sequences.

Data were extracted from 45 studies with 112 plant species from plant species belonging to 42 different families. The specific keywords were 'mastitis', 'dairy cows' and 'medicinal plants'.</Abstract><Abstract>The most cited plant species included Allium sativum L., Azadirachta indica and Eucalyptus globulus Labill with the latter further exploring its components. Microbial species causing mastitis mainly were Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The extraction methods used included maceration approach using ethanol, methanol and water as solvents for phytochemicals and chromatographic techniques for essential oils. A few studies explored the mode of action, and toxicities of the herbal extracts as well as evaluating their efficacy in clinical trials using animal models.</Abstract><Abstract>Plants with defined levels of phytochemicals were essential sources of antibacterials. Standardisation of analytical methods is required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plants, Medicinal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Milk</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus aureus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Breeding practices, such as both controlled and uncontrolled, and artificial insemination (AI) are the tools used to obtain the desired breeding objectives. The lower reproductive performance of indigenous dairy cows affects the total milk production and calf crops that are produced during their lifetime. Designing appropriate breeding objectives and breeding practices can improve the reproductive performance of dairy cows and their overall production performance.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the breeding, practices and performance of indigenous dairy cattle in the south western part of Ethiopia. The districts of Gesha and Chena were purposefully chosen. The study design for the 384 household surveys was a cross-sectional survey with a simple random sample approach. Data analysis was carried out by MS-Excel (2010) and the general linear model procedure of SAS of 2008.</Abstract><Abstract>The current study revealed that methods of breeding were predominantly natural-controlled mating, followed by natural-uncontrolled mating and AI in descending order. Breeding objectives were input function, output function, sociocultural and economic functions and assets and security functions in decreasing order of rank. Reproduction performance indexes of indigenous dairy cows age at first service (3.72&#160;&#177;&#160;0.05 years), age at first calving (AFC) (4.71&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07 years), calving interval (CI) (1.58&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 years), days open (DO) (4.26&#160;&#177;&#160;0.11 months), services per conception in natural mating (1.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08) and AI (2.73&#160;&#177;&#160;0.14), age of bull at maturity (4.17&#160;&#177;&#160;0.74 years), interoestrus interval (23.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.61 days), calves crop (7.53&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22) and the life span of indigenous dairy cow (11.94&#160;&#177;&#160;0.26 years) were significant (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01) between two districts, whereas the values of age of bull at maturity and number of services per conception in natural mating were significant (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) between districts.</Abstract><Abstract>Using AI and major reproduction performances, such as AFC, CI and DO of indigenous dairy cows in the study area, were very low. Therefore, concerned bodies should intervene to improve reproduction performance through the utilization of AI techniques, with the integration of forage development activities and improvements in livestock health care.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ethiopia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dairying</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproduction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insemination, Artificial</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The dorsomedial region of conjunctiva was partially swollen but the globe remained intact. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed intraocular haemorrhage, uveitis, and a limbal, corneoconjunctival ulcer near the swollen conjunctiva. During ocular ultrasonography (OUS), the sclera became indented and hypotony occurred, implicating a full-thickness scleral wound. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) confirmed a full-thickness scleral defect, which was surgically apposed. The intraocular pressure normalised and the uveitis subsided post-operatively.

It is posited that NHPs that live in close contact with humans serve as sentinels and reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</Abstract><Abstract>The objective was to characterize the oral and rectal bacteria in Ghanaian NHPs and profile the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolated bacteria.</Abstract><Abstract>Oral and rectal swabs were obtained from 40 immobilized wild and captive NHPs from 7 locations in Ghana. Standard bacteriological procedures were used in the isolation, preliminary identification, automated characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) of bacteria using the Vitek 2 Compact system.</Abstract><Abstract>Gram-negative bacteria dominated isolates from the rectal swabs (n&#160;=&#160;76, 85.4%), whereas Gram-positive bacteria were more common in the oral swabs (n&#160;=&#160;41, 82%). Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n&#160;=&#160;7, 14%) was the most occurring bacterial species isolated from the oral swabs, whereas Escherichia coli (n&#160;=&#160;32, 36%) dominated bacteria isolates from rectal swabs. Enterobacter spp. had the highest (39%) average phenotypic resistance to antimicrobials that were used for AST, whereas a trend of high resistance was recorded against norfloxacin, Ampicillin and Tetracycline in Gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus spp. had the highest (25%) average phenotypic resistance to antimicrobials used for AST, and a trend of high resistance was recorded against penicillin G and oxacillin.</Abstract><Abstract>This study has established that apparently healthy NHPs that live in anthropized environments in Ghana harbour zoonotic and antimicrobial resistant bacteria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The predominant species involved were dogs (299; 91.2%) and cats (12; 3.7%). Other species included pigs (4; 1.2%), goats (4; 1.2%), monkeys (4; 1.2%), sheep (2; 0.6%), bats (2; 0.6%) and cattle (1; 0.3%). The numbers of reported cases in animals were markedly higher than those in humans except in 2013 and 2017. There was a positive but weak correlation between cases in animals and humans which could be due to lack of reporting collaboration between institutions responsible for these. Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions were identified as hotspots in the period under review, while January and August were the months with the highest peaks for cases reported. Cases reported in rainy season were significantly higher than those in dry season. Poisson regression for spatio-temporal analyses showed no statistical significance in predicting number of rabies cases (response variable) from year, month, season, region and affected species (predictor variables).</Abstract><Abstract>Rabies remained endemic in Ghana during 2010-2017 with cases reported in nearly every month of the year during this period.

Plasma urea:creatinine ratio is an accepted biomarker of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in human medicine.</Abstract><Abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate plasma urea:creatinine ratio as a biomarker of gastrointestinal bleeding in a population of dogs with anaemia.</Abstract><Abstract>This was a prospective cross-sectional study of dogs with anaemia presenting to referral centres for the investigation of anaemia. Cases were categorised as having overt gastrointestinal bleeding (melena on presentation), occult gastrointestinal bleeding (historical and diagnostic findings consistent with gastrointestinal bleeding without melena at presentation) or anaemia of other cause (confident diagnosis other than gastrointestinal bleeding reached, normal diagnostic imaging of gastrointestinal tract). Urea:creatinine ratio at presentation was calculated by dividing urea (mg/dL) by creatinine (mg/dL).</Abstract><Abstract>Ninety-five dogs were included. Plasma urea:creatinine ratio was not significantly different between dogs with overt or occult gastrointestinal bleeding or those with anaemia of other cause (median urea:creatinine ratio 25.8, 20.7 and 22.5, respectively). No significant difference in urea:creatinine ratio was found between dogs with upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (median urea:creatinine ratio 19.4 and 24.6, respectively).</Abstract><Abstract>Plasma urea:creatinine ratio was not helpful in differentiating between dogs with anaemia resulting from gastrointestinal bleeding (overt or occult) and those with other causes of anaemia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Similar to dogs, stenotic nares emerge as a significant contributor in the development of BOAS in cats. In this study, we propose that stenotic nares in brachycephalic cats arise from an elongated dorsal lateral nasal cartilage. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a novel surgical technique to alleviate stenosis-associated clinical signs by performing full-thickness bilateral wedge resection of the excessive cartilage.</Abstract><Abstract>Seven cats that underwent rhinoplasty with full-thickness bilateral wedge resection along the dorsal lateral nasal cartilage between 2019 and 2022 at Pan-Asia Veterinary Clinic in Taipei, Taiwan.</Abstract><Abstract>Clinical data of all cats included in the study were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical procedures were recorded. A full-thickness bilateral wedge resection was made along the dorsal lateral nasal cartilage adjacent to the non-hairy area. The full-thickness wedge resection was then apposed and closed, resulting in the abduction of the wing of the nostrils. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated according to follow-up sessions by the authors, and an owner survey was conducted at least 6 months post-surgery.</Abstract><Abstract>All cats included in this study had a favourable outcome with no complications reported following surgery. The degree of nostril stenosis was improved, and relapse of clinical signs was not reported. Overall, the quality of life of cats that underwent rhinoplasty was significantly improved.</Abstract><Abstract>The results support that the innovative procedure described in this study is highly promising and holds great potential in restoring quality of life and halting disease progression of cats with BOAS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Cartilages</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Constriction, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Airway Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Craniosynostoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiographic and post-mortem studies disclosed complete transection of the spinal cord from traumatic dorsocranial luxation of the second lumbar vertebra, displacement of the sacrum from the ilium, seventh lumbar and first caudal vertebrae and multiple pelvic fractures. Other causes of forelimb extensor rigidity and neck hyperextension such as decerebrate and decerebellate rigidity were excluded by a lack of neurological signs consistent with these entities and unremarkable findings on post-mortem examination of the cranial cavity and brain and histological examination of the cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum.

Systems research at the interface between the three goes by several names, such as 'Eco-Health' and 'Planetary Health', each with a varied focus, but the concept of 'One Health' (OH) has stood out as the most popular one. COVID-19 has reiterated the importance of OH in response to health challenges. This review aimed to assess the OH approach integration and implementation level in Kerala state, India, in the context of emerging zoonotic diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted by searching for relevant articles with specific keywords across six electronic databases. This involved screening the initial hits for titles and abstracts, then systematic sorting to identify the ones that met the criteria, followed by more thorough scrutiny to finally shortlist the six studies to be included in the review. We found that OH in Kerala has made good progress, as evident from a few recent examples, but has a long way to go with significant challenges. In line with the study's aim, identifying and analysing what is already done, what is missing and what needs to be done can have wider implications for future OH implementation. Relevant threats and opportunities were identified, with lessons for Kerala and India and broader applications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zoonoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>India</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is important to consider the animal's physiological periods, especially the second half of the first pregnancy for mammary gland development.</Abstract><Abstract>By considering multiple factors and comparing them, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) can be utilized to conduct further assessments and select the best diet for the animals.</Abstract><Abstract>Forty primiparous Saanen does, from the last 2 months of pregnancy up to 4 months of lactation, have been assigned to four iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous diets. Four dietary groups included: no external sources of fat (negative control, CT), saturated palm oil (positive control), roasted soybeans (omega-6, SB) and extruded flaxseed (omega-3, FS). Twenty-two performance criteria such as feed intake, milk yield and composition, body weight, blood metabolites and hormones, the milk fatty acid profile, as well as morphological and histological measurements of the mammary gland, in the form of least-square means, were considered.</Abstract><Abstract>A decision-making tool was used to select the best form of fat supplements in late pregnancy and early lactation diets, to improve lactation performance in Saanen goats.

<Rec><Common><PMID>37882359</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Persistent socket pain in a dog after the enucleation of the eye and its clinical management.</Title>	<Abstract>Persistent socket pain is a condition described in humans after enucleation of the eye. This report aims at describing this condition in dogs. A 10-year-old male-neutered crossbreed was presented to the referral veterinary surgeon for enucleation of the right ocular globe. Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful although during the postoperative period the dog was reluctant to open the mouth and to be explored by the referral veteterinary surgeon. Despite treatment with meloxicam, paracetamol and tramadol, no improvements were observed. Ten weeks after surgery, the dog was referred to the Dick White referrals for further investigations. Ophthalmic examination was normal, though palpation of the wound triggered an avoidance response. Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes compatible with orbital cellulitis. The area of interest was evaluated with the use of the mechanical Von Frey filaments. A response, characterised by sudden turning of the head and attempts to withdraw it, was evoked with filament 4.93 (8.0 g) during stimulation of the periorbital area. After induction of anaesthesia, an ultrasound-guided injection containing levobupivacaine 0.5% and methylprednisolone was performed within the retrobulbar area. Three hours after recovery from anaesthesia, no discomfort was observed during palpation of the area. Re-evaluation was performed with the Von Frey filaments; no response could be evoked during testing with all 20 filaments (from 2.36 to 6.65) applied on either side of the face. The patient was discharged with a course of gabapentin and, 3 weeks after the intervention, the dog showed no clinical signs of pain. Persistent socket pain is an unpleasant sensation at the level of the enucleated orbit, and it should be regarded as a challenging condition to diagnose and treat. The MRI findings appeared to be essential to select the most appropriate interventional treatment. The injection of local anaesthetic and steroid into the retrobulbar space was useful for both confirming the diagnosis and treating pain by reducing the peripheral signalling and decreasing the residual inflammation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eye Enucleation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tramadol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study aimed to summarise the clinical and pathological features of congenital goitre in a goat kid. In April 2019, a dead female goat kid with a history of dystocia was referred to Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, to examine the carcass and find the reason for death. The necropsy were performed, along with histopathology examination, and clinical signs were recorded. Examination of the foetus revealed the presence of an enlarged thyroid gland, and the skin was thick with myxedema, pale, and without hair. After cutting the skin, the swelling showed a significantly enlarged thyroid gland with two asymmetrical lobes, with the right lobe 3.9&#215;7.1 cm and the left 3.7&#215;7.5 cm in size. In the histopathological examination, a severe proliferation of follicular cells was observed, which caused the thyroid gland to be microscopically dense. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of recognising and addressing congenital goitre in goat kids. To prevent such tragic outcomes, it is crucial to focus on early detection and intervention. Furthermore, the agents of goitre need to find out and be clear.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Teaching</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goiter</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Stenotic nares is a common feature of BOAS, and in dogs, the main cause is axial deviation of the alar cartilage. In contrast, narrowing of the nares in cats is predominantly the result of a redundant skin fold at the junction of the ventral floor of the nostrils and the haired skin of the lip. Three brachycephalic cats with inspiratory obstruction were referred to the surgery department of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The predominant cause of obstruction was nostril stenosis due to the presence of redundant skin on the ventral floor of the nares. All three cats underwent surgical correction using a single pedicle advancement flap technique, which was first described by Berns et al. (2020). All three cats had positive outcomes, with no surgical complications and no episodes of respiratory distress reported within a 9-month follow-up. Appropriate surgical treatment of feline patients with stenotic nares can result in good long-term outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Constriction, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Teaching</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Cavity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Airway Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Craniosynostoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study investigated the antifungal effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles on clinical isolates of M. canis in dogs and cats and subtilisin 1 (SUB1) gene expression.</Abstract><Abstract>Zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared using the wet chemical method at a concentration of 4000&#160;ppm. Its antifungal potential was evaluated at concentrations of 62.5-4000&#160;ppm by disk diffusion and microdilution methods against 10 isolates of M. canis. The effect of this product on SUB1 gene expression was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR method.</Abstract><Abstract>The results of the disk diffusion test showed that the highest inhibitory diameter was at the highest concentration of ZnO nanoparticles (34&#160;mm), and the inhibitory zone was observed in dilutions up to 250&#160;ppm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ZnO nanoparticles was between 250 and 500&#160;ppm, and the minimum fungicidal concentration was between 500 and 1000&#160;ppm. There was a significant reduction in SUB1 gene expression in sub-MIC concentration (125-250&#160;ppm) (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05).</Abstract><Abstract>This study showed that ZnO nanoparticles have a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on M. canis. Moreover, ZnO nanoparticles could decrease the expression of SUB1, an enzyme involved in fungi adhesion to the epidermis.

In recognition of this, the World Health Assembly in 2015 agreed on a global action plan to tackle AMR. Following the global emergence of the mcr-1-associated colistin resistance gene in the livestock industry in 2016, several countries including South Africa restricted the veterinary use of colistin as the gene threatens the clinical utility of the drug. This study is a follow-up to the restriction in place in order to evaluate the impact of such policy adoption.</Abstract><Abstract>To assess the prevalence of antibacterial resistance (ABR), and the mcr-1 colistin resistance gene in broiler chicken over a 2-year period, as a follow-up to the veterinary ban on colistin use in South Africa.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 520 swab samples were obtained during 2019 (March-April) and 2020 (February-March), from healthy broiler chicken carcasses (n&#160;=&#160;20) and chicken droppings in transport crates (n&#160;=&#160;20) at various poultry abattoirs (N&#160;=&#160;7) in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Escherichia coli organisms were isolated and subjected to a panel of 24 antibacterials using the MicroScan machine. Screening for mcr-1 colistin resistance gene was undertaken using PCR.</Abstract><Abstract>Four hundred and thirty-eight (438) E. coli strains were recovered and none demonstrated phenotypic resistance towards colistin, amikacin, carbapenems, tigecycline and piperacillin/tazobactam. The mcr-1 gene was not detected in any of the isolates tested. Resistances to the aminoglycosides (0%-9.8%) and fluoroquinolones (0%-18.9%) were generally low. Resistances to ampicillin (32%-39.3%) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (30.6%-3.6%) were fairly high. A significant (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) increase in cephalosporins and cephamycin resistance was noted in the year 2020 (February-March) when compared with the year 2019 (March-April).</Abstract><Abstract>The absence of mcr-1 gene and colistin resistance suggests that mitigation strategies adopted were effective and clearly demonstrated the significance of regulatory interventions in reducing resistance to critical drugs. Despite the drawback in regulatory framework such as free farmers access to antimicrobials OTC and a dual registration system in place, there is a general decline in the prevalence of ABR when the present data are compared with the last national veterinary surveillance on AMR (SANVAD 2007). To further drive resistance down, mitigation strategies should focus on strengthening regulatory framework, the withdrawal of OTC dispensing of antimicrobials, capping volumes of antimicrobials, banning growth promoters and investing on routine surveillance/monitoring of AMR and antimicrobial consumption.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The present paper deals with the first documented evidence of rabies in the stone marten (Martes foina). Rabies symptoms were observed in a marten in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province. The animal with a strange demeanour approached people without fear, which was died after some while. Samples were taken from its brain (cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus), shortly after death. In this report, laboratory evidence of rabies by fluorescent antibody (FAT) was proved. The present work is valuable because of the environmental importance of the stone marten. Hence, sensitive surveillance and advanced reporting systems should be regularly monitored on suspected cases of rabies in animals and humans to control and prevent this deadly disease. This involves exposure history, clinical examinations, symptoms and experimental results. Rabies can be controlled by fast diagnostic tests and vaccination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This article documents an adolescent female African elephant (Loxodonta africana) giving birth to an African elephant calf with a shoulder height below the mean, and its inability to stand for the first 10 h after birth, a time span that significantly exceeds the average duration for independent standing. Through the implementation of assisted feeding and assisted standing measures, the calf eventually achieved independent standing and nursing from its mother after 27 h and subsequent catch-up growth at 5 months of age. This study presents the first case report on the growth parameters during pregnancy of an adolescent African elephant, the birth and care (feeding, assisted standing) of a small African elephant calf with the inability to stand alone and nurse independently for several hours, highlighting pregnancy may influence the growth of cows during their ongoing growth and development phase, the calf's survival and subsequent catch-up growth at 5 months of age. These findings offer valuable insights into the care of abnormal African elephant calves.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Only dogs that had serum total calcium recorded and abdominal ultrasound were included in the study. All images were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist blinded to any patient identifiers.</Abstract><Abstract>Of the 58 dogs, 33% (19/58) had total hypercalcaemia, and of these, 68% had confirmed or suspected iliosacral lymph node metastasis. Total hypercalcaemia was significantly associated with confirmed or suspected iliosacral lymph node metastasis (p &lt; 0.01). However, 46% (11/24) of dogs with confirmed or suspected iliosacral lymph node metastasis were normocalcaemic.</Abstract><Abstract>Based on these results, it is suggested that while the presence of total hypercalcaemia may increase the likelihood of concurrent lymph node metastasis, total hypercalcaemia alone cannot be used as a screening tool for lymph node metastasis. Dogs diagnosed with ASACA should undergo full staging regardless of total serum calcium values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pet animals may be an important reservoir for human infection.</Abstract><Abstract>To determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles and mechanisms of Campylobacter isolates recovered from shelter-housed healthy and diarrheic cats and dogs in Erzurum province in Turkey.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 250 rectal swabs (from 124 cats and 126 dogs) collected between 2020 and 2021 were included in this study. The samples were cultured using a Campylobacter-selective agar medium. A single suspect colony from each plate was purified and species identification was performed by PCR. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined against eight antibiotics. Specific antimicrobial resistance genes (tetO and aphA-3) and mutations (in gyrA) were screened by PCR and/or sequencing.</Abstract><Abstract>A total of 26 (10.4%) isolates (25 Campylobacter jejuni and 1 Campylobacter coli) were obtained from the dogs; no Campylobacter was isolated from the cats. Of the C. jejuni isolates, 19.2% were resistant to nalidixic acid, 7.7% to ciprofloxacin and 3.8% to tetracycline and gentamicin per the CLSI interpretative criteria. The C. coli isolate was susceptible to all of the tested antibiotics. Thr-86-Ile mutation was the most common change detected in the gyrA gene in the quinolone-resistant isolates.</Abstract><Abstract>While geographic and population differences exist, Campylobacter carriage and associated antibiotic resistance in dogs is common, emphasising the need for continuous surveillance in this species, particularly given its zoonotic potential.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

For accurate diagnosis, treatment and surgery with minimal complications, it is necessary to be aware of the effects of sedatives and anaesthetics on the cardiovascular system and IOP.</Abstract><Abstract>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sedatives (medetomidine and midazolam) and anaesthetics (ketamine, propofol and isoflurane) on IOP, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure in dogs.</Abstract><Abstract>In this study, 10 dogs participated in three treatments using a randomised cross-over design, with a 1-week washout period between each treatment. Dogs in all treatments were premedicated with medetomidine and midazolam. Anaesthesia was induced using ketamine, propofol, or isoflurane and maintained for 60 min with the appropriate doses of each drug. The cardiovascular variables (heart rate, and systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures) and IOP were measured at different timepoints: before premedication (baseline values, T-Bas), 15 min after medetomidine administration (T-Med), 20 min after midazolam administration (T-Mid) and at 15 (T-15), 30 (T-30), 45 (T-45) and 60 (T-60) min after anaesthesia induction.</Abstract><Abstract>Medetomidine significantly reduced the IOP and HR and did not significantly change the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Midazolam significantly reduced the IOP while did not significantly change the HR and MAP. Ketamine and isoflurane significantly increased the IOP and HR while did not significantly change the MAP. Propofol significantly increased the HR, but did not cause significant changes in IOP and MAP.</Abstract><Abstract>Considering that anaesthetics are typically administered in conjunction with pre-anaesthetic drugs, the increases in IOP induced by ketamine and isoflurane are not important, as the IOP did not exceed the baseline values. However, further studies are required to investigate these effects in patients with elevated IOP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

We collected a total of 189 freshly voided faecal samples from different farms. We recorded the age, breed, milking status, sex, body condition score, and anthelmintic use history of the sampled animals. We processed the samples using the direct smear method, with the identification of one egg per sample being considered positive.</Abstract><Abstract>We estimated the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasite infection in large-scale (52.1%), medium-scale (54.5%), and small-scale farms (70.0%), with statistically significant differences (p &#8804; 0.05). Both pregnant and lactating cows, as well as indigenous cattle, were more likely to have gastrointestinal parasites (p &#8804; 0.05). The predominant parasites across farms of all sizes were trematodes (Paramphistomum spp. and Schistosomas spp.) and protozoa (Balantidium coli and Coccidia spp.).</Abstract><Abstract>Poor farm management practices, such as no pasture management and inadequate deworming regimens, may contribute to the elevated prevalence and infection load observed on small-scale farms. The increased parasitosis in previously dewormed animals can be attributed to the development of anthelmintic resistance against gastrointestinal parasites. Implementing proper and effective deworming strategies is crucial to preventing gastrointestinal parasitosis and mitigating the risk of anthelmintic resistance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 in slaughtered pigs and wild boars in Korea between 2018 and 2019.</Abstract><Abstract>Lungs and hilar lymph nodes of healthy pigs slaughtered in slaughterhouses and captured wild pigs were collected, and viruses were detected by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction and two staining methods (in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry) to confirm the presence of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3.</Abstract><Abstract>Positive rates of porcine circovirus 2 in lungs and hilar lymph nodes were 78.1% (75/96) and 89.5% (86/96) in slaughtered pigs, respectively. They were 18.0% (30/167) and 46.3% (24/55) in wild boars, respectively. Positive rates of porcine circovirus 3 in lungs and hilar lymph nodes were 30.2% (29/96) and 13.5% (13/96) in slaughtered pigs, respectively. They were 4.2% (7/167) and 5.5% (3/55) in wild boars, respectively. At the farm level, positive rates of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 were 97.9% (47/48) and 54.2% (26/48), respectively. Positive rates of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 decreased in spring. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 in lungs, but not porcine circovirus 3 in the hilar lymph nodes.</Abstract><Abstract>These results suggest that the prevalence of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 might vary depending on the season and the type of sample. Wild boars might play a role in the epidemiology of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine circovirus 3 in South Korea.

This review discusses the occurrence SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats and the role of these animals in transmitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to their owners. The data were collected from epidemiological studies and case reports that focused on studying the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in pet animals and their owners. Epidemiological studies and case reports indicate that dogs and cats are infected with SARS-CoV-2 either naturally or experimentally; however, the global number of naturally infected animals is far lower than the number of people who have COVID-19. These studies demonstrate that pet animals acquire the infection from direct contact with COVID-19-infected owners. Currently, there are no studies reporting that dogs and cats can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other animals and humans, under natural conditions. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in companion animals (dogs and cats) in different countries worldwide raises concerns that pets are at higher risk for spreading and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans and other animals, which poses a hazard to the public health. Therefore, investigating the role of dogs and cats in the transmission and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive measures against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physical examination revealed cranial abdominal pain. Haematology and serum biochemistry were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography and a computed tomography scan suggested a non-neoplastic mass compressing the gallbladder. During an exploratory laparotomy, a duplex gallbladder with two separate cystic ducts was diagnosed intraoperatively. The mass identified using the imaging techniques was an abnormal right gallbladder which was distended with immobile mucoid bile and a thickened wall. The left gallbladder and cystic duct were grossly normal. A cholecystectomy of both gallbladders was performed. Histopathology of the right gallbladder identified chronic cholecystitis. The cat made a good recovery from surgery and reported complete resolution of its hyporexia and a return to normal body weight.
