Blood loss was intermittent in all cases, but was severe enough to require blood transfusion in one case. Prostatic enlargement was detected on rectal palpation in all cases, and benign prostatic hyperplasia was diagnosed after elimination of other prostatic diseases (i.e., infection, cysts, neoplasia) using diagnostic imaging and clinical laboratory tests. Castration resulted in cessation of blood loss; whereas antiandrogen therapy, an alternative treatment to castration, was less effective.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Transfusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Castration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chlormadinone Acetate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Contraceptive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemorrhage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Hyperplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A diagnosis of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus was made based upon the finding of beta-cell specific antibodies. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia was diagnosed based on findings of a regenerative anemia, spherocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinuria, and bilirubinuria. The anemia resolved following two months of immunosuppressive therapy. The diabetes was treated with insulin for four months, after which time treatment was no longer necessary. However, the dog remained positive for beta-cell antibodies which may be a predictive marker for the recurrence of diabetes mellitus in the future.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acute Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Autoantibodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Autoimmune Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomarkers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperglycemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoglycemic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Islets of Langerhans</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

During a 94-month interval, 17 of 44 dogs (38.6%) with hypoadrenocorticism were found to have hypoalbuminemia. When compared to all dogs with hypoalbuminemia (9.8%) observed in the hospital population during this same interval, there appeared to be a significant association between canine adrenocortical insufficiency and hypoalbuminemia. The pathogenesis of the hypoalbuminemia in this study is speculative; possible mechanisms include gastrointestinal blood loss, protein-losing enteropathy, malassimilation, or decreased albumin synthesis.

With the exception of hematuria and proteinuria, results of other physical, clinicopathological, radiographic, and microbiologic evaluations were normal. Low concentrations of bovine herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4) antibodies (titer 1:40) were detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). A diagnosis of nonobstructive, idiopathic feline lower urinary tract disease was established by exclusion of other known causes of hematuria and dysuria. Clinical signs resolved in approximately seven days without symptomatic therapy. During the next 69 months, the owners observed five episodes of self-limiting, gross hematuria and pollakiuria. Persistent low titers of BHV-4 antibodies were detected by the IFAT. This case typifies the clinicopathological, radiographic, and microbiologic findings and the natural course characteristics of many cases of nonobstructive, idiopathic feline lower urinary tract disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Viral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesviridae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herpesviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteinuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recurrence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urination Disorders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Signalment, presenting clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, physical and neurological examination findings, results of diagnostic procedures, type of surgery performed, tumor location, relapse-free intervals and survival times, and causes of death were evaluated. Tumors were divided into three anatomical groups: tumors involving nerves distal to the brachial or lumbosacral plexus (Peripheral Group), tumors involving nerves of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus (Plexus Group), and tumors involving the vertebral canal (Root Group). The most common clinical findings were unilateral forelimb lameness and muscle atrophy. The most useful diagnostic tests were myelography and electromyography. Although there was no significant difference, dogs in the Root Group tended to have shorter relapse-free intervals and survival times than dogs in the Plexus Group.

Hypoventilation can be due to anesthetic-induced depression of the central nervous system, muscular relaxation of the muscles of respiration, and effects on central and peripheral chemoreceptors. Compared to mammals, respiratory function in birds may be more sensitive to the effects of inhalant anesthetics because of their effect on unique carbon dioxide (CO2)-sensitive intrapulmonary chemoreceptors located within the avian lung. High fractions of inspired oxygen also contribute to hypoventilation, possibly by depressing oxygen-sensitive chemoreceptors.

Overall agreement of ICAGEN-Target ELISA and RIA was 85% (141/166). Agreement of ELISA and RIA at high (5 ng/ml or greater), medium (greater than 1 ng/ml, less than 5 ng/ml), and low (0 to 1 ng/ml) plasma progesterone concentrations was 96% (72/75), 73% (19/26), and 77% (50/65), respectively. Use of whole blood resulted in unreliable progesterone concentration results by ELISA when compared to plasma progesterone concentrations measured by RIA (n = 140). Use of this ELISA test kit to determine canine ovulation date should start within three to four days after onset of proestrus and continue every other day until the first detection of medium concentrations (greater than 1 ng/ml, less than 5 ng/ml). Daily plasma testing during the time of transition from medium to high (5 ng/ml or greater) concentrations was essential for determining ovulation date. The second or third day after the first appearance of high plasma progesterone concentrations using this kit should be the day of breeding for optimal reproductive performance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edetic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Evaluation Studies as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radioimmunoassay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reagent Kits, Diagnostic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vagina</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The IMT resolved with immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy. Histologic examination identified lymphangioma which was too extensive for surgical excision. The history and the clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with congenital vWD, although acquired vWD secondary to lymphangioma could not be ruled out.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Groin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphangioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytopenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vulvar Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>von Willebrand Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Preoperatively, 73% (19/26 eyes) of eyes with anterior luxations had secondary glaucoma compared to 43% (10/23 eyes) with subluxations and 38% (3/8 eyes) with posterior luxations. Forty-one of 57 eyes (72%) had vision and intraocular pressure (IOP) less than 30 mm Hg four to six weeks after surgery. This percentage declined to 61% (22/36 eyes) in three months and 53% (8/15 eyes) in 12 months. Eyes with glaucoma before ICLE had a lower success rate (66%) than eyes without (82%). Since secondary glaucoma was the most common cause of failure, this study suggests that removal of a subluxated lens or a posteriorly luxated lens should be recommended before the lens moves into the anterior chamber.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cataract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eye Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follow-Up Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glaucoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intraocular Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lens Subluxation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lens, Crystalline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retinal Detachment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The puppy was depressed, and pain could be elicited on palpation of both shoulders and hips. The most significant results of serum chemistries and hematology were hypercalcemia; increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase; and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Thoracic radiographs revealed a large thymic mass, diagnosed on histological examination as a thymic lymphoma. Radiographs of the shoulders revealed destructive bone lesions involving the proximal metaphyses of the humeri, causing slipped epiphyses. Bone lesions were found at necropsy on the proximal and distal aspects of both humeri and femurs. Bone resorption was due to local neoplastic infiltration and presumed humoral factors secreted locally and systemically by neoplastic thymic lymphocytes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Femoral Fractures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humeral Fractures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypercalcemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Concurrent arterial blood gas values were compared to determine the most consistent (repeatable) and accurate (compared to calculated hemoglobin saturations) pulse oximeter probe and probe placement sites for subsequent use in awake dogs. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation was determined from arterial blood gas analysis (SaO2) and by pulse oximetry (SpO2) at full hemoglobin saturation (mean, 99.5% SaO2) and at moderate desaturation (mean, 92.9% SaO2). Each probe was evaluated with three independent readings at seven different body sites (Achilles, ear, flank, lip, tail, toe, and tongue). Values for SpO2 obtained with the s probe demonstrated a significant correlation with SaO2 values (p = 0.014, R = 0.712) compared to the SpO2 values obtained with the f probe (p = 0.108). The best probe placement sites for the clip-on probes in this study were on the lip and tongue using the s probe; however, the ear, tail, and toe may be acceptable sites in awake dogs using a probe which maintains good contact across these vascular beds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Gas Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear, External</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Evaluation Studies as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemoglobins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lip</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oximetry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxygen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Regression Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tail</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tongue</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Epistaxis, sneezing, and ulceration or swelling of the nasal planum were the most common presenting complaints. Although no evidence of metastasis was identified, the primary tumor in all cases was locally invasive with extensive involvement of underlying tissues. Advanced imaging procedures performed in three cases indicated that physical examination may underestimate the local extent of the neoplasm.

In 36 patients, the catheters were used for daily anesthesia associated with cobalt radiotherapy, and in one dog the catheter was used for parenteral hyperalimentation. The catheters were in place for a mean of 16.7 days. Complications occurred in five patients and included infection or sepsis (n = 3), local abscess formation (n = 1), and local induration (n = 1); all the complications resolved with appropriate therapy. Broviac-Cooke catheters should be considered for use in dogs and cats requiring frequent blood sampling, repeated intravenous access, or in those for which routine venous access is difficult or impossible. The complication rate is minimal (13%) and is similar to that reported in studies of humans with indwelling, silastic catheters.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteremia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Catheterization, Central Venous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Catheters, Indwelling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dimethylpolysiloxanes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pseudomonas Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Silicones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The obstructions were believed to be anatomical rather than functional based on endoscopic examinations. Initially, the dogs had been evaluated and each had received two abdominal surgeries because of gastrointestinal bleeding, vomiting, or both. Eventually, both dogs were euthanized due to complications arising after attempted surgical correction of the iatrogenic obstructions. While gastric surgery commonly is performed, it seldom is considered to be a potentially harmful procedure. However, as these cases demonstrate, the decision to perform a gastrotomy must be weighed against possible risks and complications. Iatrogenic gastric outflow obstruction associated with surgery may be prevented by minimizing tissue inversion into the gastric lumen when surgery is performed near the pyloric outflow tract. Additionally, when large lesions near the pylorus are resected surgically, preservation of the continuity of the outflow tract is necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Duodenal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Duodenum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophagitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Outlet Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On surgical exploration and trephination, the left frontal sinus was filled with soft bone which contained multiple pockets of mucopurulent material. Cytologic examination confirmed the presence of a large number of neutrophils, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts; and both extracellular and intracellular, filamentous, beaded bacteria. The involved bone was debrided, and the defects in the orbital wall and sinus were reconstructed successfully with a temporalis muscle flap.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Exophthalmos</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Frontal Sinus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteomyelitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fourteen dogs ranged from five to 10 months of age; one dog was 42 months of age at the time of surgery. A combination of physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography, Doppler ultrasonography, and cardiac catheterization was used to establish a definitive diagnosis. Of the 15 dogs undergoing surgery for SAS, 13 had both two-dimensional (2-D) and M-mode echocardiographic examinations; three had successful Doppler aortic blood-flow studies; and five had successful cardiac catheterizations with selective ventricular angiography and intracardiac pressure measurements. In the five dogs undergoing preoperative catheterization, pressure gradient measurements across the aortic valve ranged from 58 to 130 mm Hg. Gradients were reduced by 55% (from 58 to 26 mm Hg), 54% (from 65 to 30 mm Hg), and 30% (from 93 to 65 mm Hg) in three dogs measured postsurgically at 2.5 months (n = 2) and four months (n = 1), respectively.

Abdominocentesis revealed a fluid with high protein (3.8 g/dl) and moderate cellularity. Infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic causes of posthepatic obstruction were ruled out. Partial obstruction and stenosis of the caudal vena cava (CVC) at the level of the diaphragm were detected on a contrast venogram. Exploratory surgery revealed a fibrous, web-like membrane at the site of obstruction. Resection of the stenotic segment of the CVC was not possible because of the junction of the left hepatic veins and CVC just caudal to the lesion. A 3 by 6-mm, oval Dacron patch graft was sutured into the venotomy site. Postoperative complications included fever and leukocytosis, eosinophilic pleural effusion, and transient congestive heart failure associated with volume overload. The cat is normal 16 months after surgery, with no recurrence of ascites. This is the first reported case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) in a domestic kitten. Documented herein is the first successful treatment of BCS in a small animal using a vascular, prosthetic patch graft.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Budd-Chiari Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Constriction, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vena Cava, Inferior</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The average age was 7.7 years, with the neutered male being the most common signalment (63%). Evidence of preexisting cardiac disease was noted in 11% of the cases. A murmur or arrhythmia was noted in 57% of the cases on presentation. Frequent laboratory abnormalities included elevations in blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Radiographic and electrocardiographic abnormalities were common (89% and 85%, respectively). The most frequent, underlying disease was hypertrophic feline cardiomyopathy (58%), with the left atrial size (as measured by M-mode) significantly increased in the majority of cases (mean left atrial-to-aortic ratio, 2.08). The average, long-term survival in the 37% of cases which survived the initial thromboembolic episode was 11.5 months.

The procedure was performed in six, fresh, canine cadavers and three canine patients diagnosed with neoplasia of the head. The relatively short, oblique incision and subsequent deeper dissection allowed surgical access to the three principal lymphocentrums with afferents from the head. There was no clinical evidence of negative side effects in patients receiving this surgery for lymph node staging. Histopathological evidence of metastasis was observed in at least one of the three lymphocentrums evaluated. Interestingly, lymph nodes (parotid and medial retropharyngeal) which would have been considered difficult to evaluate by fine-needle aspiration provided useful diagnostic and prognostic information. Based on the results of this study, the ipsilateral parotid, mandibular, and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes may be excised through a single incision in a safe and effective manner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Autopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Head and Neck Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymph Nodes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Maxillary Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mouth Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The most common presenting complaints were nasal discharge, including epistaxis; sneezing; and facial deformity or exophthalmos. Metastasis was not identified in any case, but bone lysis and invasion into tissues outside the nasal cavity were noted in five cases. Computed tomograms were performed in five cases and were more useful than radiographs in determining the extent of neoplastic involvement. Euthanasia was performed within one week of diagnosis in three cases at the owner's request; one case died at home within one month; and the remaining four cases were euthanized within eight months due to progressive clinical signs.

Relapse during the follow-up period of six-to-12 months occurred in two dogs, but licking stopped after brief retraining periods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electric Stimulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

While both collars were effective in decreasing barking (88.9% for the citronella spray collar and 44.4% for the electronic shock collar), most owners expressed a preference for the citronella spray collar. Owners perceived it as being more humane and indicated that they willingly would use it on a long-term basis to decrease their dogs' nuisance barking. While the citronella spray collar has some drawbacks, it is another tool for managing excessive barking.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Compulsive Behavior</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Consumer Behavior</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The medical records of 42 dogs treated for GDV between 1990 and 1994 were reviewed in an effort to evaluate the correlation between GDV and preexisting gastrointestinal disease. Twenty-three cases fit the inclusion criteria of an intestinal biopsy taken at the time of corrective surgery and a complete medical history. The microscopic jejunal changes expected from the acute vascular compromise in these animals were diffuse edema, dilatation of lymphatics with possible lymphangiectasia, mucosal degeneration, diapedesis of neutrophils, and rare hemorrhage. These changes were discounted. Of the 23 biopsies, 14 (61%) were consistent with the presence of an underlying inflammatory disease, and of these 14, 12 (86%) were accompanied by case histories of prior gastrointestinal disturbances. This study raises the possibility of an association between GDV and inflammatory bowel disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Jejunum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutrophils</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syndrome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thyroxine (T4) concentration after TRH stimulation was significantly lower than that obtained by TSH stimulation. It was not possible to identify hypothyroid dogs with the TRH-stimulation test, because some euthyroid dogs had either decreases in T4 or only slight increases in T4 concentrations after TRH stimulation. In addition, dogs with pyoderma had decreased responses in serum T4 after TRH stimulation, which became normal following treatment with antibiotics. Six of the 22 dogs were diagnosed as hypothyroid based on TSH results and responses to thyroid hormone replacement.

Mean serum FT4 concentration (68.3 +/- 26.8 pmol/L) of hyperthyroid cats was significantly higher than that of euthyroid cats (22.9 +/- 4.8 pmol/L). Reference values for basal FT4 of hyperthyroid and healthy cats were 33 to 114 pmol/L and 16 to 30 pmol/L, respectively. The results of the present study suggest that FT4 measured by chemiluminescence could be a useful alternative to TT4 measured by RIA when evaluating thyroid function in cats, since the hazardous effects of radioactive materials on the manipulators and the environment could be avoided.

Clinically, the Great Dane showed only mild discomfort, while the border collie exhibited tetraparesis due to cervicothoracic compression. Unusual features in the Great Dane were exostoses that bridged physes, with progression after skeletal maturity. The border collie puppy's exostoses resembled tumoral calcinosis radiographically. Limb exostoses in this puppy often were para-articular, and most were not attached to the underlying bone. These features resembled metachondromatosis in humans. Analysis of previously reported cases of multiple cartilaginous exostoses indicated that the prognosis is guarded to poor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone and Bones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Exostoses, Multiple Hereditary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These abnormalities improved over time in surviving dogs, supporting a causal relationship between anesthesia/surgery and exacerbation. Moderate myocardial failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmias of variable severity existed prior to anesthesia and surgery in each dog.

Congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve regurgitation had been diagnosed six weeks earlier. The dog was stable on furosemide, enalapril, and hydralazine. Complex ventricular tachycardia, altered QRS conformation of sinus complexes, echocardiographic evidence of a hypokinetic left-ventricular free wall, and elevated creatine kinase suggested a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the dog developed ventricular fibrillation and died 36 hours after admission. Postmortem examination confirmed the myocardial infarction.

The study population consisted of six adult, mixed-breed dogs. Catheter sizes evaluated were 16- and 19-gauge. Patient positions evaluated were right and left lateral recumbencies. Right atrial pressures (RAPs) were used as the reference standards for CVP measurements. Measurements of RAP and CVP were obtained with a water manometer and a strain-gauge transducer. No significant differences were observed in measured CVPs for the effects of catheter size and right versus left lateral recumbency.

An enlarged spinal canal from the twelfth thoracic (T12) vertebra to the third lumbar (L3) vertebra was identified on survey radiographs. An intradural-extramedullary cavity at the twelfth (T12) and thirteenth (T13) thoracic vertebrae, filled with contrast material, was demonstrated on myelography. A left-sided hemilaminectomy was performed over this region, and a subarachnoid cavitation or cyst was found to be the cause of the severe spinal-cord compression. The cyst was drained. The cat showed improvement in the neurological signs during the first three weeks postoperatively.

<Rec><Common><PMID>9138241</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Efficacy of hyposensitization in feline allergic diseases based upon results of in vitro testing for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E.</Title>	<Abstract>A survey was undertaken to evaluate the responses to hyposensitization in cats for which a diagnosis of allergic disease was made by assessment of clinical signs and evaluation of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) using the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). Eighty-one cases were available for analysis. In 39 cases, a dietary change resulted in some subjective improvement, which usually was minimal; however, some cases had significant improvement. In 75.3% of cases, an improvement of at least 50% was noted and ascribed to a combination of immunotherapy and dietary change, when implemented. The response of the 42 cases in which immunotherapy alone was used or where there was no response to dietary change was broadly similar. Response of the specific dermatological conditions ranged from 93.6% in the case of linear granuloma to 60% in cases where self-induced hair loss was evident. Response also was good in cases of presumed allergic asthma (86.1% improvement) and suspected allergic otitis externa (62.6% improvement). In nine patients, the hyposensitization was discontinued due to lack of response. The results suggest that confirmation of a suspected diagnosis of allergic disease in cats by means of in vitro tests and subsequent therapy with hyposensitization should be a major consideration in feline practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Desensitization, Immunologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Hypersensitivity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypersensitivity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulin E</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>In Vitro Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radioallergosorbent Test</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Postoperative survival time and prognostic indicators for survival were examined. Spinal neoplasms in dogs and humans also were compared. Thirty-seven cases with histologically confirmed spinal tumors were included in the study. The cervical region was affected most commonly, and 23 (62%) of 37 cases had extradural tumors. A hemilaminectomy or a dorsal laminectomy was performed in each case; three cases received adjuvant treatment. Twelve (32%) cases were euthanized at the time of surgery, and two died immediately after surgery. One dog was euthanized 20 days after surgery because of persistent clinical signs. Twenty-two cases were followed postoperatively; nine different types of primary tumors were confirmed by histological examination of tissue specimens from these 22 cases, and three cases had metastatic lesions. The median survival time of these 22 cases was 240 days. Twelve (32%) of the 37 cases had nerve-sheath tumors; the median survival time for these 12 cases was 180 days. No prognostic indicators were identified. However, median survival times of cases with benign versus malignant tumor types were 1,410 days and 180 days, respectively (p of 0.07). Four cases each had a myxoma/myxosarcoma, a tumor previously unreported in the spinal canal in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cervical Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myxoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nerve Sheath Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>New York</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracic Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bilateral lesions were seen in two dogs. The medial condyle was affected in five stifles, and the lateral condyle was affected in three stifles. Subchondral bone defects were identified on radiographs in six of eight affected stifles. Resolution of the lameness associated with the arthroscopic procedure occurred one-to-14 days (mean, three days) following arthroscopy. Lameness resolved completely in four cases within two weeks and in one case six weeks following arthroscopy. Mild lameness persisted in one case. Arthroscopy is an effective means of diagnosis and treatment of OCD of the femoral condyle, and it is associated with minimal postoperative morbidity when compared to arthrotomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthroscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Femur</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteochondritis Dissecans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In a minority of cases, histopathology has demonstrated suppurative leptomeningeal (i.e., arachnoid and pia) inflammation. A case of compressive, cervical, pyogranulomatous inflammation of undetermined cause affecting the dura mater (i.e., pachymeningitis), accompanied by fever and hyperpathia, is presented. The pachymeningitis ultimately regressed with long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This case shares features with hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis of humans, an uncommon, frequently idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder causing dural hypertrophy, radiculopathy, and spinal cord compression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dura Mater</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Compression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Part Two: Degenerative changes--nonchondrodystrophoid versus chondrodystrophoid disks.</Title>	<Abstract>In the second of a two-part article on the canine intervertebral disk, the morphological changes which occur within the disk during aging and degeneration are described. Degeneration of the intervertebral disk appears to be a self-perpetuating process as a consequence of disruption to the annulus fibrosus, cellular remodeling, altered biomechanical loading, and nutritional deficiencies. In the nonchondrodystrophoid disk, premature acceleration of the aging process can occur following traumatic disruption to the annulus fibrosus. This degeneration usually occurs in isolated disks along the length of the vertebral column. By contrast, disk degeneration in the chondrodystrophoid breeds occurs simultaneously in all disks along the vertebral column and usually is well advanced by two years of age. Ultrastructural differences between the intervertebral disk of the nonchondrodystrophoid dog and that of the chondrodystrophoid dog may explain the rapidity and severity of degenerative changes in the latter breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteochondrodysplasias</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Species Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All ferrets became laterally recumbent within two minutes following the administration of each drug combination. The tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol combination induced significantly longer (p less than 0.05) durations of tail clamp analgesia (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], 90.0 +/- 17.1 min versus 17.8 +/- 15.8 min and 41.9 +/- 26.3 min) and endotracheal intubation (mean +/- SD, 84.8 +/- 21.7 min versus 5.2 +/- 10.3 min and 26.3 +/- 29.8 min) than the low-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine and high-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine combinations, respectively. Heart rates and the times from dorsal recumbency to standing were not significantly different among the three treatment groups. However, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol group. Ventilatory function was more depressed in the tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol group than in the low-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine and high-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine groups. A short period of hypoxia was observed in the tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol-treated ferrets. Tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol was found to be the best of the three combinations evaluated in these ferrets. The addition of butorphanol to the low-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine combination greatly enhanced the duration of analgesia, endotracheal intubation, and dorsal recumbency. However, since hypoxemia occurred during the tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-butorphanol anesthesia, oxygen (O2) insufflation is recommended. Doubling the dose of the low-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine increased the duration of analgesia and endotracheal intubation without prolonging the recovery when compared to the low-dose tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine group.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Analgesics, Opioid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Combined</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Dissociative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Butorphanol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cohort Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferrets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypnotics and Sedatives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intramuscular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tiletamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Xylazine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zolazepam</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Glenohumeral stability results from several mechanisms, including those that do not require expenditure of energy by muscle ("passive mechanisms") and those that do ("active mechanisms"). Glenohumeral instability has been recognized in 47 shoulders of 45 dogs and one cat. Cases are presented because of chronic foreleg lameness. Shoulder joint pain is obviated by the orthopedic examination. Only 57% of the involved shoulders presented with degenerative joint disease. Signs of instability are recognized under anesthesia using a craniocaudal or mediolateral drawer sign or both. This report describes the radiographic and arthroscopic findings of shoulder instability. Arthroscopy of the shoulder joint allows identification of all intra-articular pathologies.

No cases of apnea were observed during induction of anesthesia. An adequate level of anesthesia was established in each protocol as judged by both the lack of response to mechanical noxious stimuli (i.e., tail clamping) and evidence of reduction in total amplitude of brain wave activity. The initial propofol-mediated decrease in arterial blood pressure continued during either halothane (52.4%) or isoflurane (38%) anesthesia without a simultaneous increase in heart rate. The results of this study suggest that propofol, in combination with inhalant agents, can be used effectively and safely for canine anesthesia in veterinary practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Analysis of Variance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia, Inhalation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Inhalation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carbon Dioxide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroencephalography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Halothane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoflurane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxygen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Propofol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tidal Volume</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Three puppies developed FN. Proteinuria, which began when these puppies were five-to-eight months old, was the first abnormality detected. Proteinuria persisted while each puppy's growth rate slowed, and renal function gradually deteriorated. The interval from onset of proteinuria to development of azotemia was two-to-nine months. Characteristic glomerular capillary basement membrane (GCBM) lesions were seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of renal biopsy specimens obtained during this interval. Ultrastructural GCBM lesions progressed substantially during the interval from biopsy to necropsy. However, routine light microscopic findings did not allow definitive diagnosis of FN in either biopsy or necropsy specimens. Detection of FN can be accomplished by screening at-risk ECSs for proteinuria. Renal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis in dogs for which proteinuria cannot be explained otherwise. Percutaneous needle biopsy specimens sufficient for TEM must be used to examine the GCBM to make a definitive diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Basement Membrane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heterozygote</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Glomerulus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microscopy, Electron</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteinuria</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A hemogram indicated an inflammatory leukogram and a regenerative anemia with spherocytosis and thrombocytosis. The dog responded well to conservative therapy for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). However, the thrombocytosis did not resolve. Serial hemograms were characterized by persistent thrombocytosis (platelet count, 577,000 to 1,200,000/microl) with abnormal platelet morphology. A systematic investigation ruled out causes of physiological and reactive thrombocytoses. A diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia was made by fulfilling the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group of the National Cancer Institute. The marked thrombocytosis was nonresponsive to hydroxyurea therapy. The dog remains healthy despite the marked increase in the number of circulating platelets.

The most common postoperative complication is hypocalcemia due to disruption of the parathyroid glands. When parathyroid gland disruption is obvious, many authors suggest autotransplantation (AT) of the glands. This technique never has been supported by a scientific study which monitored postoperative calcium or parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. Cats in this study each underwent bilateral thyroidectomy and parathyroid AT to mimic a clinical situation. Serum calcium concentrations normalized much quicker than concentrations in previously reported cats undergoing bilateral thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy.

The average number of ribs resected in cases of thoracic wall neoplasia (with and without mass recurrence) was 1.8 and 3.5, respectively.

Time from injection to assuming lateral recumbency was not significantly different between the three drugs. Duration of recumbency expressed as mean+/-standard deviation was significantly longer with xylazine (68.3+/-20.8 min) than with diazepam (43.2+/-8.2 min) or acepromazine (49.8+/-11.2 min).

Specific aims included documenting the time of and extent of improved limb function as measured by force plate analysis, evaluating the progression of degenerative joint disease (DJD) in the treated and untreated coxofemoral joints, and determining whether or not triple pelvic osteotomy resulted in degenerative joint changes in the ipsilateral stifle and hock. Twelve dogs were treated unilaterally and nine dogs were treated bilaterally with triple pelvic osteotomies. There were no differences in mean anteversion angles, angles of inclination, or preoperative DJD between treated hips and untreated hips. Degenerative joint disease progressed significantly in all hips regardless of treatment. Two cases developed hyperextension of their hocks after the triple pelvic osteotomies. However, no radiographic evidence of DJD was observed for any of the stifles or hocks at any observation time. A significant increase in vertical peak force (VPF) scores was noted for treated legs by two-to-three months after surgery, which continued over time. Untreated legs did not show a significant change in VPF scores over time.

Trauma was the most common cause (84.6%), including blunt abdominal trauma (59.1%), urethral catheterization (31.8%), and bladder expression (9.1%). The bladder was the most frequent site of urine leakage following blunt abdominal trauma (84.6%), while the urethra was the most common site following catheterization (71.4%). Common historical complaints were anuria (53.8%) and vomiting (50%). On physical examination, the bladders were palpable in nine (69%) of 13 cases; four of the nine had ruptured bladders. The ability to urinate did not exclude a diagnosis of UP since four noncatheterized cases reportedly urinated. Twenty-five cases were azotemic on presentation. The creatinine or potassium (K+) concentration in the serum compared to that in the peritoneal effusion (mean ratio, 1:2 and 1:1.9, respectively) was a useful indicator for UP. When performed, positive contrast radiography was diagnostic. Drainage of urine from the peritoneal cavity appeared to improve patient stabilization. Morbidity and mortality depended largely on the severity of associated injuries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Urea Nitrogen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritoneal Dialysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Examination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Catheterization</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Considering a total of 8,087 dogs and 8,702 cats undergoing anesthesia, the incidences of complications were 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively. Death occurred in 0.11% and 0.1% of cases, respectively. Logistic regression models were developed and showed that a significant odds ratio (OR) of complications in dogs was associated with xylazine (OR, 91.5); heart rate monitoring (OR, 3.2); American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 3, 4, or 5 classification (OR, 2.5); isoflurane (OR, 2.4); butorphanol (OR, 0.35); technician presence (OR, 0.26); acepromazine (OR, 0.24); ketamine (OR, 0.21); and mask induction (OR, 0.2). Complications in cats were associated with ASA 3, 4, or 5 classification (OR, 5.3); diazepam (OR, 4.1); intubation (OR, 1.7); butorphanol (OR, 0.45); and ketamine (OR, 0.17). Cardiac arrest in dogs was associated with xylazine (OR, 43.6) and ASA 3, 4, or 5 classification (OR, 7.1). Cardiac arrest in cats was associated with ASA 3, 4, or 5 classification (OR, 21.6) and technician presence (OR, 0.19). This paper reports the incidences of complications and cardiac arrest in small animal practice and identifies common complications and factors that may influence anesthetic morbidity and mortality. This information may be useful in comparing anesthetic management practices.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Arrest</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Monitoring, Physiologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Morbidity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ontario</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Preanesthetic Medication</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Puppies were studied at four, six-to-10, 16-to-18, and 52 weeks of age. The purpose of this study was to compare palpation and radiographic methods of hip laxity detection in puppies for predicting the development of degenerative joint disease (DJD) by one year of age. Twenty-seven (42%) hips developed DJD. Ortolani's method was not a reliable predictor of hip dysplasia at six-to-10 weeks; it was significantly predictive at 16-to-18 weeks but had a high incidence of false negatives. Bardens' and subjective (OFA) assessment methods were not reliable at six-to-10 or 16-to-18 weeks. Radiographic measurements taken with femurs in a neutral position and hips distracted (distraction index [DI] and Norberg angle) and measurements taken with femurs extended in OFA position (Norberg angle) of six- to 10-week-old puppies accurately predicted DJD occurrence by one year of age (p less than 0.01). Distraction index measurement (PennHIP method) was the most accurate in predicting the development of DJD (p less than 0.001). Distraction index radiography in puppies six-to-10 and 16-to-18 weeks of age was the most reliable predictor of hip dysplasia. Norberg angle measurement was more reliable during hip distraction than when hips were measured in the OFA position in 16- to 18-week-old puppies, but had similar reliability in six- to 10-week-old puppies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hip Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Instability</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palpation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All of the ferrets became laterally recumbent following the administration of each drug combination. The xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine combination induced significantly longer (p less than 0.05) durations of tail-clamp analgesia (mean+/-standard deviation [SD], 81.0+/-19.1 min versus 20.5+/-25.4 min and 30.0+/-26.9 min), dorsal recumbency (mean+/-SD, 94.6+/-13.6 min versus 75. 6+/-34.7 min and 55.2+24.8 min), and muscle relaxation suitable for endotracheal intubation (mean+/-SD, 67.1+/-23.0 min versus 7.0+/-22.1 min and 9.5+/-15.4 min) than the diazepam-butorphanol-ketamine and acepromazine-butorphanol-ketamine combinations, respectively. The recovery time from dorsal recumbency to standing was not significantly different among the three treatment groups. The heart rate was significantly lower in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine group; however, systolic blood pressure was not significantly different among the treatment groups. Ventilatory function was more depressed in the diazepam-butorphanol-ketamine and xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine groups than in the acepromazine-butorphanol-ketamine group. A period (approximately 45 minutes) of hypoxia was observed in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine-treated ferret. Of the three combinations evaluated in ferrets, xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine was concluded to be the most effective anesthetic combination. However, hypoxemia and ventricular arrhythmias were observed in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine-treated ferrets, so the effectiveness of the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine combination should be weighed against its cardiorespiratory side effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acepromazine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Analgesics, Opioid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Combined</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Dissociative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Butorphanol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diazepam</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferrets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypnotics and Sedatives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ketamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Xylazine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An inflammatory leukogram and elevated serum amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transferase, and triglycerides supported a diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis. An enlarged, hypoechoic pancreas was visualized on abdominal ultrasonography. The patient clinically responded to medical therapy consisting of nothing per os, total parenteral nutrition, and supportive care. She presented again three weeks later with anorexia and vomiting. A large, anechoic mass was seen in the left limb of the pancreas on ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen. Differentials for this mass included abscess, focal peritonitis, and pancreatic pseudocyst. Clinical signs resolved with supportive care. The mass failed to resolve. Sterile fluid (35 ml) was removed via ultrasonographic-guided centesis 42 days after initial presentation. Ultrasonographic appearance, biochemical analyses, and fluid examination with negative cultures suggested pancreatic pseudocyst.

The prevalence of sinus tachycardia and increased R-wave voltage in lead II were both lower in the 1993 population compared with the 1982 population (p less than 0.001). A low frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and intraventricular conduction abnormalities were recorded in both populations. No significant differences between populations were recorded in the number of cats with mild, moderate, and severe cardiomegaly seen on thoracic radiographs. The percentage of cats in which radiographs were deemed clinically necessary based upon history and clinical examination was 25% of the 1993 population, compared with 63% of the 1982 population. The number of cats with radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure was 8% in 1993 compared with 20% in 1982, although this difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the incidence and severity of certain thyrotoxic cardiovascular manifestations were reduced in cats diagnosed between 1992 and 1993 compared with those diagnosed between 1979 and 1982.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiomegaly</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Failure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperthyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cases presented to the Animal Behavior Clinic at Cornell University between 1987 and 1996 were reviewed. Of 1,173 cases, 105 (9%) were house-soiling cases. Of these cases, the authors obtained outcome information from 70. Within the diagnosis of house soiling, incomplete housebreaking (n=59; 84%) were the most frequent referral cases, of which 48 cases (81%; 95% confidence interval, 69% to 90%) improved. Separation anxiety was considered the second most common underlying cause (n=27; 39%), of which 85% (n=23; 95% confidence interval, 66% to 96%) improved. Behavior modification was the most often suggested treatment (n=58), with 48 (83%) cases improving. Behavior modification consisted of accompanying the dog to the preferred elimination area, rewarding the dog for eliminating there, and punishing the dog only when caught in the act of house soiling. These results suggest that correct house training, behavior modification involving positive reinforcement, and appropriate punishment are essential to diminish house-soiling problems in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eliminative Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The dog was treated for the acute effects of craniocerebral trauma and was hospitalized for just over a week. Several weeks later, she became weak and lethargic. A diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism was confirmed with an adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. An endogenous ACTH assay confirmed secondary hypoadrenocorticism. The dog was tested for hypopituitarism with canine thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine serum assays and an insulin-like growth factor assay. These tests could not confirm panhypopituitarism in this dog. The hypoadrenocorticism was treated with prednisone, and the dog remains controlled adequately three years later.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parietal Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skull Fractures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

"Hit by car" (HBC) was the most common inciting cause, and the axis and atlas were the vertebrae most frequently affected. Surgical treatment was associated with high (36%) perioperative mortality. However, all dogs that survived the perioperative period achieved functional recovery. Functional recovery was achieved in 25 (89%) of 28 nonsurgically treated dogs with adequate follow-up. Overall, severity of neurological deficits (nonambulatory status) and prolonged interval (five days or longer) from trauma to referral were associated with poorer outcome. Nonsurgical treatment is a viable therapeutic approach for many dogs with cervical fractures. Early neck immobilization and prompt referral are recommended, because delay in referral decreases the likelihood of functional recovery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Accidents, Traffic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cervical Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recovery of Function</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Fractures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bilateral adrenal tumors were diagnosed in three of 15 dogs, and unilateral tumors were diagnosed in 12 of 15 dogs. Adrenal tumors were characterized by adrenal gland enlargement with loss of the normal shape and parenchymal structure. The contralateral adrenal gland could be imaged in all dogs with unilateral tumors. Based on size, shape, and parenchymal structure, the contralateral adrenal gland was similar to adrenal glands of normal dogs. The results of this study show that: 1) both adrenal glands should be imaged routinely in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism; 2) bilateral adrenocortical tumors seem to be more frequent than previously assumed; 3) one normal adrenal gland does not exclude the existence of a contralateral FAT; and 4) the functional atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland in dogs with FAT may not be apparent ultrasonographically.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenal Glands</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Measurements of adrenal glands were obtained in six dogs with hypoadrenocorticism. The adrenal glands on both sides were shorter (range: left adrenal gland length, 10.0 to 19.7 mm; right adrenal gland length, 9.5 to 18.8 mm) and thinner (range: left adrenal gland thickness, 2.2 to 3.0 mm; right adrenal gland thickness, 2.2 to 3.4 mm) than in normal dogs (range: left adrenal gland length, 13.2 to 26.3 mm; right adrenal gland length, 12.4 to 22.6 mm; left adrenal gland thickness, 3.0 to 5.2 mm; right adrenal gland thickness, 3.1 to 6.0 mm). Statistical analysis revealed a significant reduction in size of the left adrenal gland (p less than 0.05) in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism compared to the left adrenal gland in normal dogs. The results of this study show that atrophy of the adrenal glands in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism seems to lead to an ultrasonographic-measurable reduction in size of the adrenal glands.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Glands</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenal Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atrophy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The dog presented with purulent nasal and ocular discharges, skin lesions (including seborrhea, hyperkeratotic areas, and papules as well as ecchymoses around the eyes, on both sides of the pinnae, and on the vulva), generalized lymph node enlargement, a mitral murmur, and lameness. Later, facial swelling, a retrobulbar abscess, and a cough also developed. Occurrence of a generalized bacterial infection was established by culture of group-C, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus from the throat, the mouth, a biopsy site (popliteal lymph node area), the retrobulbar abscess, and the lung. The diagnosis of SLE was based on the clinical signs and particularly on the occurrence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antidoublestranded-desoxyribonucleic acid (ds-DNA) antibody. Interestingly, the latter type of antibodies were also detected in two young female puppies whelped by this dog. Salient histological findings included an extreme cell depletion of the lymph nodes and spleen and severe pneumonitis and peribronchiolitis. The results of this case indicate that a definite diagnosis of canine SLE can, at times, be made on the basis of the presence of serum ANA and ds-DNA antibodies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Antinuclear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcal Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Therefore, due to a high individual variability of echocardiographic measurements in adult Irish wolfhounds, the predictive value of body weight for echocardiographic measurements was clinically not relevant. Sex had no influence on echocardiographic values.

Compared to normal cats, the HCM group showed significantly (p value less than 0.05) reduced early LV inflow velocities (mean +/- standard error [SE], peak velocity of 0.70+/-0.04 m/s versus 0.54+/-0.04 m/s and integrated velocity of 0.48+/-0.08 m/s versus 0.37+/-0.03 m/s); a reduced rate of deceleration of early inflow (mean+/-SE, -12.0+/-1.0 m/s2 versus -5.1+/-1.1 m/s2); prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (mean +/- SE, 45.7+/-3.3 ms versus 76.0+/-3.1 ms); and increased atrial systolic flow velocities (mean +/- SE, peak velocity of 0.29+/-0.04 m/s versus 0.48+/-0.04 m/s and integrated velocity of 0.21+/-0.03 m/s versus 0.34+/-0.03 m/s). The results suggest that PD provides a noninvasive method of identifying and quantifying functional diastolic impairment in cats with HCM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diastole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography, Doppler, Color</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ventricular Function, Left</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal exploration revealed an intact diaphragm, but thoracic exploration revealed a large mass originating from the diaphragm. Resection of the mass was incomplete and required reconstruction of the diaphragm. On histopathology, the mass was composed mainly of spindle-shaped cells with occasional areas of osseous and chondroid tissue. The tumor was diagnosed as a peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) with chondro-osseous differentiation. The dog was released four days after surgery; however, she began having difficulty breathing seven days after discharge, and the owners elected euthanasia. A necropsy was not performed.

A retrospective case-control study was conducted to determine the postoperative outcome of this subset of dogs in the authors' neurosurgical practice. Medical records (1985 through 1996) were reviewed for dogs with caudal lumbar disk herniation confirmed at surgery. Thirty-six cases were identified. For each case, two dogs that underwent surgical treatment for upper motor neuron thoracolumbar disk herniation (tenth thoracic [T10] to L3 intervertebral spaces) were selected as controls. Probabilities of functional recovery for cases and controls were 81% and 85%, respectively (p value of 0.49). In dogs with caudal lumbar disk herniation, complete sensorimotor loss was the only significant predictor of functional recovery (p value of 0.005). Disk herniations that occur at the thoracolumbar junction and those that occur in the caudal lumbar region should not be considered to be different in terms of surgical treatment and postoperative outcome. The lower motor neuron signs that often accompany caudal lumbar disk herniation reflect the site of spinal cord injury and do not necessarily predict a poor prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recovery of Function</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study evaluates survival and mortality in a large group of dogs with IMHA. The association of age, sex, and breed with IMHA was evaluated by comparing affected dogs to control dogs admitted to the hospital during the same time period. Treatment regimens were reviewed to determine the effects of different agents upon survival of dogs with IMHA during hospitalization and after discharge. Median survival times for each treatment group were 57 days (prednisone), 28 days (prednisone, cyclophosphamide), 974 days (prednisone, azathioprine), 15 days (prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine), and one day (no treatment). Overall mortality rate in the population of dogs studied was 70%. Twenty-nine (41.4%) dogs either died or were euthanized while hospitalized. Forty-one (59%) dogs were discharged from the hospital. Of the dogs discharged, 10 died within the first month, another five died within three months, and another five died within a year of discharge due to assumed complications of therapy or relapses of IMHA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Azathioprine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Four of the five dogs were concurrently treated with pyridostigmine. Azathioprine was used as the sole immunosuppressive agent in four dogs. One dog was temporarily treated with a combination of an immunosuppressive dose of prednisone and AZA, then maintained on AZA as the sole immunosuppressive drug. Three patients experienced complete remission of clinical signs within three months of therapy. In the four dogs for which follow-up serum ACh receptor antibody concentrations were available, initial versus final concentrations decreased substantially (81%), coincident with clinical improvement. One dog died suddenly due to a suspected myasthenic crisis before attaining the target dose of AZA. Two of the four surviving dogs were euthanized approximately one and seven years after diagnosis. One of these two dogs was euthanized because of a rib osteosarcoma, and the other dog was euthanized because of paraparesis of undetermined cause. The remaining two dogs were alive and doing well at the time of final follow-up evaluation, approximately six months and one year after diagnosis.

It is important to include nasopharyngeal disease in the differential diagnosis for cats with nasal discharge, sneeze, stertor, or phonation change.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasopharyngeal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palpation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyps</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Sounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sneezing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Voice Disorders</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The cat had a marked thrombocytopenia, and a bone-marrow core biopsy demonstrated megakaryocytic hyperplasia with many megakaryocyte-associated neutrophils (i.e., emperipolesis). On peripheral blood, collected at initial presentation, what appeared to be platelets were noted to be within or adherent to occasional neutrophils. The thrombocytopenia was idiopathic in that no definitive cause could be found. However, platelet concentrations appeared to increase and decrease in response to changes in prednisone and cyclosporine therapy, suggesting a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis. As tests to detect increased feline platelet-associated antibodies are unavailable, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia can only be tentatively diagnosed in cats by exclusion and response to therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Marrow</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematocrit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Diagnostics, including thoracic radiographs, electrocardiography, and echocardiography revealed no cardiovascular anomalies. Thoracic radiographs revealed multifocal pulmonary lesions consistent with neoplasia. Complete blood cell count demonstrated a marked thrombocytosis, leukopenia, and neutropenia. Histopathology of the pulmonary lesions confirmed multiple bronchoalveolar carcinomas. Myelodysplasia with megakaryocytic hyperplasia and ineffective myelopoiesis was noted on bone-marrow histopathology from multiple sites. The absence of other causes suggested a paraneoplastic thrombocytosis. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic thrombocytosis-induced thromboembolism was made due to the lack of underlying cardiac disease and the presence of a marked thrombocytosis.

History, laboratory findings, and onset of neurological signs following correction of hyponatremia led to a diagnosis of myelinolysis. Myelinolysis is a noninflammatory, demyelinating brain disease caused by sudden, upward osmotic shifts in central nervous system plasma, often a result of rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. The pathogenesis is complex, but recovery is possible. Iatrogenic damage due to myelinolysis can be avoided by adherence to therapeutic guidelines for correction of chronic hyponatremia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyponatremia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infusions, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myelinolysis, Central Pontine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Saline Solution, Hypertonic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trichuriasis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Hypoglycemia with concomitant hyperinsulinemia suggested an insulin-secreting tumor. Pancreatic masses were resected, and insulinoma was diagnosed. Six weeks later, the dog presented in hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic crisis (HHC). The dog was initially stabilized with intravenous dextrose boluses and infusions, but seizure activity recurred and persisted. A glucagon constant-rate infusion (GCRI) was initiated, and neurological signs quickly resolved. Dextrose was withdrawn over 24 hours, and euglycemia was maintained by GCRI alone. Despite aggressive medical management including the use of prednisone, diazoxide, bovine somatotropin, and streptozocin, the dog presented on two subsequent occasions in HHC and both times was rapidly stabilized with GCRI alone. In this dog, GCRI was a fast, safe, and effective method of achieving and maintaining euglycemia despite intractable hyperinsulinism.

Records and myelograms or epidurograms of 27 patients were obtained from five colleges of veterinary medicine. Fifteen cases (56%) were evaluated as having some degree of spinal cord compression. The majority (73.3%) of the cases had only soft tissue as the compressive mass. The median compression for all cases was 5% of the vertebral canal. No difference was noted for compression based on anatomical site (i.e., cervical versus thoracolumbar versus lumbosacral). No significant correlation between degree of lesion compression and clinical outcome was noted, but there was a trend toward increased mortality with greater compression. There was no correlation between the ambulatory status and the ultimate outcome. Three of the 15 (20%) cases showed vertebral subluxation. Results of this study indicate that static spinal cord compression is not a significant component of the neurological dysfunction associated with bacterial discospondylitis. Identification of vertebral subluxation in some patients may indicate a dynamic lesion that should be evaluated with stress radiography.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Discitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Compression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spondylitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At surgery, a large, fluid-filled cystic structure was found within the pericardium. The cystic structure was continuous with a pedicle of liver that passed through a small peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia. Surgical resolution was achieved by median sternotomy, midline pericardotomy, resection of the cyst, and diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiac Tamponade</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Cyst</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pleural, pericardial, and abdominal effusion were identified with radiographs and ultrasound. Pericardiocentesis relieved signs of tamponade, and the dog was clinically improved. Pericardial effusion recurred, and pericardiectomy was performed. Histopathological examination of excised tissues failed to reveal evidence of infectious or neoplastic disease. After pericardiectomy, clinically apparent thoracic effusion persisted. The dog was euthanized, and postmortem histopathological examination revealed emboli of metastatic carcinoma cells in the epicardium.

Abnormalities were found in 209 (41.8%) of the dogs examined. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was diagnosed in 121 (24.2%) of the dogs and was accompanied by atrial fibrillation in 106 dogs. Seventeen dogs were suffering from advanced congestive heart failure (CHF), and 55 dogs were suffering from mild to moderate CHF as a result of DCM. Congestive heart failure was most commonly characterized by mild to severe pleural effusion due to right-sided heart failure in addition to pulmonary edema. Rhythm disturbances without evidence of DCM were detected in 48 dogs. Forty dogs had echocardiographic abnormalities without signs of DCM. Soft to moderate mitral regurgitations were diagnosed in 13 (2.6%) of these 40 dogs examined. In 39 dogs that died as a result of DCM, the median survival time from the time of diagnosis was 5.1 months, and in 59 dogs with DCM that are still alive, the median survival time is 15.7 months.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiomyopathy, Dilated</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography, Doppler, Color</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Germany</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An acquired III/VI holosystolic heart murmur was ausculted in the mitral area, and valvular endocarditis with pulmonic and aortic insufficiency were noted at echocardiographic examination. An abnormal communication (i.e., fistula) between the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the left atrium adjacent to the mitral valve annulus was noted with Doppler imaging and confirmed with angiography. Infective valvular endocarditis was confirmed based on two of three blood cultures being positive for Staphylococcus intermedius. In humans, a sequela to infective endocarditis of the aortic or mitral valve, or both, is rupture of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa, resulting in a communication between the LVOT and the left atrium.

The dog had a palpable abdominal mass and persistent thrombocytopenia due to a thrombosed caudal vena cava that was surgically removed. A few days after its removal, the dog died and neoplastic cells of neural crest origin were identified at the edge of the thrombus. Massive thrombosis can be an unusual cause of platelet consumption, leading to thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Deep vein thrombosis of the vena cava can occur in dogs and may mimic an abdominal mass. Multiple mechanisms may be involved in the development of venous thrombosis, including endothelial damage by neoplastic cells and the presence of a hypercoagulable state secondary to neoplasia. Extensive collateral circulation may allow removal of diseased vena cava.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melanoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms, Unknown Primary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplastic Cells, Circulating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytopenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vena Cava, Inferior</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Venous Thrombosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Needle-core specimens obtained before surgical biopsy were submitted to a single pathologist who evaluated both samples and was blinded to the results of surgical biopsy when evaluating the Trucut specimen. The results indicate that needle-core biopsy can accurately predict surgical biopsy. Thus, needle-core biopsy performed before surgical excision of masses can facilitate planning and reduce the need for numerous surgical procedures. Needle-core biopsy can direct appropriate treatment of nonmalignant masses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twelve cats with naturally occurring hyperthyroidism and 10 clinically normal (i.e., control) cats were included in this study. All cats initially were evaluated with a history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, basal serum total thyroxine concentration, complete urinalysis, and urine bacterial culture. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by a plasma iohexol clearance (PIC) test. After initial evaluation, hyperthyroid cats were treated with methimazole until euthyroidism was achieved. Both groups of cats were then reevaluated by repeating the initial tests four to six weeks later. The mean (+/-standard deviation) pretreatment estimated GFR for the hyperthyroid cats was significantly higher (3.83+/-1.82 ml/kg per min) than that of the control cats (1.83+/-0.56 ml/kg per min). Control of the hyperthyroidism resulted in a significantly decreased mean GFR of 2.02+/-0.81 ml/kg per minute when compared to pretreatment values. In the hyperthyroid group, the mean increases in serum urea nitrogen (SUN) and creatinine concentrations and the mean decrease in the urine specific gravity after treatment were not statistically significant when compared to pretreatment values. Two of the 12 hyperthyroid cats developed abnormally high serum creatinine concentrations following treatment. These results provide evidence that cats with hyperthyroidism have increased GFR compared to normal cats, and that treatment of feline hyperthyroidism with methimazole results in decreased GFR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antithyroid Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Urea Nitrogen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glomerular Filtration Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperthyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methimazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Specific Gravity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroxine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cats identified had contrast esophagrams performed during a six-year period. Of 56 cases undergoing esophagography, 51 had complete records available for review. Forty-four cases were felt to be abnormal and were included in the study. Cases were analyzed for signalment, presenting complaints, and identifiable causes of abnormal esophageal motility. Response to treatment and case outcome were also reviewed. The signalment of the cases varied widely, especially in age. The occurrence of esophageal motility dysfunction was low, comprising only 0.05% of all feline cases seen in a six-year period. Forty-three percent of cases were considered idiopathic, and 57% were congenital or diagnosed with conditions known to cause esophageal motility dysfunction. The causative disease states included myasthenia gravis, mediastinal masses, vascular ring anomalies, dysautonomia, and esophageal stricture. Seventy-eight percent of those treated with medical therapy (i.e., combinations of sucralfate, H2 receptor antagonists, and either metoclopramide or cisapride) showed clinical improvement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Boston</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Motility Disorders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Data from 807 cesarean-derived litters (3,908 puppies) was submitted by 109 practices in the United States and Canada. Survival rates immediately, two hours, and seven days after delivery were 92% (n=3,127), 87% (n=2,951), and 80% (n=2,641), respectively, for puppies delivered by cesarean section (n=3,410) and were 86% (n=409), 83% (n=366), and 75% (n=283), respectively, for puppies born naturally (n=498). Maternal mortality rate was 1% (n=9). Of 776 surgeries, 453 (58%) were done on an emergency basis. The most common breed of dog was bulldog (n=138; 17%). The most common methods of inducing and maintaining anesthesia were administration of isoflurane for induction and maintenance (n=266; 34%) and administration of propofol for induction followed by administration of isoflurane for maintenance (n=237; 30%). A model of cesarean-derived puppies surviving to birth, between birth and two hours, and between two hours and seven days was designed to relate litter survival to perioperative factors. The following factors increased the likelihood of all puppies being alive: the surgery was not an emergency; the dam was not brachycephalic; there were four puppies or less in the litter; there were no naturally delivered or deformed puppies; all puppies breathed spontaneously at birth; at least one puppy vocalized spontaneously at birth; and neither methoxyflurane nor xylazine was used in the anesthetic protocol.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Canada</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fetal Death</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perioperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Calvarial hyperostotic syndrome clinically resembles canine craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO) and human infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH), but it is unique in that there is progressive and often asymmetric skull bone involvement, and the population affected appears to be only young, male bullmastiff dogs. Characteristic radiographic findings consist of cortical thickening of the calvaria with irregular, bony proliferation over the frontal, temporal, and occipital bones. Histopathological examination shows that the trabeculae of the calvarial diplo&#235; are thickened and contiguous with a sunburst-like pattern of subperiosteal trabeculae composed of woven and lamellar bone tissue, accompanied by loose fibrovascular tissue and a variable inflammatory response comprised predominantly of neutrophils. In 80% of the cases presented, the lesion was self-limiting. The etiology remains unknown; however, traumatic, neoplastic, and degenerative conditions do not appear to be primary factors in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome.

The patients were assessed for postoperative pain using a subjective pain score and given oxymorphone (0.1 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly) every four hours if the pain score was 2 or greater. Blood samples were also collected to determine serum cortisol levels. There was a significant increase in serum cortisol levels in the immediate postoperative period in both the placebo group and the carprofen group (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in the percentage of increase in serum cortisol levels between the two groups. No correlation was evident between the serum cortisol levels and the corresponding pain scores in either group. This subjective method of assessing postoperative pain was not accurate and should not be relied upon for determination of postoperative analgesic administration. Perioperative oral administration of carprofen did not appear to be effective in controlling postoperative pain in these patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carbazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rupture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Acetabular osteotomies were repaired using the screw/wire/polymethylmethacrylate (SWP) composite fixation with or without one of three configurations of Kirschner wire in 32 hemipelves obtained from 16 dogs. Reduction, assessed objectively and subjectively, was unaffected by Kirschner wire placement. Hemipelves repaired with Kirschner wire(s) were subjectively more stable prior to application of polymethylmethacrylate when manually assessed in multiple planes. Consistent incremental increases in stiffness, yield load, and maximum load sustained that were observed during biomechanical testing were not significant, with the exception that hemipelves repaired with two Kirschner wires had significantly greater yield loads than hemipelves repaired without Kirschner wires. The subjective results of this study support the use of at least one interfragmentary Kirschner wire to maintain reduction prior to polymethylmethacrylate application; however, fracture configuration and location may dictate the number and pattern of interfragmentary Kirschner wires used to maintain reduction prior to application of the polymethylmethacrylate. The objective results and observations made during biomechanical testing suggest that use of one or more interfragmentary Kirschner wires may enhance stability after polymethylmethacrylate application.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acetabulum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Wires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Internal Fixators</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polymethyl Methacrylate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Extraskeletal OSA sites included subcutaneous sites (n=44), with an apparent prevalence for sites commonly used for vaccination. Other locations included ocular/orbital (n=4), oral (n=3), intestinal/omental (n=3), and mammary sites (n=1). Survival data was available for 74 cases. When considered as a group, cats with either appendicular (mean, 11.8 mos) or extraskeletal (mean, 12.67 mos) OSA survived longer than those with axial (mean, 6.07 mos) OSA.

Measurements of serum LH concentrations allowed for the identification of the LH surge and the optimal time for artificial insemination (AI). Nine out of the 12 beagles became pregnant through AI and completed a gestation. Shrinkage in the horizontal dimensions of the vulva (i.e., vulvar shrinkage) was primarily observed prior and subsequent to the LH surge. In six of the nine (66.7%) beagles that became pregnant, vulvar shrinkage was observed on the days in which the LH surge was confirmed, and the rate of vulvar shrinkage tended to be greater at higher serum LH concentrations. Further vulvar shrinkage was identified in all nine beagles within two days of the LH surge. An increase in the serum progesterone concentration was observed after the LH surge in each of the beagles that became pregnant, together with clinical signs of estrous behavior (i.e., standing heat) as well as a change in vulva condition from swollen to soft. This demonstrates that vulvar shrinkage is induced in response to the onset of the LH surge and that the LH surge can be predicted through the measurement of the horizontal dimensions of the vulva, vaginal cytology, and the assessment of serum progesterone concentrations in beagles.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insemination, Artificial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Luteinizing Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vulva</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Historical, physical examination, and laboratory abnormalities were reviewed. Diagnostic criteria included a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Rickettsia rickettsii (R. rickettsii) (n=15) or a single R. rickettsii antibody titer of 1:1,024 or greater (n=15; when this initial titer was determined one week or more after the onset of clinical signs). Fifteen (50%) dogs were greater than seven years of age, and 13 (43%) dogs were between two and seven years of age. There was no sex predilection. Only five (17%) dogs had a history of known tick exposure. Presumably due to delayed diagnosis, dogs with antibody titers of 1:1,024 or greater at the time of presentation had a higher incidence of more severe neurological dysfunction (e.g., ataxia, hyperesthesia, vestibular disease, and seizures) and cutaneous lesions (e.g., hyperemia, edema, petechiae, ecchymoses, and necrosis). Laboratory findings included anemia, leukocytosis accompanied by toxic granulation of neutrophils, hypoalbuminemia, and coagulation abnormalities; signs were generally more severe in the 15 dogs with R. rickettsii antibody titers of 1:1,024 or greater at the time of presentation. Twelve (40%) dogs in this study were severely thrombocytopenic (less than 75 x10(3) platelets/microl; reference range, 200 to 450 x 10(3)/microl), without clinical evidence of fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Although posttraumatic arrhythmias are often observed, little is known regarding their frequency. This study utilized continuous ambulatory electrocardiography (i.e., Holter monitoring) to describe the cardiac rhythm disturbances in 30 dogs sustaining trauma in motor vehicle accidents. Ventricular ectopy was identified by Holter monitoring in 29 of 30 dogs, although the initial electrocardiogram (EKG) only documented ventricular ectopic complexes (VECs) in four dogs. Ventricular ectopy was infrequent in most dogs (i.e., 62% of the dogs had less than 100 VECs per day for the entire study), but 16% developed frequent arrhythmias (greater than 4,000 VECs per day). In all cases, the VECs were observed within 24 hours of injury. Forty-three percent of dogs had at least one episode of ventricular tachycardia, including several dogs that had an overall infrequent rate of VECs (i.e., less than 100 or 100 to 1,000 VECs per day). Although baseline EKGs are useful in identifying arrhythmias in most dogs, the length of the recording should be increased to improve the likelihood of observing an abnormal EKG event. Most importantly, additional EKGs should be obtained or continuous EKG monitoring should be performed in dogs that display clinical signs that could be attributed to ventricular arrhythmias.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Accidents, Traffic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injury Severity Score</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ventricular Premature Complexes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wounds and Injuries</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thrombocytopenia is an uncommon but well-documented extraintestinal hematological abnormality in humans; however, there are no previous reports of IBD and concurrent thrombocytopenia in the veterinary literature. Seven dogs having idiopathic IBD and concurrent thrombocytopenia were identified and evaluated retrospectively (this represents an incidence of 2.5% in the authors' IBD population). Obvious known causes for thrombocytopenia were eliminated by diagnostic testing as deemed appropriate by the clinician of record. Thrombocytopenia resolved with treatment for the IBD in some but not all patients. This is similar to reports in humans. Thrombocytopenia typically appears to be subclinical, and the severity does not correlate with the degree of intestinal inflammation defined histopathologically. However, quantitative platelet counts should be monitored during IBD therapy, as additional immunosuppression may be required to treat thrombocytopenia, despite resolution of gastrointestinal signs. It is speculated that thrombocytopenia may be causally associated with canine IBD, possibly secondary to immune stimulation from lumenal bacterial antigens, altered immunological regulation, or both.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytopenia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The overall mortality rate was 46%, with most cases of peritonitis being caused by leakage of the gastrointestinal tract (75%). Etiology of peritonitis, abdominal cytopathology, total white blood cell count, packed cell volume, total protein, and results of serum biochemistries were not statistically different between survivors and nonsurvivors. The mortality rate of 46% is similar to other studies in which the abdomen was left open postoperatively for the management of septic peritonitis, although more advanced medical treatment than that used in earlier studies may have positively affected the outcome. The results of this study show that closure of the abdomen after the source of contamination has been successfully corrected, in combination with thorough intraoperative peritoneal lavage and appropriate postoperative medical management, may be an acceptable alternative method for the management of septic peritonitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdomen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteremia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Florida</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgery, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The technique has been successfully applied in 12 feline patients. The placement technique is relatively simple, takes approximately five minutes to perform, and requires a scalpel blade, a curved hemostat, and an applicator for the insertion of the feeding tube. In contrast to other esophageal tube placement techniques, the tube is inserted into the definitive aboral position in a one-step procedure. Because of its shoehorn shape, the applicator allows the tube to be inserted into the esophagus safely and precisely. Placement of the tube in the midcervical area does not interfere with the function of the pharynx and avoids having the animal irritated by the presence of the tube. The chosen diameter of the tube is large enough to permit feeding of diluted, blended, commercial canned food. For the patients of this study, feeding was started after recovery from anesthesia, and tubes were removed without complications once the animals had started to eat voluntarily.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enteral Nutrition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophagostomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Placement of the duodenostomy tube (d-tube) is performed through a limited right flank approach under sedation and local anesthesia. Seven client-owned animals (three dogs and four cats) requiring enteral nutritional support were selected for d-tube placement. Patients were fed via the d-tube for two to 28 days. Complications included discomfort when manipulating and exteriorizing the duodenum, discomfort with bolus feedings, local cellulitis, and tube site infection. All complications resolved without further incident. This technique should be considered in patients that are not good candidates for prolonged general anesthesia or esophageal or gastric feeding, or patients being mechanically ventilated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Duodenostomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enteral Nutrition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs with a prolonged one-stage prothrombin time (OSPT) (P=0.031) and cats with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (P=0.024) were more likely to have complications than patients with normal values. Adequate tissue for histopathological diagnosis was obtained in 96.3% of cases. The likelihood of complication was smaller when the liver was biopsied than when the kidney was biopsied (n=259; P=0.0327).

The medical records, radiographs made immediately after surgery, and follow-up radiographs documenting a healed osteotomy were reviewed for 52 dogs treated with unilateral TPO and 38 dogs treated with bilateral TPO. Signalment, surgeon expertise, length of surgery, sequence of surgery in dogs treated bilaterally, use of ischial or ilial wires or both, screw depth in the sacrum, and screw migration were documented for each of the 128 pelvic osteotomies. Screws placed in the first and second plate hole, securing the cranial portion of the plate, loosened most frequently. Factors associated with decreased screw migration included use of an ischial hemicerclage wire and increased depth of sacral purchase with the first and second cranial screws.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Screws</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign-Body Migration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hip Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ostomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A follow-up study at 3 to 4 years of age included 12 dogs. High incidence rates of intervertebral disk calcification were seen at 6 to 18 months of age. The number of dogs affected and number of calcified disks seemed to reach a steady level or a maximum at about 24 to 27 months of age. Dissolution of previously calcified disks without clinical signs was demonstrated, causing decreasing numbers of visibly calcified disks after 2 years of age. Radiographic examination for calcified intervertebral disks in the dachshund is recommended at 24 to 30 months of age for heritability studies and selective breeding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcinosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Denmark</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Longitudinal Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At the time of surgery and following removal, the major portion of one ovary was loosely sutured to the mesentery and replaced in the abdominal cavity. Six months later, an abdominal laparotomy was performed in order to retrieve the ovarian remnants. Histopathological examination of the remnants showed viable tissue and evidence of ovarian follicles or corpora lutea in eight of nine (88.9%) cats. The ninth ovarian remnant was atrophied and fibrotic. Measurement of serum estradiol and progesterone, vaginal cytology, and stimulation of estrus and ovulation with a protocol using pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were unreliable indicators of ovarian activity in this study.

Twelve dogs presenting for aggressive behaviors were treated sequentially with amitriptyline (2 mg/kg body weight, per os [PO] bid) and a placebo for 4 weeks in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Standardized protocols for behavior modification were implemented throughout the trial. Owners maintained behavioral records and reported on the number of aggressive incidents as well as the dog's overall improvement at the end of each 4-week period. In the second phase, 27 cases of dogs presenting for aggressive behaviors and treated with amitriptyline were reviewed, and clients were contacted to record each dog's response to treatment. Reports were compared to those for dogs receiving behavior modification alone (i.e., placebo phase of prospective study).

The miniature schnauzer is reportedly the most frequently affected small breed, although clinical data from only six miniature schnauzers with FCEM is available in the literature. The purposes of this study were to determine the relative frequency of FCEM compared to other causes of myelopathy in miniature schnauzers, to characterize the clinicopathological features of FCEM in 38 miniature schnauzers, and to directly compare FCEM and intervertebral disk herniation in miniature schnauzers with respect to age at diagnosis; gender; neuroanatomical localization; and progression, asymmetry, and severity of neurological deficits. Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy was the most common cause of myelopathy in miniature schnauzers. Age at diagnosis, asymmetry and severity of neurological deficits, and lack of progression of clinical signs after 24 hours assisted in distinguishing FCEM from intervertebral disk herniation. Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy-related mortality in miniature schnauzers was significantly lower than mortality rates reported for affected large and giant breeds. Only 22% of miniature schnauzers were euthanized because of their disease, although the vast majority of survivors failed to achieve complete neurological recovery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embolism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indiana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Minnesota</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ohio</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The lag phase and the time to 25% (GET25), 50% (GET50), and 75% (GET75) gastric emptying of each sized marker were calculated. There was no significant difference between the lag phases of the small and large BIPS. There was a significant difference between the 1.5 and 5.0 markers at GET25, GET50, and GET75 in these medium-sized dogs. In a majority (70%) of the dogs in this study, GET25 of the 1.5-mm marker occurred at 4.73+/-1.44 hours; GET50 (1.5 mm) occurred at 8.29+/-1.62 hours, and GET75 (1.5 mm) occurred at 10.82+/-1.35 hours. The 5.0-mm markers tended to empty erratically and slowly. Four of the eight dogs retained some of the large markers in their stomachs at the end of the study period (24 hours).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Barium Sulfate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Contrast Media</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Emptying</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Particle Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyethylene</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Values</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ninety-five percent of animals presented within 12 hours of injury. The most common wound locations were neck, limbs, head, chest, shoulder region, and abdomen. Eighty-six percent had wounds to multiple locations. Fifty-seven percent of wounds were Class 4 (i.e., most severe). Based on results of all samples, 65% had positive aerobic cultures, 15% had positive anaerobic cultures, and 33% had negative cultures. The most commonly isolated aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus intermedius, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus coagulase negative, and Escherichia coli. Most common anaerobic isolates were Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., and Corynebacterium spp. Severe bite wounds had a high rate of bacterial contamination at presentation.

Clinical signs were typical of large-bowel diarrhea and included soft stool, hematochezia, tenesmus, and an increased frequency of defecation. Diagnosis in each case was made by light microscopic evaluation of endoscopically obtained colonic biopsy specimens. Treatment regimes varied, but included immunosuppressive agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, antimicrobials, and dietary modification. Clinical response was substantial in two patients, while the third patient was euthanized due to treatment failure.

To assist clinicians attempting to examine these patients, an echocardiographic algorithm containing the six most common canine congenital heart diseases (i.e., patent ductus arteriosus, subaortic stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, tricuspid dysplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot) is presented. The algorithm focuses on the underlying disease pathogenesis and the resultant changes in cardiac structure and function that can be readily identified during echocardiographic examination. Use of this algorithm provides a framework from which the ultrasonographer gains both experience and confidence in diagnosing congenital heart disease via echocardiography. This algorithm is supported by a number of still figures within the article as well as real-time echocardiographic images available for viewing at AAHA's website, www.aahanet.org.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Algorithms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aortic Stenosis, Subvalvular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Decision Trees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Defects, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Septal Defects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Valve Stenosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tetralogy of Fallot</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Of those radiographs where a site was identified, ability to accurately identify the correct site of disk extrusion ranged from 53% to 67%, with an average of 58%. Therefore, the overall accuracy rate for correct identification of the site(s) of disk extrusion for all survey radiographs was 35%. Twelve cases had more than one site of disk extrusion or protrusion evident myelographically.

Chronic renal failure was diagnosed on the basis of physical examination findings and results of a serum biochemical profile and urinalysis. Endoscopically obtained gastric biopsies were suggestive of a carcinoid tumor. Subsequently, an exploratory celiotomy with partial gastrectomy was performed. Histopathological and electron microscopic analysis of surgical biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of a gastric carcinoid, which has not been previously reported in the cat. Following complete excision, the cat remained clinically stable and free of signs of gastrointestinal disease for 4 months before requiring treatment for progressive renal failure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoid Tumor</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Renal Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vomiting</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Exploratory thoracotomy revealed severe, constrictive pleuritis as a sequela to chylothorax. Because of the poor prognosis for recovery from chylothorax in cats with thoracic duct ligation alone, and the lack of success in performing thoracic duct ligation in this cat, the omentum was advanced into the thorax through a hole created in the diaphragm and sutured within the thoracic cavity. The cat recovered from surgery and is clinically normal 13 months postoperatively.

Case records were evaluated, and clients were interviewed by telephone. The most common clinical signs of a juvenile or recessed vulva at initial examination were perivulvar dermatitis in 59% (20/34) of dogs and urinary incontinence and chronic urinary tract infection (UTI), each present in 56% (19/34) of dogs. Other common complaints included pollakiuria, irritation, and vaginitis. Most dogs developed clinical signs before 1 year of age. All dogs except one bichon frise were medium to giant breeds, suggesting that vulvar conformation may be related to growth rate or body conformation; prior ovariohysterectomy did not appear to be an influencing factor. Eighty-two percent of owners rated the outcome of the surgery as at least satisfactory. The incidence of urinary incontinence was reduced by vulvoplasty; however, it remained the most common residual sign after surgery, suggesting a multifactorial etiology. The incidences of UTI, vaginitis, and external irritation were greatly reduced after surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgery, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vulva</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Information was obtained from 109 private and institutional practices in the United States and Canada. Puppy vigor was determined by assessing three spontaneous conditions within 2 minutes after delivery: breathing, moving, and vocalizing. The percentages of live-born puppies with these characteristics were 85%, 73%, and 60%, respectively. After screening tests, logistic-regression models were run on all remaining factors using the litter as the unit of analysis, and odds ratios [OR] were determined. An OR &lt;1.0 means that the odds are decreased for that puppy vigor condition when the factor is present, compared with a litter in which the factor is not present. Conversely, when the OR is &gt;1.0, the odds are increased for that puppy vigor condition when that factor is present. The following factors were associated with the litter having all puppies breathing at birth: using an inhalant anesthetic (0.36 OR) or ketamine (0.43 OR), surgery at one particular private practice (3.52 OR), and surgery at a teaching institute rather than a private practice (0.36 OR). The following factors were associated with the litter having any spontaneously moving puppies at birth: all puppies breathing spontaneously (2.72 OR), any puppy vocalizing spontaneously (117 OR), using inhalant anesthesia (0.26 OR), and using thiopental or thiamylal (0.37 OR). The following factors were associated with the litter having any spontaneously vocalizing puppies at birth: all puppies breathing spontaneously (2.58 OR), any puppy moving spontaneously (152 OR), brachycephalic dam (0.62 OR), the dam was a Labrador retriever (7.23 OR), and using isoflurane (2.51 OR). In conclusion, the anesthetic factors associated with increased puppy vigor included the use of isoflurane and the avoidance of ketamine, thiamylal, and thiopental.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia, Obstetrical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Canada</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fetal Death</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perioperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records from 1986 to 1999 were reviewed for signalment, weight, diagnosis, tumor location, clinical signs, radiographic imaging procedures, surgical procedures, chemotherapy, duration of follow-up monitoring, outcome, cause of death, metastatic rate, metastatic sites, and method of detection of metastasis. Fourteen of 19 (74%) dogs with gastric adenocarcinomas had metastasis. Metastatic sites included gastric lymph nodes, omentum, liver, duodenum, pancreas, spleen, esophagus, adrenal glands, and lungs. Both cases of a gastric leiomyosarcoma had metastatic disease involving the liver (n=2) and duodenum (n=1). Surgery, consisting of either a Billroth I or a gastrojejunostomy, provided immediate relief of the gastric outflow obstruction and clinical improvement in the early postoperative period. The beneficial effects of chemotherapy alone or adjuvant chemotherapy are still unknown. Recurrence of clinical signs 3 days to 10 months after surgery caused all owners to elect euthanasia. The long-term prognosis for most cases of gastric adenocarcinomas and leiomyosarcomas is poor because of the presence of advanced disease.

Survival was 63% in dogs and 14% in cats. Rottweilers &lt;5 years of age were overrepresented. Clinical evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was common in dogs but not in cats. Shock was an uncommon presenting condition in dogs and was not closely linked to outcome. In fact, progression of an ulcerating lesion to GDP was not associated with marked changes in symptoms exhibited by many patients in this study. Most GDPs were associated with histopathological evidence of subacute or chronic peritoneal reaction at the time of diagnosis. This suggests that diagnostic methods employed lacked sensitivity in identifying early perforating lesions, and that dramatic signs of acute abdomen following gastroduodenal perforation may not be as common as was previously thought.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ohio</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peptic Ulcer Perforation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to compare the cross-sectional area of the left-ventricular outflow tract to the cross-sectional area of the aortic root. The ratio of these two areas demonstrated a strong inverse relationship (P=0.001; r2=0.778) with disease severity.

One or more parasite species were detected in 40 samples. Results showed that centrifugation with ZnSO4 solution was significantly more likely to detect a positive sample than benchtop procedures. The difference in procedures was due primarily to increased detection of Trichuris eggs and Giardia cysts by centrifugal flotation. No significant difference was seen in the ability of benchtop procedures to detect positive samples when tests sat either for 5 or 10 minutes before examination.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Ancylostoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Centrifugation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Giardia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Giardiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasite Egg Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Toxocara</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trichuris</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Zinc Sulfate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors of this report evaluated the suitability of this method for use by pet owners and the potential technical problems. The owners of seven healthy dogs and seven healthy cats were asked to perform two glucose curves (measuring blood glucose concentration every 2 hours for a total of 12 hours). All dog owners and three cat owners were able to perform a reliable blood glucose curve. The most frequently encountered problems were inadequate formation of a blood drop due to excessive digital pressure on the pinna, repeatedly depressing the plunger of the lancet device instead of allowing the negative pressure to slowly build up, and failure to fill the test strip up to the mark. The authors conclude that these steps of the procedure need to be stressed during technique demonstration and that home monitoring of blood glucose concentrations may serve as a new tool in the management of diabetic dogs and cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear, External</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equipment Design</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On presentation, the dog was laterally recumbent and hypovolemic. The dog had brown mucous membranes, severe Heinz-body hemolytic anemia, bleeding tendencies, and a red blood cell (RBC) glutathione (GSH) concentration that was 10% of reference values, despite a regenerative erythroid response. Treatment with s-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) as a GSH donor successfully rescued this dog, despite the animal's late presentation after drug ingestion. A loading dose (40 mg/kg body weight) of a stable SAMe salt per os was followed by a maintenance dose (20 mg/kg body weight) sid for 7 days. Additional therapeutic interventions included an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of one unit of packed RBCs (on admission), i.v. fluid support (3 days), and famotidine (7 days) to reduce gastric acidity. Sequential assessment of RBC GSH concentrations and RBC morphology documented response to antidote administration within 72 hours. This case suggests that SAMe may provide a therapeutic option for treatment of acetaminophen toxicosis in dogs capable of retaining an orally administered antidote and maintaining adequate hepatic function for metabolism of SAMe to its thiol substrates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acetaminophen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Transfusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergency Treatment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluid Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poisoning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>S-Adenosylmethionine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In these cats, radiographic patterns were characterized as bronchial (n=6), interstitial (n=3), and alveolar (n=2); other features included hyperinflation (n=3), bronchiectasis (n=2), pleural fissure lines (n=2), pulmonary nodules (n=2), atelectasis (n=1), and a tracheal mass (n=1). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was unremarkable in two cats. Abnormal BAL fluid showed inflammation (n=5), hemorrhage (n=2), epithelial hyperplasia (n=1), or was suspicious for neoplasia (n=1). Histopathological evaluation revealed inflammation (n=8), neoplasia (n=2), and vascular congestion (n=1). The predominant radiographic location of disease correlated with the same histopathological location in seven cats, and the cytopathological class of BAL fluid was consistent with the histopathological class of disease in seven cats. There was poor correlation between the types of cells found in the BAL fluid and the pathologist's prediction of the types of cells likely to be found in the BAL fluid based on the amount and type of airway cellularity seen on histopathological examination. The results of this study suggest that in some cats, BAL fluid cytopathology does not always correlate with the type of pulmonary disease identified on histopathology. In respiratory diseases where radiography and cytopathology fail to provide a definitive diagnosis, histopathological examination of the lung may be necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchoalveolar Lavage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Thoracic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Tract Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Six dogs were managed with a transarticular external skeletal fixator (ESF), and one dog was treated with plate fixation. The soft tissues were managed simultaneously along with the definitive joint stabilization in all cases. Minor complications occurred in four dogs: one dog that required a skin graft, one dog in which a skin graft was recommended but not performed, one dog in which a secondary skin closure was performed, and one dog in which a delayed cancellous bone graft was placed. Major complications occurred in three dogs: two dogs that required restabilization of the arthrodesis and one dog that required implant (i.e., plate) removal due to infection. All dogs healed with acceptable functional and cosmetic results. Further long-term evaluation of five dogs revealed that all but one dog had either excellent or good functional outcomes, and the remaining dog had a fair outcome. Similarly, five dogs had either excellent or good cosmetic outcomes, with the remaining dog having a fair outcome. All owners were very satisfied with the overall results.

Current described techniques for surgical treatment of urethral prolapse involve manual reduction of prolapsed mucosa and placement of a temporary purse-string suture at the penile tip, or resection of the prolapsed tissue and apposition of urethral and penile mucosa. The incidence of recurrence of urethral prolapse following resection of the prolapse is not known. This report describes a technique for surgical treatment of urethral prolapse in the male dog that minimizes surgical and anesthetic time, is simple to perform, requires minimal equipment, is effective, and is not associated with significant complications or recurrence. Three cases are described.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prolapse</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The laser is used to make an incision into the hematoma to allow for evacuation of the blood, and then multiple, small incisions are made over the surface of the hematoma to stimulate adhesions between the tissue layers. The CO2 laser was used in this fashion to treat 10 aural hematomas in eight dogs. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 23 months. Owners evaluated the cosmetic results following CO2 laser surgery as excellent in three ears, good in five ears, and fair in two ears. Hematomas were resolved in all 10 cases, although two cases developed serosanguineous fluid accumulation that required percutaneous drainage in one case and a second laser procedure in the other case.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carbon Dioxide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear, External</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laser Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The disease progressed to involve the right middle lung lobe. Cytopathology of a fine-needle aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were nondiagnostic. Surgical removal of the right caudal lung lobe and biopsy of the perihilar lymph nodes revealed pulmonary thromboembolism and reactive lymph nodes.

Both dogs had been diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism and were being treated with fludrocortisone acetate and prednisone when evaluated for muscle cramps. However, the muscle cramping started approximately 1 month prior to the diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism. Findings on general physical examination included lethargy and dehydration. Neurological examination was normal between episodes. Serum biochemical abnormalities included hyperalbuminemia, azotemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia.

Although three attempts of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy failed to provide definitive tumor diagnosis, results of angiography strongly indicated a soft-tissue sarcoma. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) using particles of gelatin sponge was performed following selective angiography. The mass was decreased in size on reevaluation 2 weeks after embolization. The dog was euthanized on the request of the owners due to overall failing health. Necropsy and pathological study confirmed the diagnosis of soft-tissue fibrosarcoma with pulmonary metastases. In a review of the literature, angiographic findings of soft-tissue sarcoma in the dog of this report were similar to those in human beings, suggesting a potential role for angiography in the differential diagnosis of suspect soft-tissue fibrosarcomas and for guiding FNA or surgical biopsy. Previous reports have also shown therapeutic embolization to be an effective treatment both in experimental animal study and in clinical practice in the human; therefore, TAE could be an effective adjunctive treatment of soft-tissue fibrosarcoma in the dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embolization, Therapeutic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fibrosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Angiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscle Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Developmental orthopedic diseases investigated included canine hip dysplasia (CHD); craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); fragmented coronoid process; hypertrophic osteodystrophy; Legg-Calv&#233;-Perthes disease; osteochondrosis of the medial humeral condyle, caudal humeral head, femoral condyles, and talar trochlear ridges; panosteitis; patella luxation; and ununited anconeal process. Dogs that were diagnosed with any one of the diseases of interest at any of 10 veterinary teaching hospitals participating in the Veterinary Medical Database from 1986 to 1995 were included as cases. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine risk. Frequency of diagnosis during the 10-year period ranged from 35 cases (CMO) to 10,637 cases (CHD). The number of breeds at increased risk for a disease ranged from one (CMO) to 35 (CHD). Breed susceptibility for a DOD may suggest a genetic component in the disease etiology. The results of this study serve to increase veterinarians' awareness of breeds susceptible to DODs and may facilitate the control of such diseases by identifying breeds that might benefit from breeding programs or environmental intervention such as dietary modification.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Diseases, Developmental</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hip Dysplasia, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indiana</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Odds Ratio</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Seven healthy, adult dogs from terminal teaching laboratories were maintained under anesthesia with isoflurane delivered with a mechanical ventilator. The experimental variables were recorded before introduction of an intrathoracic catheter, at intrathoracic pressures (IP) of 0 mm Hg, 3 mm Hg insufflation, and additional increments of 1 mm Hg insufflation thereafter until the SPO2 remained &lt;85% despite increases in minute volume. Finally the variables were measured again at 0 mm Hg IP. The cardiac output and systolic and diastolic AP significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased at 3 mm Hg IP. Significant decreases in SPO2 were seen at 10 mm Hg IP. Significant increase in CVP was noted at 6 mm Hg IP. Heart rate decreased significantly at 5 to 6 mm Hg IP but was not decreased above 6 mm Hg IP. Given the degree of CO decrease at low intrathoracic pressures, insufflation-aided thoracoscopy should be used with caution and at the lowest possible insufflation pressure.

A contrast fistulogram demonstrated a cutaneopulmonary fistula. Excision of the fistulous tract retrieved a migrating foreign body (i.e., a toothpick) within the tract. Clinical signs resolved 2 weeks following surgery. Foreign body migration is a common problem seen in dogs, resulting in many different clinical syndromes. Definitive surgery depends upon complete removal of the foreign body and the diseased tissue. Sinography is an inexpensive, readily available diagnostic tool that can help define a draining tract and confirm a foreign body.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign-Body Migration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Tract Fistula</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Four normal dogs were also similarly imaged. Compression of the soft-tissue structures within the vertebral canal at the lumbosacral space was assessed in two ways: by measuring dorsoventral diameter on T1-weighted sagittal images and cross-sectional area on transverse images. The severity of the clinical signs was compared to the severity of cauda equina compression. No significant correlation was found. It is concluded that degree of compression as determined by MRI at time of presentation is independent of disease severity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cauda Equina</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Low Back Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nerve Compression Syndromes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pennsylvania</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Severity of Illness Index</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Stenosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

As such, it is bound by the same tenets that govern the recommendation of other medical procedures-principally, that it be tailored to the needs of the individual patient. Many diseases we immunize against are ubiquitous. Many are serious and some even life threatening. Some are of limited demographic concern given the exposure risk for each patient. These factors have all been considered in developing the AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines. In the end, each veterinarian must do what he or she determines to be in the best interest of the patient. Vaccination of individual animals produces not only individual immunity but also population or herd immunity. Since we have no readily available and reliable way to determine if each patient has developed an adequate immune response, we encourage the practice philosophy of vaccinating more patients while vaccinating each patient no more than needed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Societies, Medical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eight dogs were diagnosed with prostatic abscesses and five with cysts on the basis of cytopathological examination and bacterial culture of the prostatic fluid. Antibiotic therapy, based on culture and sensitivity results, was administered for a minimum of 4 weeks. Intact dogs were castrated after initial drainage. Repeat ultrasonography of the prostate was performed every 1 to 6 weeks, and any residual cavitary lesions were drained and fluid analysis repeated. The median number of drainage procedures required to completely resolve the lesions was two (range, one to four). No complications were observed after drainage, and clinical signs resolved in all dogs. None of the dogs developed clinical signs of recurrent abscesses or cysts in the follow-up period (median, 36 months; range, 10 to 50 months). Ultrasound-guided, percutaneous drainage of prostatic abscesses and cysts appears to be a useful alternative to surgical treatment in select dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cysts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Interventional</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This paper describes the clinical signs and diagnostic findings, including radiographic, endoscopic, and histopathological abnormalities, in three young, purebred, male cats with esophagitis presumed to be secondary to GER. Clinical signs included regurgitation, dysphagia, and weight loss. Contrast radiography revealed GER, esophageal dilatation, and decreased motility. Endoscopy showed hyperemia, increased vascularity, ulcers, erosion, and an abnormal lower esophageal sphincter. Histopathological lesions included squamous hyperplasia and dysplasia, erosions, ulcers, and an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils.

Sensitivities of screening tests and abdominal ultrasonographic evaluation for the detection of portosystemic shunting were evaluated. Prognosis for surgically treated shunts was also evaluated. Results indicated that both paired serum bile acids and blood ammonia levels were useful screening tests for portosystemic shunting. However, paired bile acid tests were significantly more sensitive than blood ammonia levels. Overall postoperative mortality rates for extrahepatic shunts and intrahepatic shunts were 8.7% and 20%, respectively. Postoperative mortality rates were slightly higher for animals treated with partial ligation when compared to those treated with ameroid ring placement, although this did not reach statistical significance. Long-term complication rates for animals with single extrahepatic portosystemic shunts treated with complete ligation, ameroid ring placement, and partial ligation alone were 9%, 15.4%, and 42%, respectively. Animals &gt;2 years of age with extrahepatic shunts had almost identical postoperative mortality and long-term complication rates as animals &lt; or = 2 years of age. No animal in this study had paired bile acid samples within the reference range postoperatively, indicating continued abnormal liver function after surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Alabama</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertension, Portal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portal System</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The "clam shell" configuration resulted in less pressure being applied to all palmar pad surfaces. For the major weight-bearing pad, a basic paw bandage with an intermediate compressible foam sponge that had a hole under the major weight-bearing pad, combined with a metal splint paw cup under the sponge, resulted in a significantly lower pressure recording than for other bandage configurations. Digital pads 3 and 5 had the greatest pressure in a basic bandage configuration. Based on pressures on these pads, a basic paw bandage with an intermediate compressible foam sponge under the major weight-bearing pad, with or without a metal splint paw cup under the sponge, helped elevate the digits to relieve pressure on them. Placing a foam sponge pad, with or without a splint paw cup under the palmar paw surface, also provided less pressure on these pads.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bandages</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gait</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weight-Bearing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Significantly more defects occurred in gloves used for nonsoft-tissue procedures and in gloves worn on the nondominant hand. Eighty-four percent of all defects occurred in procedures lasting &gt;60 minutes. No differences were detected in the brands of gloves used nor among surgeons of different experience levels. The individuals performing the surgery were not able to accurately predict the presence of a defect in their gloves.

Proteinuria, glucosuria, and decreased concentration of urine have been considered normal in puppies &lt;8 weeks of age due to immature renal function. In this study, the authors reviewed 149 voided urine samples from 118 different, apparently healthy, random-source puppies. The primary finding was that mean urine specific gravity (USG) was significantly lower in 0- to 3-week-old puppies when compared to puppies 4 to 24 weeks old. Mean USG in all other age groups was &gt;1.030. There was no difference in the frequency of positive protein or occult blood dipstick results among age groups, and there were no positive glucose, ketone, bilirubin, or urobilinogen reactions in any samples analyzed. Urine sediment results are reported for 41 samples. Epithelial cells and white blood cells were the most common sediment findings in these 41 voided samples, observed in 34 (83%) and 18 (44%) samples, respectively. Crystals were observed in 15 (37%) samples, whereas casts, bacteria, and red blood cells were observed less commonly.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Occult Blood</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteinuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Values</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Specific Gravity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinalysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiographic evidence of blebs or bullae was seen in only one dog. None of the dogs responded to conservative treatment with thoracocentesis or thoracostomy tube drainage. A median sternotomy approach was used to explore the thorax in all dogs. Pulmonary blebs and bullae were resected with partial or complete lung lobectomy. Ten of the dogs had more than one lesion, and seven of the dogs had bilateral lesions. The cranial lung lobes were most commonly affected. Histopathology results of the blebs and bullae were consistent in all dogs and resembled lesions found in humans with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. None of the dogs developed recurrence of pneumothorax. Median follow-up time was 19 months.

Heartworms were identified in 4.9% of cats, and serological evidence of heartworm exposure was present in 17% of cats. Not all cats from which heartworms were recovered were seropositive for heartworm antigen or antibody. There was no association between heartworm infection and co-infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

Both cats resided in the same household and were fed a home-prepared, raw meat-based diet. Salmonella was isolated from multiple organs in both cats and from samples of raw beef incorporated into the diet fed to one of the cats. Subtyping of the bacterial isolates yielded Salmonella newport from one cat and from the diet it had been fed. This report provides evidence that the practice of feeding raw meat-based diets to domestic cats may result in clinical salmonellosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Contamination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Microbiology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salmonella Food Poisoning</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Each dog's reaction to the doll and the hand was categorized as normal, fearful, fearfully aggressive, or offensively aggressive. Sixty-five percent (n=37) of the dogs that had a normal or no reaction to the stimuli had a history of being good with children. Eighty-eight percent (n=34) of the dogs that had an aggressive reaction to the doll had a history of aggressive behavior toward a child. Dogs that were fearfully aggressive were significantly more likely to show fearful responses to the doll, and dogs that were either dominant or fearfully aggressive were more likely to exhibit aggression of the same type to the hand. The results of this study indicate that the doll and, to a lesser extent, the hand may be useful components in determining the aggressive tendencies of dogs.

The most common clinical signs were dyspnea and vomiting; however, many of the animals were presented for nonspecific signs such as anorexia, lethargy, and weight loss. Thoracic radiographs revealed evidence of diaphragmatic hernia in only 66% of the animals, and additional imaging tests were often needed to confirm the diagnosis. Thirty-six hernias were repaired through a midline laparotomy; 14 required a median sternotomy combined with a laparotomy. In 14 animals, division of mature adhesions of the lungs or diaphragm to the herniated organs was necessary to permit reduction of the hernia. Fourteen animals required resection of portions of the lungs, liver, or intestine. All hernias were sutured primarily without the use of tissue flaps or mesh implants. Twenty-one of the animals developed transient complications in the postoperative period; the most common of these was pneumothorax. The mortality rate was 14%. Thirty-four (79%) of the animals that were discharged from the hospital had complete resolution of clinical signs, and none developed evidence of recurrent diaphragmatic hernia during the follow-up period.

Laboratory methods of evaluation of body composition in live dogs have included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and deuterium oxide (D(2)O) dilution. Clinical methods of evaluation include assigning a body condition score (BCS) based on visual observation, palpation, and morphometric measurements. This study used these four methods to evaluate 23 healthy, adult, client-owned dogs. Good correlation (coefficient of determination [r(2)]=0.78) was found between measurements of percent body fat (%BF) determined by the D(2)O dilution method and the DEXA scan. Percent body fat can also be estimated using BCS (r(2)=0.92 comparison with DEXA) or by using morphometric measurements with simple calculations (r(2)=0.92 comparison with DEXA).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Absorptiometry, Photon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adipose Tissue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Composition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Water</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deuterium Oxide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Obesity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radioisotope Dilution Technique</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At varying times after day 100 from the onset of the second proestrus, cabergoline (5 microg/kg per os q 24 hours) was administered from early (n=11), mid- (n=10), and late (n=2) anestrus until 2 days after the beginning of the following proestrus. Interestrous intervals (IEI) were significantly shorter in the cabergoline-treated time periods when compared to the nontreated IEI (184+/-4.5 days versus 239+/-4.5 days; P&lt;0.01). The mean number of days of cabergoline treatment until the onset of proestrus was 21.4+/-2.9 (least square means and standard error of the mean [LSM+/-SEM]). Mean cabergoline treatment durations beginning in early, mid-, and late anestrus were 27.4+/-3.7, 17.6+/-3.8, and 5+/-3 days (LSM+/-SEM), respectively.

To avoid misdiagnosis, the ultrasonographer should ensure multi-plane scanning of the lesion, paying particular attention to the completeness of the lesion's peripheral ring structure and the overall width of the concentric rings of the target-like lesion. The presence of a semilunar or G-shaped hyperechoic center and the visualization of the inner intussusceptum (extending into the intussusception lumen) can be useful ultrasonographic findings that distinguish an intussusception from other lesions or from healthy tissues.

Two dietary treatments were evaluated in each cat: the diet consumed just prior to urolith detection and a canned diet formulated to prevent CaOx uroliths. This study revealed that hypercalciuria is a consistent abnormality in cats with CaOx urolith formation. When urolith-forming cats consumed a diet formulated to prevent urolith formation, activity product ratios for CaOx (which estimate the degree to which urine is saturated with CaOx) were significantly lower.

Permanent alapexy was achieved in four of five dogs (eight of nine nostrils) that were operated. Four animals had significant improvement in their respiratory efforts because of reduced nasal obstruction. Although the alapexy procedure was somewhat more difficult to perform than simple wedge resection techniques, it may be a viable option in those animals where other techniques have failed or in animals that have dystrophic or flaccid alar cartilage. The alapexy technique may also improve the diameter of the nares compared to previously described techniques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhinoplasty</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The technique was performed using two different fixation methods (i.e., cannulated interference screw, cannulated screw and tissue washer). All six dogs had successful outcomes in terms of return to full function at a mean follow-up time of 11.7 months after surgery. Arthroscopic biceps tenodesis is a feasible option for surgical management of biceps tendon pathology, and it may have advantages over open tenodesis and open or arthroscopic tenotomy. Further study is needed before definitive recommendations regarding indications, complications, and prognosis associated with arthroscopic biceps tenodesis can be made.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthroscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Screws</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendinopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendon Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The difficulty in diagnosing PTE in small animals is confounded by its subtle symptomatic presentation and a lack of clinical suspicion, coexisting disease states, and lack of noninvasive tests that are sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PTE. Although numerous laboratory markers of coagulation have been studied, only the D-dimer assay has shown clinical utility in detecting early embolism in humans.

In household pets, MRSA infections are uncommon but are on the rise, possibly because of the increased prevalence of human MRSA in the community. Clinical MRSA infections in some animals can be life threatening and difficult to treat; however, other animals may develop mild disease or only become colonized.

These epithelial defects may be present for weeks to months, particularly if left untreated or if treated inappropriately. Typical histopathological findings include loss of the corneal epithelial basement membrane and formation of a superficial, acellular, hyalinized zone in the stroma. Together, these histological abnormalities lead to delayed wound healing and poor epithelial adhesion. Epithelial debridement, anterior stromal puncture, grid keratotomy, and superficial keratectomy are the most common treatment options applied to the defects. Procedures that address the stromal changes present generally have a higher success rate than epithelial debridement alone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corneal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Debridement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Keratotomy, Radial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An apical systolic heart murmur was the most common physical abnormality. According to fractional shortening and end-systolic diameter on echocardiography, significant improvements (P&lt;0.005) were recorded within 3 to 6 months of starting taurine supplementation. The dogs regained substantial systolic function, and four were weaned off all cardiac medications except taurine.

Feline acromegaly is most commonly caused by a functional pituitary tumor. Definitive diagnosis can be difficult because of the gradual disease onset, subtle clinical signs, unavailability of relevant laboratory tests, and client financial investment. The most significant clinical finding of acromegaly is the presence of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis is currently based upon brain imaging and measurement of serum GH and/or insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations. Definitive treatment in cats is not well described, but radiation therapy appears promising.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acromegaly</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Growth Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin Resistance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The current method of caring for a person with multiple issues and problems is a "multidisciplinary" approach; however, the disadvantages of a multidisciplinary approach are many. A more desirable alternative is an "interdisciplinary" approach. Interdisciplinary care is predicated on professionals communicating with one another about a single patient and designing care that is in the overall best interest of the patient.

Veterinarians tend to under-diagnose and under-treat pain in this aloof and stoic species. Until recently, there was only one analgesic (i.e., butorphanol) approved in the United States for use in cats; but many analgesics, particularly opioids, have been used extra-label for this purpose. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used sparingly in cats because of safety concerns, which are less of an issue with the newer agents. Meloxicam is the only NSAID labeled for use in cats in the United States, but other agents are available in this country and are labeled for use in cats in other countries.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Analgesics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meloxicam</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Safety</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thiazines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thiazoles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neither an increasing number of animal-protein ingredients (P=0.79) nor an increasing number of soy and cereal ingredients (P=0.83) among the first four ingredients significantly influenced GDV risk. An unexpected finding was that dry foods containing an oil or fat ingredient (e.g., sunflower oil, animal fat) among the first four ingredients were associated with a significant (P=0.01), 2.4-fold increased risk of GDV. These findings suggest that the feeding of dry dog foods that list oils or fats among the first four label ingredients predispose a high-risk dog to GDV.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Carbohydrates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Fats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multivariate Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Volvulus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At surgery, eight cats had evidence of inadequate dissection to the bulbourethral glands, and three cats had evidence of urine extravasation into the subcutaneous tissues. Following revision of the stoma, long-term follow-up was obtained in nine cases. For eight cats, owners reported no complications after the revision. Failure to dissect beyond the bulbourethral glands and inadequate mucosa-to-skin apposition resulted in postoperative stricture formation. Stoma revisions were performed a median of 71 days following the initial perineal urethrostomy, indicating that long-term evaluation of cases is necessary.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reoperation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Diversion</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sensitivities to enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and orbifloxacin were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration testing (MICT). Isolates were also tested for sensitivities to enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin using disk-diffusion susceptibility testing (DDST). Isolates were significantly more sensitive to marbofloxacin than to enrofloxacin (z = -4.57; P&lt;0.05) or orbifloxacin (z = -5.02; P&lt;0.05). Agreement was 87% between MICT and DDST for marbofloxacin, with approximately equal numbers of overestimation and underestimation errors. Agreement was 74% between MICT and DDST for enrofloxacin, but DDST tended to overestimate the number of enrofloxacin-susceptible strains. These results suggest that marbofloxacin is more effective against P. aeruginosa than either enrofloxacin or orbifloxacin and that relying on DDST may lead to ineffective enrofloxacin treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ciprofloxacin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colony Count, Microbial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enrofloxacin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluoroquinolones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pseudomonas Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quinolones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sixty dogs were randomly allocated into four groups: preoperative bupivacaine, postoperative bupivacaine, preoperative saline, and postoperative saline. All dogs were premedicated with acepromazine and meperidine; then they were anesthetized with thiopentone and isoflurane. Each group received either bupivacaine or normal saline before midline incision or just before skin closure. After surgery, pain scores were assigned using a numerical rating scale. Preoperative bupivacaine was associated with significantly lower pain scores and a significantly lower need for opioid administration.

This type of pseudothrombocytopenia is not a pathological process by itself, but it can be clinically significant if diagnostics and medical treatments are initiated based on the reported thrombocytopenia. Platelet clumping occurs with EDTA-dependent PTCP, resulting in inaccurate hematology analyzer platelet concentrations. A nontraumatic venipuncture may be sufficient to obtain an accurate platelet count. However, rare cases in the dog may require blood drawn into a different anticoagulant, such as sodium citrate, to help discriminate a true thrombocytopenia from PTCP.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anticoagulants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edetic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Platelet Aggregation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Platelet Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytopenia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A thymoma was diagnosed following ultrasound and biopsy of the mass. Treatment was initiated with coarse-fraction radiation therapy using external-beam therapy (four fractions of 5 Gy). The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes. Immune suppression with prednisone and cyclosporine was instituted. After 7 weeks, the neutrophil count returned to normal. The tumor was removed, and cyclosporine was reduced and eventually discontinued 3 weeks postsurgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Agranulocytosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutropenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiation Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Washington</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs and cats residing in and visiting endemic areas are at risk of exposure to infectious arthrospores. The primary infection is pulmonary and frequently results in chronic cough. Disseminated disease is common and causes cutaneous, osseous, cardiac, ocular, nervous system, or other organ disease. Radiographic changes include a variable degree of interstitial pulmonary infiltration, hilar lymphadenopathy, and osseous lesions. Serological titers support the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis relies on identification of Coccidioides in cytological or tissue samples. Coccidioidomycosis should be considered in any dog or cat that has been potentially exposed during the previous 3 years and is presented with chronic illness, respiratory signs, lameness, lymphadenopathy, nonhealing cutaneous lesions, or neurological, ocular, or cardiac abnormalities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coccidioides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coccidioidomycosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Thoracic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The two selection methods were 1) nasal septal width pairing with outer diameter of an endotracheal tube, and 2) digital palpation of the tracheal outer diameter to determine the endotracheal tube size. All dogs were dolichocephalic breeds. Results of this study showed that the canine nasal septal width method of endotracheal tube selection was correlated with the size of the tracheal internal (r=0.72) and outer (r=0.73) diameters. However, evidence shows that the digital palpation method is slightly more effective than the nasal width method in selecting the best-fitting endotracheal tube. The percentage of the best-fit tube selection for the nasal septal width method was 21%, while the digital palpation method was 46%. With these two methods, selecting an endotracheal tube that is too small is possible, especially when the tube internal diameter is &gt; or =7 mm.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intubation, Intratracheal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trachea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

When samples from healthy and diseased animals were considered together, a significantly greater percentage of neutrophils was seen on CP than on MSP slides (P&lt;0.002). Cytospin preparations were considered of better quality in all individual comparisons. Cytospin preparation is advised in the evaluation of BALF with low total cell count.

The protocol was well tolerated, with no increase in early or late effects over previously published protocols. Forty-three (91%) of 47 dogs responded positively to radiation, with a median time of 2 days to onset of pain relief. Median duration of pain relief was 67 days (range 12 to 503 days; mean 99+/-16 days). Median survival time for all dogs was 136 days (mean 179+/-18 days).

Records of 155 dogs with appendicular OSA treated with amputation and single-agent carboplatin were included from 14 centers. Any carboplatin dosage, number of doses, and protocol schedule were eligible for inclusion. The median disease-free interval (DFI) was 256 days. The median overall survival time was 307 days. Similar prognostic survival factors were identified in this study as reported in prior studies of canine appendicular OSA. Median DFI and survival were comparable to those reported in the original Bergman et al publication. Carboplatin treatment improves the survival probability in dogs with appendicular OSA compared to amputation alone and remains an acceptable alternative to adjuvant treatment with cisplatin.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amputation, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carboplatin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 9-year-old, castrated male cat underwent thoracotomy for a pulmonary mass. The removed mass was attached to the diaphragm that histologically was ectopic liver. The ectopic liver had no connection with the main liver. Because the occurrence of ectopic supradiaphragmatic hepatic tissue is a possibility, this should be considered as a differential diagnosis for caudal pulmonary or caudal mediastinal masses in a cat. This report describes, to the authors' knowledge, the first case of ectopic hepatic tissue attached to the diaphragm of a cat. The authors also characterize the asymptomatic clinical presentation and radiographic findings of this cat and suggest further imaging with computed tomography in unusual case presentations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Choristoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diaphragm</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 14-month-old Maine coon was diagnosed with an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the rectus abdominus muscle, which was treated with complete surgical excision. Although no clinical progression was noted after surgery, the cat succumbed to pulmonary metastasis within 7 months. The histological diagnosis was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (myotubular subtype). This category of striated muscle tumors is thought to have a more aggressive clinical course. The rapid demise of this cat even with no clinical or histological evidence of metastasis at the time of resection may indicate that, as in human medicine, adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered in conjunction with early surgical excision in preventing disease progression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination and radiographs revealed severe edema of the head and face that was cranial to a circumferential, midcervical constriction caused by scarring related to previous removal of a foreign body. Surgical en bloc resection of the cicatricial tissue was performed, and clinical signs resolved completely after 2 months. Histopathology showed ongoing inflammation and hairs within a fibrous band.

Each sample was sent to a toxicology laboratory for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) validation. On-site test results and GC/MS assays confirmed that the human on-site test kit did identify barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines, and amphetamines/methamphetamines in urine from dogs that had received these common illicit drugs/drug classes either intravenously and/or orally. However, neither the on-site test kit nor the GC/MS individual assays for marijuana or methadone, a synthetic opiate, were effective in identifying marijuana and methadone in urine from dogs with suspected or known exposure. No index of suspicion was seen for exposure to phencyclidines or cocaine during the study period, and no exposures were indicated by the on-site test results. Overall, the test is a rapid, readily available, affordable, and useful complement to the veterinarian's clinical consideration and professional judgment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amphetamines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Barbiturates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Benzodiazepines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>California</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cannabinoids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergencies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Illicit Drugs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoassay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methadone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Narcotics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reagent Kits, Diagnostic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Substance Abuse Detection</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision with adjuvant therapy based on histopathological diagnosis and completeness of removal. Location of the mass within the rectum helps dictate the approach used. This paper describes the use of a novel technique for removal of rectal masses involving the distal third of the rectum in seven dogs. To perform this technique, the rectum is prolapsed and stay sutures are placed to maintain prolapse. A thoracoabdominal stapling device is placed at the base of the mass with a minimum of 0.5- to 1-cm margins, and the mass is amputated. Mean time to veterinarian follow-up was 564 days, and no dog had recurrence of disease during this time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colorado</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rectal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Schools, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Staplers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Stapling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Results showed that clinical signs may be seen in some animals at doses lower than previously reported. Some dogs may have p-glycoprotein defects or other reasons for increased susceptibility to ivermectin toxicosis.

Review of medical records of 49 dogs with a radiographic diagnosis of MCP or MTP OA presented over a 7-year period demonstrated that OA was an "incidental finding" for the majority of animals (n=35), while 14 dogs were identified as clinically lame as a result of MCP or MTP OA. Dogs that were clinically lame as a result of MCP or MTP OA were significantly more likely to have visible swelling over the affected digits. Five times as many dogs were diagnosed with MCP OA than with MTP OA, and the majority of dogs had radiographic changes on multiple digits. Review and scoring of radiographs (n=44 dogs) for six radiographic signs of OA followed by logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the two lateral digits of the front limb were significantly more likely to have osteophytosis and enthesophytosis than the two medial digits. Osteoarthritis of MCP and MTP joints has unique radiographic features that are not seen in the stifle, hip, shoulder, or elbow; these features can complicate accurate diagnosis, particularly differentiation from primary bone neoplasia. These data underscore the clinical relevance of this condition and provide useful information detailing which and how many digits are most commonly affected, potentially assisting discrimination between OA and neoplasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colorado</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Universities</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Over a 19-month follow-up, the dog did not relapse and has remained a well-regulated diabetic.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Combinations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulins, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunologic Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoxazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leflunomide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>19570897</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Reevaluation of predictive factors for complete recovery in dogs with nonambulatory tetraparesis secondary to cervical disk herniation.</Title>	<Abstract>The vast majority of dogs with cervical disk herniation experience cervical pain and only mild motor deficits; therefore, not much is known about the factors that predict recovery in dogs with nonambulatory tetraparesis (NAT) secondary to cervical disk herniation. In this retrospective study, we tested the hypothesis that two previously reported prognostic factors, site of disk herniation and severity of neurological deficits, are useful predictors of complete recovery. Overall, 20 (62%) of 32 dogs with cervical disk herniation-associated NAT had complete recovery. Site of disk herniation was not a significant predictor of complete recovery; dogs with high cervical lesions (C2 to C3, C3 to C4) did not have a higher likelihood of complete recovery than other dogs. Likewise, severity of neurological deficits (i.e., intact voluntary motor function versus absent voluntary motor function) was not a significant predictor of complete recovery. Using stepwise logistic regression, two significant predictors of complete recovery were identified. Small dogs (delta15 kg body weight) were six times more likely to achieve complete recovery than larger dogs. Dogs that regained the ability to walk within 96 hours after surgery were seven times more likely to completely recover than dogs not walking 96 hours after surgery. We conclude that neither the site of disk herniation nor severity of neurological deficits assists the clinician in predicting postoperative outcome in dogs with cervical disk herniation-associated NAT. Reliable preoperative predictors of complete recovery are needed to advance current diagnostic and treatment protocols to improve overall prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cervical Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Decompression, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Early Ambulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herniorrhaphy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multivariate Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recovery of Function</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records of 47 dogs that had received local anesthesia for NM-to-superotemporal bulbar conjunctiva flap were reviewed. Combined local anesthetic technique included auriculopalpebral nerve block, topical anesthesia of the eye, and infiltration anesthesia of the superotemporal bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral surface of the NM. Forty-two (89.3%) dogs complied with the anesthetic procedures and underwent NM flap without general anesthesia or sedation. No complications were related to the combined local anesthesia.

Thirteen dogs diagnosed with SARDS on the basis of complete ophthalmic examination and extinguished bright-flash electroretinogram were evaluated for steroid hormonal abnormalities. Signalment, case history, physical examination, and clinicopathological findings were recorded. Serum cortisol and sex-hormone concentrations were measured before and after adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation. Clinical signs of HAC, systemic hypertension, and proteinuria were commonly found in dogs with SARDS. Elevations in one or more sex hormones were found in 11 (85%) of 13 dogs (95% confidence interval [CI] 65% to 100%); cortisol was elevated in nine (69%) of 13 dogs (95% CI 44% to 94%). A minority of dogs (three [23%] of 13; 95% CI 0.2% to 46%) exhibited only an increase in adrenal sex hormones. Only one dog had completely normal ACTH stimulation test results. Symptoms of HAC were associated with abnormal ACTH stimulation results.

These doses were clinically equipotent. Serum fructosamine and urine glucose were measured on days 0, 28, and 56. Insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and peak insulin secretion were measured in each group prior to and at the end of the courses of glucocorticoid administration. On day 56, the prevalence of glucosuria was significantly greater (P=0.027), and a trend was seen toward greater fructosamine concentrations (P=0.083) in dexamethasone-treated cats compared to prednisolone-treated cats. The results of this pilot study also showed a trend toward a greater decrease in insulin sensitivity (P=0.061) and a significantly lower compensatory increase in insulin secretion (P=0.081) in the dexamethasone-treated cats than in cats administered prednisolone. These preliminary data suggest that dexamethasone exhibits greater diabetogenic effects in cats than equipotent doses of prednisolone.

Relatively few cases have been described in pregnant women, and perinatal transmission appears to occur infrequently in humans. Infection in pregnant dogs has not been reported. Diagnosis of infection during pregnancy poses therapeutic challenges, because doxycycline, the treatment of choice, is teratogenic. Also, infection during pregnancy may result in more severe disease. When infection is diagnosed after parturition, knowledge of the risk of perinatal transmission to offspring is important, because prophylactic therapy in neonates is also not without risk.

Common causes include vehicular trauma, dog fights, and kicks by large animals. Rupture of the prepubic tendon in dogs and of its equivalent in cats results in a ventral abdominal hernia. Due to the traumatic nature of the injury, concurrent injuries are frequently seen. Clinical signs of herniation are often nonspecific, and the resultant hernia may not be readily apparent during routine physical examination. This being so, diagnosis is often based on a thorough physical examination in conjunction with abdominal radiography and, possibly, abdominal ultrasonography. Multiple methods of repair of prepubic hernia have been reported, and survival rates are quite good if concurrent injuries are not severe.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia, Inguinal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia, Ventral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pelvis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendon Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An end-to-side ureteral anastomosis was performed. The incomplete ureteral occlusion was determined to be related to an ovarian pedicle granuloma formation and was presumably related to a reaction to the suture material used for ovariohysterectomy (OVH) performed 5 years prior to presentation. Azotemia and hydronephrosis were dramatically improved after surgery, and renal function has been well maintained for 3 years. To the authors' knowledge, a chronic partial ureteral occlusion associated with an ovarian pedicle granuloma from an OVH has not been reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Granuloma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydronephrosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ureteral Obstruction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Canine oncology cases that were diagnosed with multiple, confirmed, distinct malignancies were prospectively collected for analysis. Approximately 3% of 1722 dogs that were presented to the oncology service at the Colorado State University Veterinary Medical Center were diagnosed with multiple distinct primary tumors. No significant breed or sex predisposition was apparent. Dogs with mast cell tumor, malignant melanoma, and thyroid carcinoma were significantly overrepresented and thus more likely to be diagnosed with multiple tumor types. These findings emphasize the importance of thorough, whole-body evaluation for dogs presented with mast cell tumor, malignant melanoma, and thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, because approximately 33% of dogs that were presented with thyroid tumors were found to have additional distinct tumors, complete staging is justified in all dogs presented with thyroid tumors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melanoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiple Myeloma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms, Multiple Primary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Factors were evaluated in this study for their influence on overall and postoperative mortality in 306 confirmed cases of GDV between 2000 and 2004. The overall mortality rate was 10%, and the postoperative mortality rate was 6.1%. The factor that was associated with a significant increase in overall mortality was the presence of preoperative cardiac arrhythmias. Factors that were associated with a significant increase in postoperative mortality were postoperative cardiac arrhythmias, splenectomy, or splenectomy with partial gastric resection. The factor that was associated with a significant decrease in the overall mortality rate was time from presentation to surgery. This study documents that certain factors continue to affect the overall and postoperative mortality rates associated with GDV, but these mortality rates have decreased compared to previously reported rates.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follow-Up Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Logistic Models</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Volvulus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze abdominal ultrasonographic findings associated with cats with confirmed FIPV infection. Sixteen cases were included in the study from a review of medical records at two academic institutions; inclusion was based either on necropsy lesions (n=13) or a combination of histopathological, cytological, and clinicopathological findings highly suggestive of FIPV infection (n=3). The liver was judged to be normal in echogenicity in 11 (69%) cats, diffusely hypoechoic in three cats, focally hyperechoic in one cat, and focally hypoechoic in one cat. Five cats had a hypoechoic subcapsular rim in one (n=3) or both (n=2) kidneys. Free fluid was present in the peritoneal cavity in seven cats and in the retroperitoneal space in one cat. Abdominal lymphadenopathy was noted in nine cats. The spleen was normal in echogenicity in 14 cats and was hypoechoic in two. One cat had bilateral orchitis with loss of normal testicular architecture. Although none of these ultrasonographic findings are specific for FIPV infection, a combination of these findings should increase the index of suspicion for FIPV infection when considered along with appropriate clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdomen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feline Infectious Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We hypothesize that LP may be part of a generalized polyneuropathy complex. Electro-diagnostic studies were performed in six dogs, and histopathological studies of muscle and nerve biopsies were obtained from 11 dogs diagnosed with acquired LP. Abnormalities in electrodiagnostic procedures were consistent with a generalized polyneuropathy.

Despite the frequency of use in humans, reports in veterinary medicine remain scarce. The medical records of three dogs and one cat were reviewed. Two animals that were presented with hematochezia underwent colonoscopic polypectomy and were clinically normal 22 months and 6 months postpolypectomy. One animal that was presented with chronic vomiting underwent gastric polypectomy and was clinically normal 21 months postpolypectomy. One animal with an incidentally discovered gastric polyp underwent polypectomy without complication.

Abdominal exploratory identified intestinal perforation in one case and gastrointestinal tissue trapped between the two foreign bodies adhered to each other in the second case. The foreign bodies were identified as magnets in one case and magnets and other metallic foreign bodies in the second case. Both dogs had excellent outcomes following surgical intervention. These cases demonstrate the danger of tissue entrapment between the foreign bodies as a result of the magnetic attraction between two objects. Dogs that are presented with a history of or are suspect for ingesting multiple magnets or a magnet and metal foreign bodies should be treated with surgical intervention because of the risk of gastrointestinal perforation as a result of magnetic attraction between the foreign bodies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Perforation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 10-year-old, spayed female basset hound was evaluated for a mass protruding from the vulva. The mass was excised, and a histological diagnosis of clitoral adenocarcinoma was made. No evidence of metastasis on thoracic radiographs or abdominal ultrasound was seen. Preoperative hypercalcemia resolved following excision of the mass. Cellular features were similar to an apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemistry exhibited features noted with apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma. No further treatment was elected by the owner. Internal iliac lymph-node metastasis was identified 4 weeks postoperatively, and hypercalcemia recurred 8 weeks postoperatively. The dog was euthanized 22 weeks postoperatively for signs related to hypercalcemia, including polyuria/polydipsia, lethargy, and weakness. A necropsy was performed and confirmed the presence of internal iliac lymph-node metastasis. The colon, rectum, and anal sacs were grossly and histologically normal.

One hundred and ninety-five miniature schnauzers were enrolled and divided into two groups based on whether they had normal (group 1) or increased (group 2) serum triglyceride concentrations. Serum cPLI concentrations were measured and compared between groups. A significant positive correlation was seen between serum triglyceride and cPLI concentrations (Spearman r=0.321; P&lt;0.0001). Miniature schnauzers with hypertriglyceridemia had a significantly higher median serum cPLI concentration (99.5 microg/L) than miniature schnauzers with normal serum triglyceride concentrations (median cPLI concentration 39.3 microg/L; P=0.0001). A cutoff value of 862 mg/dL was selected for serum triglyceride concentrations based on receiver operator characteristic analysis. Miniature schnauzers with severe hypertriglyceridemia (&gt; or =862 mg/dL) were 4.5 times more likely to have a serum cPLI concentration consistent with pancreatitis (&gt; or =200 microg/L) than miniature schnauzers with a normal serum triglyceride concentration.

The objective of this study was to determine if miniature schnauzers are more likely to be diagnosed with congenital PSS at an older age than are other breeds. This retrospective study examined the case records of 171 dogs diagnosed with congenital PSS; dogs were included if they were definitively diagnosed as having congenital PSS by nuclear scintigraphy, contrast portography, and/or exploratory surgery. Seven (23%) of 31 miniature schnauzers diagnosed with congenital PSS were 7 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis, compared to 3.4% for all other breeds. Miniature schnauzers had a relative prevalence ratio of 6.3 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 18.6; P=0.001) for being diagnosed at or after 7 years of age when compared to all other breeds of dogs. Clinical signs of congenital PSS may not manifest sufficiently to cause an owner to seek veterinary care for some dogs until they are older. Congenital PSS should be considered in mature dogs, particularly miniature schnauzers, that are presented with signs potentially consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portal System</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records from 30 client-owned dogs with acquired idiopathic laryngeal paralysis were retrospectively reviewed. All clients were contacted by telephone to obtain follow-up information regarding their dog. Six of the 30 surgeries required additional dissection (primarily around the craniodorsal aspect of the cricoarytenoid joint) after the initial intraoperative laryngeal examination. The procedures in 29 of the 30 dogs were deemed a success by the owners. Three (10%) dogs developed postoperative aspiration pneumonia. One of these dogs required long-term antibiotic therapy. Twenty-nine dogs returned to normal activity, and none of the dogs had any exercise intolerance associated with respiratory difficulties. Three owners reported that their dogs were able to swim, and one dog hunted postoperatively. Results of this study suggest that intraoperative laryngeal examination may help limit postoperative complications by allowing for direct, intraoral visualization of the arytenoid cartilage. This enables a surgeon to modify the soft tissue dissection around the cricoarytenoid joint to ensure that adequate abduction is apparent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arytenoid Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intraoperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumonia, Aspiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vocal Cord Paralysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Information was collected and reported from cases of canine thyroid cancer submitted to the VMDB between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2005. Odds ratio (OR) analysis was performed on breeds that had &gt; or =3% of the total number of dogs with thyroid cancer; ORs for each age category were also determined. Thyroid cancer represented 1.1% of all neoplasms during the time period of interest. Golden retrievers, beagles, and Siberian huskies all had significantly increased ORs for developing thyroid cancer. No sex predisposition was evident, but dogs between 10 and 15 years of age had a significantly increased chance of developing thyroid disease. Carcinomas and adenocarcinomas represented 90% of thyroid cancers, while adenomas represented 9.3%. Thyroid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma continue to be uncommon in our canine population. Older dogs are still more commonly affected, and this study is in agreement with previous studies that golden retrievers and beagles are overrepresented. A new finding is that Siberian huskies are also overrepresented. Carcinomas represent a much higher proportion of thyroid cancers than previously reported, and adenomas are likely incidental findings on necropsy. Thyroid cancer should be high on the list of differentials for a neck mass in older, large-breed dogs, as they make up 1.1% of the cancer cases reported. The overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are carcinomas, and they are most common in golden retrievers, beagles, and Siberian huskies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Odds Ratio</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of peritoneal effusion. Cytology of fluid collected by abdominocentesis revealed a large number of degenerate neutrophils with intracellular cocci. A diagnosis of septic peritonitis was made, presumably because of dehiscence of the anastomosis. Upon repeat exploratory celiotomy, the intestinal anastomosis (located 4 cm orad to the cecum) was found to be leaking intestinal contents into the abdomen. The distal ileum, cecum, and proximal colon were resected. An end-to-end, ileocolic anastomosis was performed and subsequently exteriorized into the subcutaneous space via a paramedian incision through the abdominal wall. The anastomosis was inspected daily for 4 days before it was returned to the abdomen and the subcutaneous defect was closed. Serial cytology of the peritoneal fluid, which was performed during this 4-day postoperative period, confirmed progressive resolution of peritonitis. The dog was discharged from the hospital 2 days following return of the anastomosis into the abdomen. Externalized intestinal anastomosis is used with good success in human medicine for repair of colonic injuries. In this case, externalization of the anastomosis permitted healing of the intestinal anastomosis in an environment isolated from the detrimental effects created by septic peritonitis. In addition, direct visualization of the anastomosis allowed assessment of healing. To our knowledge, this procedure has not been previously reported in companion animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascitic Fluid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ileum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Observed were severe normocytic, nor-mochromic, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Blood smears contained large, atypical cells with blue vacuolated cytoplasm, cytoplasmic blebs, round to oval central nuclei, and elevated numbers of cytoplasmic fragment resembling macroplatelets. Bi- and multinucleated atypical cells were found mainly in spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. A final diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMegL) was made based on morphology and positivity to the megakaryocyte-derived cell-specific markers von Willebrand factor and CD61. In case nos. 1 and 2, no treatment was initiated, and the dogs died on days 4 and 3, respectively. Case no. 3 received supportive therapy with prednisone, and after a brief improvement the dog died spontaneously 35 days after initial presentation. Only 11 cases of AMegL have been reported in dogs, and the specific diagnostic criteria have not been well established. The presence of vacuolization, cytoplasmic blebs, central round nuclei, cytoplasmic fragments, and multinucleated cells in these three cases were considered useful to differentiate AMegL from other hematopoietic neoplasms.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Integrin beta3</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>von Willebrand Factor</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The main presenting complaint was dyspnea, and no history of trauma was present. A tentative diagnosis of HH with secondary pleural effusion was made based on clinical signs and radiographic findings. Exploratory celiotomy revealed herniation of the gastric cardia, fundus, and body through the esophageal hiatus and an adjacent, distinct defect in the diaphragm. Rupture of the short gastric vessels lead to the formation of a hemorrhagic pleural effusion that impaired ventilation. The esophageal hiatus was surgically reduced in size, and the second defect was closed with nonabsorbable sutures. Esophagopexy and tube gastropexy procedures were also performed. The dog was clinically normal 9 months postoperatively. This type of HH is not currently defined within the traditional classification system and to the authors' knowledge has not been previously reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia, Hiatal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pleural Effusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two cats were euthanized, and their digits were harvested for histopathological evaluation on days 1, 3, and 7 post-onychectomy. Each digit was evaluated for total lesion width, total necrosis width, and degree of edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation. This study found few significant differences in collateral tissue damage between RF and CO(2) laser, but more incisional bridging by granulation tissue was noted with RF for feline onychectomies. These results indicate that RF for feline onychectomy is a reasonable alternative to CO(2) laser in regard to collateral tissue damage and bridging of the incision by granulation tissue. In addition, RF is not accompanied by the strict safety considerations and initial expense of acquisition of a CO(2) laser.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carbon Dioxide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Granulation Tissue</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hoof and Claw</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laser Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radio Waves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgery, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Weimaraners and long-haired cats of varying breeds, particularly Maine Coon cats, appear to be at higher risk of PPDH. Presenting complaints were most commonly related to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in both dogs and cats, although respiratory signs were more prevalent in cats, and gastrointestinal signs were more common in dogs. The most common herniated organs were liver, gallbladder, and small intestine. Mortality associated with surgical repair of PPDH in cats and dogs was low in the first 2 weeks postoperatively, and prognosis for return to normal function was excellent.

The purpose of this study was fourfold: to describe the range of clinical signs in dogs seropositive to A. phagocytophilum; to examine the prevalence of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in this population; to evaluate whether specific clinical signs were associated with coexposure to Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi in actively infected dogs; and to determine whether clinical response to doxycycline was complete in treated dogs. Medical records of dogs seropositive for A. phagocytophilum were reviewed retrospectively. Peripheral blood smears were also reviewed retrospectively for granulocytic Anaplasma morulae. Lethargy (81%), inappetence (58%), and lameness (50%) were the most common clinical signs, followed by fever (46%). Thrombocytopenia was the most common laboratory abnormality, and IMHA was diagnosed in three dogs. Dogs that were thrombocytopenic and had antibodies to both A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi had a median platelet count of 51,000/&#956;L (range 20,000 to 171,000/&#956;L), which was significantly lower than the count in dogs with antibodies only to A. phagocytophilum (P=0.04). Some dogs had an apparent relapse of clinical signs after an appropriate course of doxycycline. Testing for A. phagocytophilum by polymerase chain reaction, serum antibody assays, and/or blood smear evaluation should be considered in dogs with IMHA, cough, or epistaxis and that reside in A. phagocytophilum-endemic areas. If moderate to severe thrombocytopenia is present, testing for concurrent B. burgdorferi infection may be warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Borrelia burgdorferi</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxycycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ehrlichiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lyme Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroepidemiologic Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Treatments for both large- and small-cell GI lymphoma have been described previously; however, multiple chemotherapy protocols were used, a minimal amount of histopathological characterization was provided, and, in most studies, the majority of diagnoses were obtained via endoscopic pinch biopsies. Twenty-eight cats (24 with full-thickness intestinal biopsies) were diagnosed with small-cell GI lymphoma and treated with a combination of chlorambucil and glucocorticoids. The majority of cases were strongly CD3+, and many displayed epitheliotropism. The overall clinical response rate was 96%, with a median clinical remission duration of 786 days.

Cases were analyzed by breed, age, yr of diagnosis, tumor type, and location. The VMDB incidence of all intestinal tumors reported during this 40 yr period was 0.4%, with small intestinal tumors predominating. The most common intestinal tumor was lymphoma, but the most common nonlymphoid tumor was adenocarcinoma. The Siamese breed and increasing age after 7 yr conferred an increased risk. Intact males and females appeared to have a decreased risk compared with neutered patients, but this may be explained by the age difference among these patients as older patients were more likely to be neutered. Prospective studies evaluating neuter status predilection and prognosis are warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Age Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Castration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors report a case of a 4 yr old bitch with leishmaniasis treated with meglumine antimoniate during pregnancy. The pregnancy and delivery were normal and the bitch presented improvement of the infection during treatment. Three puppies died within 2 days of birth and tested negative via real-time PCR for L. infantum. The two surviving puppies were followed clinically, serologically, and by real-time PCR until 1 yr of age with no evidence of congenital leishmaniasis. L. infantum DNA was detected with real-time PCR analysis of uterine tissue from the bitch at the time of ovariohysterectomy. PCR analysis was performed after an ovariohysterectomy of the bitch that was performed two months after parturition. Meglumine antimoniate use in the pregnant bitch may have prevented vertical transmission of leishmaniasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antiprotozoal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmania infantum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmaniasis, Visceral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meglumine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meglumine Antimoniate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organometallic Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently published experimental and clinical data indicate that perioperative administration of DDAVP can minimize spread and survival of residual mammary cancer cells. The central aim of this study was to explore the effect of perioperative DDAVP and its relation to histologic grade in bitches with locally advanced mammary carcinoma. Of the 32 dogs initially recruited, 28 intact bitches with mammary carcinoma tumors stage III or IV were ultimately included. These dogs were randomized to receive DDAVP at intravenous doses of 1 &#956;g/kg (n=18) or saline solution as placebo (n=10). En bloc mastectomy of the affected gland(s) was performed. Tumor malignancy was graded by the method of Elston and Ellis into well-differentiated (grade 1), moderately differentiated (grade 2), or poorly differentiated (grade 3). DDAVP therapy significantly prolonged the disease-free survival (P&lt;0.001) and overall survival (P&lt;0.01) in bitches with grade 2 or 3 carcinomas compared with bitches in the control group. No significant difference in disease-free period or overall survival was found between treatment groups in bitches with grade 1 tumors. The present data suggest that DDAVP may be an excellent candidate as a surgical adjuvant in the management of aggressive cancers in small animals. More research in this field is warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deamino Arginine Vasopressin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemostatics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mammary Neoplasms, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perioperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All cats had severe hyperproteinemia due to hyperglobulinemia. Multiple myeloma or plasma cell neoplasia was diagnosed based on cytopathology and post mortem examination. The cats presented with signs of CHF including acute collapse, tachypnea, increased respiratory effort, and pulmonary crackles. All cats had heart murmurs and echocardiographic signs consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An enlarged left atrium was found in all cats and two of three cats also had spontaneous echocardiographic contrast. Plasmapheresis (centrifugal plasma exchange) was performed on all three cats by the removal of whole blood and the infusion of a balanced electrolyte solution while the whole blood was centrifuged and separated. The RBCs were then washed before being readministered to the patient. Plasmapheresis alleviated the clinical signs of CHF (tachypnea) in all three cats. Plasmapheresis should be considered in cases of CHF secondary to hyperviscosity syndrome to rapidly alleviate clinical signs associated with heart failure while diagnosis of the underlying cause is made and appropriate therapy implemented.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Viscosity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Failure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plasmapheresis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Low erythrocyte PFK activity together with low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations and a high hemoglobin-oxygen affinity confirmed the diagnosis. The PFK deficiency is due to a single missense mutation in the muscle-type PFK M-PFK gene in English springer and American cocker spaniels, whippets, and mixed-breed dogs; however, these PFK-deficient Wachtelhunds do not have the same PFK mutation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Erythrocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphofructokinases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasound examinations performed on both dogs revealed coalescing masses causing bilateral renomegaly. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations were physiologically inappropriate. Postmortem examinations revealed renal T-cell lymphoma in both dogs. One of the two dogs also had involvement of the liver and mesentery. EPO-immunohistochemistry on tissue samples demonstrated positive staining in tumor cells and occasional normal renal cells. This report illustrates that paraneoplastic EPO production may induce polycythemia. The pattern of EPO-immunohistochemistry staining suggested that the mechanism of production was due to tumor production of EPO and local hypoxia-induced EPO production from compression of normal renal cells and vasculature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Erythropoietin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma, T-Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polycythemia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In addition, the anatomy of the arterial supply of the cat's brain is reviewed. It is suggested that this unique arterial design may influence the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents in this species. Of the 16 cats reviewed, seven cats had ischemic infarctions, five had hemorrhagic infarctions, and four were diagnosed with intracranial hemorrhage. The median age was 8 yr and 9.5 yr in cats with infarctions and intracranial hemorrhages, respectively. Clinical signs were severe, acute, consistent with the localization of the cerebrovascular lesion, and influenced by underlying pathology. Four cats with infarction showed lateralized neurologic signs. Four cats with infarctions were diagnosed with pulmonary disease antemortem and three cats had hyperthyroidism. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and computed tomography scans were available in two cats. None of the infarctions were grossly visible. All cats with hemorrhagic infarcts had severe liver pathology and nephritis was identified in four cats. Hypoxia was a feature in four cats and one cat suffered cardiac failure. In conclusion, the clinical picture is influenced by the type of cerebrovascular disease, the localization of the intracranial lesions, and any underlying pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Ischemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cerebral Hemorrhage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cerebral Infarction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cerebrovascular Disorders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The etiology of primary uterine inertia is not well understood. The accurate diagnosis of primary uterine inertia requires the use of tocodynamometry (uterine monitoring).

Endoscopy has since been applied to many disciplines of medicine. Its application to the nervous system was initially slow and not widely accepted and mainly involved the biopsy of tumors and the treatment of hydrocephalus. Several reasons for neuroendoscopy's limited use include inadequate endoscope technology, high skill level required, the advent of the surgical microscope, and the development of other treatments such as ventricular shunting. Over the past 50 yr, improvements in optical glass lenses, fiber optics, and electrical circuitry has led to better equipment and a revival of neuroendoscopy. Neuroendoscopy is now used in many diseases in human medicine including hydrocephalus, neoplasia, and intracranial cysts. This review presents the history of neuroendoscopy, the equipment and technology used, and the possible translation of techniques currently used in human medicine to veterinary medicine.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuroendoscopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuroendoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurosurgery</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Overall, the ulnar graft techniques used in this study demonstrated excellent healing properties. Complications included recurrence of the tumor in 25% (2/8) of the dogs, metastasis in 50% (4/8) of the dogs, implant loosening in 37.5% (3/8) of the dogs, implant failure in 12.5% (1/8) of the dogs, and infection in 62.5% (5/8) of the dogs. Mean survival time was 29.3 mo (range, 9 to 61 mo). The mean metastasis-free interval was 33.67 mo (range, 8 to 54 mo). Tumors recurred locally in two dogs at 10 mo and 20 mo postoperatively. This study yielded similar long-term complications as other limb-sparing options (such as cortical allografts and metal endoprostheses) and allowed dogs to bear weight on the operated limb with acceptable limb function. More research is needed regarding specific healing times for ulnar vascularized grafts, time until implant removal, and the extent of radial bone that could ultimately be replaced by the ulna.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease-Free Survival</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostheses and Implants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radius</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ulna</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cultures were positive for bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Clostridium spp.) but negative for fungi. Due to the severity of the lesions, a complete left lung pneumonectomy was performed. Histopathological examination of the excised lung tissues revealed a severe granulomatous bronchopneumonia with numerous alveolar macrophages laden with structures stained positively by periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott stain that had morphology consistent with fungi. PCR and sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 from genetic material extracted from paraffin-embedded pulmonary tissue confirmed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.

Beagles were injected subcutaneously with 1-3 mg/kg LE-Hydro or 0.1 mg/kg hydromorphone. Dogs were evaluated for sedation, temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate. OVH dogs were injected with 2 mg/kg LE-Hydro subcutaneously or 0.2 mg/kg morphine and 0.05 mg/kg acepromazine intramuscularly. Side effects of LE-Hydro were within clinically acceptable limits. The analgesic efficacy was superior in dogs administered LE-Hydro at 12 hr postsurgically.

Samples were examined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen capture test. All ELISA-positive samples were subsequently examined for microfilaremia. All dogs were asymptomatic for Dirofilaria immitis infection, resided outside (except for winter in the Northern latitudes), not on prophylaxis for D. immitis, and had not traveled off of the reservation. Reservations were characterized by degrees of north latitude, true prevalence of D. immitis, and a reproductive index calculated by multiplying the number of months of the year in which infective stage larvae (L(3)) could develop in 30 days or less for each reservation by the 30 yr mean annual rainfall in centimeters recorded for that community. The prevalence of heartworm was directly related to the reproductive index on each reservation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dirofilaria immitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dirofilariasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indians, North American</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Medically Underserved Area</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Staging tests were negative for metastasis. The patient underwent a right, fourth intercostal thoracotomy, subtotal pericardectomy, right auricular mass excision, and pericardial free patch graft. The patient experienced blood loss during surgery, which required a packed red blood cell transfusion. The patient experienced transient arrhythmias postoperatively, but was discharged from the hospital 48 hr later. Histopathologic diagnosis of the mass was hemangiosarcoma. The patient was treated with carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy and palliative radiation therapy. The patient died at home, presumably from metastatic disease 260 days postoperatively. Surgical mass removal or debulking along with pericardial free patch grafting may be considered as palliative treatment options for dogs diagnosed with right auricular masses. In this case report, other techniques failed to repair the defect in the heart and a free patch graft offered a good rescue procedure with a favorable outcome without the need for inflow and outflow occlusion when used in conjunction with adjunctive therapies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Atria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pericardiectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracotomy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors evaluated a doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and vincristine (DAV) combination protocol in dogs with nonresectable stage II and stage III HSA. Twenty-four dogs were enrolled in this prospective, phase 2 study. Doxorubicin and dacarbazine were administered on day 1 while vincristine was administered on days 8 and 15. The protocol was repeated every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles or until disease progression. Toxicity and efficacy were assessed by clinical and laboratory evaluation and by questionnaires completed by the owners. Of the 24 included dogs, 19 were evaluable for response. The response rate (including five complete responses and four partial responses) was 47.4%. Median time to tumor progression was 101 days and median overall survival was 125 days. Significant toxicities were noted, including 41 high-grade hematologic and 12 high-grade gastrointestinal toxic events. Five dogs discontinued treatment due to chemotherapy-related toxicities, but no treatment-related deaths occurred. Multivariate analysis identified patient age (relative risk [RR], 2.3, P=0.049) to be negatively associated with time to progression whereas dacarbazine dose reductions (RR, 0.06, P=0.031) were positively associated with time to progression. Dacarbazine dose reduction was the sole factor positively associated with overall survival (RR, 0.28, P=0.015). In conclusion, the DAV combination appears to offer clinical responses and may prolong survival in dogs with advanced-stage HSA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chemotherapy, Adjuvant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dacarbazine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Progression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vincristine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Surgical decompression of the spinal cord is the preferred treatment. Localization of the compressive material is critical for surgical planning. Myelography has been used for localizing extruded disc material, but this procedure carries risk of complications. Computed tomography (CT) is becoming more available for use in veterinary medicine and CT myelography is used for localization of extruded disc material. This report compares CT with intravenous contrast medium and CT myelography for identifying extruded intervertebral discs.

A 4 yr old, male fox terrier presented with a 1 mo history of cough and exercise intolerance. Expiratory dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, irregular cardiac rhythm, and a grade 4/6 pansystolic cardiac murmur over the left cardiac apex were the most important features on physical examination. The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation. Thoracic radiographs showed left-sided cardiac enlargement and mild pulmonary edema, especially in the hilar area. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed severe left atrial dilation and a homogenous, echodense mass involving both leaflets of the mitral valve and the posteromedial papillary muscle, inducing mitral stenosis. Spectral Doppler echocardiography was consistent with severe left ventricular inflow tract obstruction secondary to a mass. Therapy for congestive heart failure was prescribed. Follow-up examinations of the dog 1 mo, 2 mo, and 6 mo after diagnosis showed an improvement in clinical signs, but similar echocardiographic features. Eleven months after diagnosis, the dog was euthanized at the owner's request because of recurrent congestive heart failure.

Resistance of third and fourth stage larvae of Dirofilaria immitis to macrocyclic lactones, lack of compliance, other unknown factors, or a combination of these reasons may be the cause of failure. A survey of members of a national hunting dog club was conducted to identify practices used to prevent canine heartworm infections. Questionnaires were completed by 708 dog owners. Year-round administration of heartworm preventive medication was reported by 208 (88%) respondents residing north of the 37th parallel. Dosing was based on the estimated weight of the dog by 54 (7%) respondents, 389 (55%) did not record the date prophylaxis was administered, and 89 (13%) observed the dogs spit out pills. Heartworm testing at least once per year was done by 556 (79%) respondents and test dates were spread throughout the year. Only 448 (64%) respondents tested newly acquired dogs for heartworm. These findings suggest that veterinarians should place a greater emphasis on the frequency and timing of heartworm diagnostic tests, the importance of weighing dogs, duration of administration, recording the date monthly heartworm prophylaxis is given, and observing dogs to ensure that oral medication is retained.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dirofilaria immitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dirofilariasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Filaricides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Macrolides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Patient Compliance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Population Surveillance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

After standard gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy showed normal mucosa, double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) was used via both oral and anal approaches. Gross changes consistent with inflammation in the jejunum were seen, and biopsy specimens were obtained. Histologic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of lymphocytic-plasmacytic jejunitis. Clinical remission of the disease occurred after 3 mo of therapy with prednisone, metronidazole, and a novel protein diet. Use of DBE has not been previously reported in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease, and isolated lymphocytic-plasmacytic jejunitis has not been described. The described cases of intestinal inflammatory disease diagnosed by conventional endoscopy were related to pathologic changes in the duodenum, ileum or colon, but not the jejunum. The main advantage of the DBE technique allowed examination of portions of the small intestine (jejunum) that were not commonly accessible by standard endoscopic techniques, and permitted a minimally invasive collection of biopsy samples compared with surgical biopsy. This case highlights the need to consider using DBE in animals with gastrointestinal disorders, whose symptoms are not readily explained by routine tests, conventional endoscopy, and dietary or therapeutic trials.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diarrhea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Double-Balloon Enteroscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Jejunal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphocytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plasma Cells</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is also found in several European countries. Anaplasmosis can manifest with a wide range of clinicopathologic findings. A 20 wk old puppy was presented with physical examination and laboratory findings atypical of the disease. In addition to other signs, abdominal effusion was detected. Diagnostic evaluation confirmed that the puppy was positive for anaplasmosis. No morulae were found in peripheral white blood cells, but morulae were apparent in the white cells of the abdominal effusion. Leukopenia was observed, characterized by neutropenia, as opposed to the lymphopenia and eosinopenia typically seen with the disease. Blast cells were also seen in the peripheral blood, and reactive lymphocytes were noted in the bone marrow. The patient responded well to doxycycline therapy. All hematologic and physical abnormalities resolved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anaplasmosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxycycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Seven additional atopic dogs received a daily spray containing similar ingredients to the spot-on. In all dogs, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured before and after treatment using a closed chamber device. In atopic dogs, a validated lesion score (canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index, CADESI) was determined and pruritus was assessed with a visual analog scale before and after treatment. The mean CADESI scores in atopic dogs decreased with the spot-on (P=0.0043) and with the spray (P=0.0366). Similarly, the pruritus scores decreased with the spot-on (P=0.266) and with the spray (P=0.0177). There was a significant difference between the TEWL values of healthy and atopic dogs on the abdomen (P=0.0181) and back (P=0.0123). TEWL decreased significantly on the back after treatment with the spray (P=0.016), but not on the abdomen (P=0.078). Adverse effects were not observed.

Ten dogs with osteosarcoma in six radii, two humeri, one tibia, and one ulna were evaluated. Macroslides, mediolateral radiographs, planar scintigrams, and sagittal images from SPECT scans were used to obtain measurements. On the scintigraphic images, the edges of the tumor were established using the activity profile imaging tool. The radiographic magnification was factored. The mean percentage of tumor size overestimation was 9.29% on mediolateral radiographs, 5.35% on planar scintigrams, and 33.25% on SPECT images. The correlation coefficient adjusted for sample size was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) for technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) hydroxyethylene diphosphonate (HDP) (75.5%) and radiography (61.3%) compared with indium 111-vitamin B(12) (28.3%). The correlation coefficient for (99m)Tc-HDP was higher than that obtained for radiographs; however, statistical difference between the two variables was not demonstrated (P&gt;0.05). (99m)Tc bone scan is a good estimator of intramedullary size of osteosarcoma in long bones when the activity profile tool to determine the margin of the tumor is used.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indium Radioisotopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organotechnetium Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radionuclide Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

After using peripheral nerve stimulation to confirm partial recovery of neuromuscular transmission, administration of 0.5 mg/kg IV of intravenous edrophonium failed to complete the reversal process. Subsequent administration of neostigmine resulted in complete recovery from blockade. Without monitoring neuromuscular function with a peripheral nerve stimulator until reversal was complete, it was very likely this patient would have been extubated with incomplete neuromuscular transmission. Several factors affecting the duration of neuromuscular blockade and its reversal are addressed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia Recovery Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edrophonium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neostigmine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuromuscular Blockade</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vecuronium Bromide</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Auscultation revealed cardiac murmurs both at the left and right hemithorax. Phonocardiography confirmed the systolic-diastolic nature of the left-sided and the systolic character of the right-sided murmur. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm; tall R waves and large T waves in lead II; and deep S waves in leads II, III, and aVF. Thoracic radiography demonstrated generalized cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary vasculature. Echocardiography revealed a perimembraneous ventricular septal defect with aortic insufficiency. Signs of biventricular volume overload, relative pulmonic stenosis, and pulmonary valve insufficiency were also seen as consequences of the defect. Necropsy demonstrated a ventricular septal defect just below the aortic valve, a dilated pulmonary trunk, dilated and hypertrophied ventricles, dilated atria, and rightward displacement of the aortic root. Cardiac histopathology showed ventricular cardiomyocyte degeneration (swelling and hypereosinophilia of the cytoplasm with a loss of cross striation, and nuclear hyperchromasia), cartilaginous metaplasia of the aorta, and subendocardial fibrosis of the right ventricular flow tract.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aortic Valve Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography, Doppler</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ocular lesions progressed despite aggressive medical treatment and were followed by cutaneous depigmentation and crusting along the nasal planum. Intensive oral and topical anti-inflammatory and topical antiglaucoma medications were administered, but the ocular disease progressed. A bilateral enucleation was performed. Uveodermatologic syndrome was diagnosed from histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy as well as histopathology of both globes after bilateral enucleation. To maintain control of the dermatologic lesions, oral azathioprine was initiated, but it was not well tolerated by this patient.

The present article describes the clinical, pathologic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the NCL in three longhaired Chihuahuas between 16 mo and 24 mo of age. Clinical signs, including visual defects and behavioral abnormalities, started between 16 mo and 18 mo of age. Cranial MRI findings in all the dogs were characterized by diffuse severe dilation of the cerebral sulci, dilated fissures of diencephalons, midbrain, and cerebellum, and lateral ventricular enlargement, suggesting atrophy of the forebrain. As the most unusual feature, diffuse meningeal thickening was observed over the entire cerebrum, which was strongly enhanced on contrast T1-weighted images. The dogs' conditions progressed until they each died subsequent to continued neurologic deterioration between 23 mo and 24 mo of age. Histopathologically, there was severe to moderate neuronal cell loss with diffuse astrogliosis throughout the brain. The remaining neuronal cells showed intracytoplasmic accumulation of pale to slightly yellow lipopigments mimicking ceroid or lipofuscin. The thickened meninges consisted of the proliferation of connective tissues with abundant collagen fibers and mild infiltration of inflammatory cells suggesting neuroimmune hyperactivity. Although the etiology of this neuroimmune hyperactivity is not currently known, MRI findings such as meningeal thickening may be a useful diagnostic marker of this variant form of canine NCL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs were diagnosed using myelography, computed tomography/myelography, or MRI, and dogs were classified as having either Hansen Type I disc extrusion or Hansen Type II disc protrusion located ventrally, ventrolaterally, or laterally within the cervical spinal canal. The most common clinical presentation was ambulatory tetraparesis and/or lameness (44%). The most affected sites for cervical IVDD were between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae (C6-C7; 78% of Hansen Type II discs) and C2-C3 (86% of Hansen Type I discs). Treatment was effective in 88% of dogs. Five large breed dogs (12%) did not improve. In dogs with a Hansen Type I disc extrusion, clinical signs improved in 96% of the cases. In dogs with a Hansen Type II disc protrusion, an excellent and good outcome was seen in 47% and 32% of cases, respectively.

The authors compared the diagnostic accuracy of a novel method of cytologic collection, termed core aspirate cytology (CA), with fine needle aspiration (FNA) and histopathology in 27 dogs with lytic and/or proliferative bone lesions. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed to confirm the diagnosis of OSA cytologically. OSA was accurately diagnosed in 85% and 95% of FNA and CA, respectively. ALP staining was 100% sensitive for the diagnosis of OSA. CA using a bone marrow biopsy needle allowed for penetration of cortical bone and aspirate cytology with a larger bore needle than FNA; however, there was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between techniques. Aspirate cytology with ALP staining was a safe, accurate, and minimally invasive diagnostic test for the evaluation of suspected OSA lesions in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Fine-Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Specimen Handling</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All dogs were fully assessed for metastasis with thoracic radiography, abdominal and/or cardiac ultrasound, and/or postmortem examination. Two dogs (8.7%) in group 1 had a concurrent cardiac mass. Neither of these dogs had pericardial effusion, and both were golden retrievers. Thirteen of the dogs in group 1 presented with a hemoabdomen. Concurrent intra-abdominal metastasis was noted in seven dogs. In group 2, 9/31 (29%) of the dogs had a concurrent splenic HSA, and 13/31 (42%) of the dogs had evidence of metastasis to another site. There was a significant association between age and the presence of nonsplenic metastasis (odds ratio, 0.457). The rate of concurrent right atrial mass detected by cardiac ultrasound in dogs with splenic HSA was 8.7%, which is less than previously reported.

The nongravid uterine horn was reflected caudally over the trigone, obstructing urine outflow. A cesarian section and ovariohysterectomy were performed. Postoperatively, the hematuria and pollakiuria resolved. Seventeen days later, the pelvic urethra was completely obstructed by a soft tissue mass that was identified by rectal palpation, blocked catheterization attempts, contrast radiography, ultrasonography, and surgery. Management included temporary cystostomy tube and definitive prepubic urethrostomy. Histologic diagnosis was severe, multifocal, necrosuppurative urethritis with fibroplasia, fibrosis, and cellulitis, apparently secondary to ischemia. Delayed urethral obstruction is a potential complication of canine uterine torsion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Torsion Abnormality</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterine Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neurologic examination abnormalities included ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, cranial nerve deficits, and changes in mentation. MRI in one patient revealed multifocal brain lesions; however, the MRI was normal in another one of the patients. Histopathologic evaluation identified multifocal neoplastic infiltrates in all three patients involving the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, with leptomeningeal extension in two of the three patients.

These consensus statements provide veterinarians with a new resource for improving patient care by emphasizing the value and scope of regular pet examinations. The two guidelines provide complete recommendations for comprehensive preventive healthcare programs, published as accessible, single-page documents. The guidelines are based on the subjective-objective-assessment-plan (SOAP) methodology of case management, a proven approach traditionally used with sick or injured patients. This logical and disciplined process is equally applicable to healthy patients and is designed to consistently deliver optimal patient care. The guidelines recommend visits for health examinations on at least an annual basis, recognizing that for many pets, more frequent visits may be appropriate, depending on the individual needs of the patient. The guidelines also provide detailed diagnostic, therapeutic, prevention, and follow up plans, to be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The inclusive content and concise format of the guidelines are designed to maximize their practical value and make them easy to implement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Advisory Committees</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Patients should be premedicated with drugs that provide sedation and analgesia prior to anesthetic induction with drugs that allow endotracheal intubation. Maintenance is typically with a volatile anesthetic such as isoflurane or sevoflurane delivered via an endotracheal tube. In addition, local anesthetic nerve blocks; epidural administration of opioids; and constant rate infusions of lidocaine, ketamine, and opioids are useful to enhance analgesia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system functions are continuously monitored so that anesthetic depth can be modified as needed. Emergency drugs and equipment, as well as an action plan for their use, should be available throughout the perianesthetic period. Additionally, intravenous access and crystalloid or colloids are administered to maintain circulating blood volume. Someone trained in the detection of recovery abnormalities should monitor patients throughout recovery. Postoperatively attention is given to body temperature, level of sedation, and appropriate analgesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia, General</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to determine the foreknowledge of lily toxicity of owners of cats that were exposed to lilies and to obtain historical, clinical and outcome information on the exposures. A survey was done of cat owners reporting indoor exposures to lilies to the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) during April 2009. Forty eight individuals, (57 cats) were included. Sixty nine percent of cat owners said they could recognize a lily and 27% knew that lilies were toxic prior to their cats' exposures. Most lilies were obtained from grocery or other stores, and were purchased by the owners or as gifts to the cat owners. Owners who were unaware of lily toxicity frequently left the flowers where the cats had access to them, whereas in households where the toxicity was known the cats actively sought out the flowers. Of the cats in this study 93% received prompt veterinary care, and 87% either developed no signs or had brief signs that resolved. Five percent had evidence of renal insufficiency at final follow-up and another 5 percent of cats were euthanized due to renal failure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergency Treatment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Environmental Exposure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Family Characteristics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Illinois</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lilium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Poisoning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poison Control Centers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Interpretation of biopsies from dogs with glomerular disease requires examination of at least 5-10 glomeruli, with at least two biopsies usually required for full evaluation. The purpose of this study was to compare quality and interpretability of renal biopsies obtained from healthy dogs with a large-gauge, vacuum-assisted biopsy instrument versus two biopsies obtained with a spring-loaded biopsy needle. Twenty dogs were randomized into two groups, and percutaneous, ultrasound-guided renal biopsies were evaluated using standard criteria. There were no significant differences in the number of biopsies that contained renal tissue, cortex, or medulla. Biopsies obtained with either instrument contained an adequate number of glomeruli and an equivalent number of arterioles and severity of tissue compression. Differences included easier penetration of the renal capsule and collection of sufficient tissue for interpretation with only one instrument pass when using the vacuum-assisted device (vs two passes required with the spring-loaded instrument). Before use in client-owned dogs, future studies should evaluate whether these differences are clinically relevant advantages in the diagnostic evaluation of dogs with kidney disease, and determine the prevalence and severity of complications when using this larger gauge device.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Doppler</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vacuum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

No standardized method of scoring an IDT has been described. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a correlation between a conventional, subjective IDT scoring method based on perceived wheal diameter, erythema, and turgor (0-4+) and an objective scoring method based on measuring wheal diameter alone. Thirty-four atopic dogs were skin tested with 68 different allergens. All skin tests were performed according to standard procedures, and any IDT score &#8805;2+ was considered clinically significant. When the subjective IDT scores were compared with the objective IDT scores in all dogs, there was a moderate level of correlation overall (r=0.457; P &lt;0.0001). The highest level of agreement between subjective and objective scores was noted with the reactions assigned subjective scores of "0" and "2+." Overall, there was a slight level of agreement between subjective and objective scores based on clinical significance (i.e., subjective scores &#8805;2+; &#954;=0.20; P &lt;0.0001). In conclusion, the authors believe that the objective scoring method used in this study may provide a point of reference for inexperienced individuals (dermatology residents, veterinarians, technicians) when learning to grade an IDT.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Allergens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis, Atopic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intradermal Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Research Design</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors cultured the preputial cavity of 60 dogs prior to and following flushing with 0.05% chlorhexidine diacetate, 1% povidone-iodine, or 0.9% saline control. Bacterial growth was evaluated using a semiquantitative method, and bacterial organisms were subsequently identified. There were no significant differences between povidone-iodine and the saline control in any of the variables assessed. Chlorhexidine resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of positive postflush cultures compared with povidone-iodine. Although not significant, the difference in adverse reactions between povidone-iodine (25%) and chlorhexidine diacetate (5%) suggests clinical relevance. Based on the results of this study, a 2 min flush with 0.05% chlorhexidine diacetate is recommended for presurgical preparation of the preputial cavity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Infective Agents, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chlorhexidine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flushing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Penis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Povidone-Iodine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Preoperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Wound Infection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Signalment, clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, and treatment options were evaluated. Review of medical records of dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital from 1992 to 2005 yielded four dogs with prostatic blastomycosis (PB) and four dogs with testicular blastomycosis (TB). Three of the four dogs with PB and all four dogs with TB had evidence of urogenital disease. Three dogs with PB had an elevated body temperature and all had systemic disease. All dogs with TB had a normal body temperature, and three had systemic disease and one had clinical signs limited to testicular disease. Cytology or histopathology was used to diagnose PB or TB. Treatment included itraconazole or fluconazole with or without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. PB and TB are infrequently recognized and may be under diagnosed due to failure to specifically evaluate these tissues. PB or TB should be considered in the evaluation and staging of male dogs with blastomycosis. Male dogs with urogenital signs should be evaluated via prostatic or testicular cytology or histopathology since proper identification and management of PB or TB may improve overall treatment success.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blastomyces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blastomycosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Illinois</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prostatic Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testicular Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eight dogs had bacterial pyoderma, five had hyperpigmentation, and four had thin skin. One dog had unresolved dermatophytosis. Skin lesions resolved after treatment in eight dogs. One dog was not treated and one was lost to follow-up. This study showed that skin lesions may be the only clinical signs of HAC. The presence of the more common clinical signs of HAC, such as a non-pruritic, truncal alopecia and/or thin skin, without any systemic signs of HAC and/or the presence of poorly responsive skin infections warrant screening for this disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Cortex Function Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Israel</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyoderma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fifty-two dogs underwent elective adrenalectomy and 8 dogs underwent emergency adrenalectomy for acute adrenal hemorrhage. Size of adrenal tumors ranged from 10 mm to 80 mm. Histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of adrenocortical tumor in 47 dogs, 26 of which were malignant. Pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in 11 dogs. Six dogs had tumor invasion of the caudal vena cava. Of the seven dogs that did not survive the perioperative period, four underwent emergency adrenalectomy. No dogs with tumor invasion of the caudal vena cava died perioperatively. Perioperative morality rates were 5.7% for dogs that underwent elective adrenalectomy and 50% for dogs that underwent emergency adrenalectomy for acute adrenal hemorrhage. Median survival time was 492 days for the 53 dogs that survived the perioperative period. Of the factors analyzed, only adrenal tumor size and the presence of acute adrenal hemorrhage had predictive values for perioperative mortality. Those dogs that survived the perioperative period had extended survival times of up to 1,590 days. The mortality rate associated with elective adrenalectomy in dogs may be lower than previously reported. Dogs with very large tumors or acute adrenal hemorrhage may have a more guarded prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Elective Surgical Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergency Treatment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ohio</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pheochromocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The other cat developed esophageal stricture, diverticulum formation, and suspected iatrogenic perforation. Both cats had signs of dysphagia and regurgitation beginning a few days after anesthesia. The first cat also had severe dyspnea due to septic pleural effusion and pneumomediastinum. In the second cat, endoscopy revealed diffuse esophagitis, an esophageal stricture, and a large esophageal diverticulum. Rupture of the esophageal wall occurred while inflating the esophagus for inspection. Due to the poor prognosis, both cats were euthanized. Necropsy revealed severe esophageal changes. Postanesthetic esophagitis has been previously described in dogs and cats; however, severe life-threatening esophageal injuries rarely occur as a sequel to general anesthesia.

Tracheobronchoscopy confirmed the presence of the tracheal mass at the thoracic inlet, and lymphoma was diagnosed based on uniformly atypical lymphoid cells on aspirated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The cat was treated with combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone. Thoracic radiographs and CT performed 1 mo after completion of the 6 mo chemotherapy protocol revealed resolution of the tracheal mass. The cat remained clinically normal at 21 mo after treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisolone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tracheal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vincristine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinicopathologic abnormalities were consistent with protein-losing nephropathy and renal azotemia. Expansive infectious disease testing implicated Babesia gibsoni via whole blood polymerase chain reaction. Renal histopathology results were consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and immune complex deposition. The dog was treated with azithromycin, atovaquone, and one dose of corticosteroids/cyclophosphamide. Three months after therapy was completed, the dog was clinically healthy, and all clinicopathologic abnormalities (including Babesia species polymerase chain reaction) had resolved.

Examination revealed a well-developed Cuterebra larva at the lateral aspect of the orbital cavity, anchored at the lateral canthus. The larva was manually removed under general anesthesia, and the eyelid margin was repaired. Systemic and topical antibiotics along with systemic anti-inflammatory treatment were instituted. The lesion healed completely, revealing a normal functional right eye 10 days after removal of the Cuterebra larva. Careful manual removal of the larva is recommended along with correction of any resultant conformational defects.

Abdominal radiographs revealed a possible gastric foreign body. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an edematous, tubular antral mass, which on further evaluation was determined to be a pylorogastric intussusception based on radiographic, endoscopic, and surgical findings. Spontaneous resolution of the intussusception occurred upon surgical exploration of the abdomen. Histopathology of a full-thickness gastric biopsy revealed vascular congestion consistent with an intussusception, but did not indicate the primary cause. The dog recovered uneventfully from surgery and had no further vomiting during the 6 mo follow-up period. This case was significant as it was the first report of pylorogastric intussusception diagnosed using endoscopy.

At presentation, ionized calcium was 1.91 mmol/L (NOVA Stat reference range, 1.1-1.3 mmol/L). Surgical excision of the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes was performed. Following surgery, symptomatic hypocalcemia was noted. Repeated ionized calcium measurements confirmed hypocalcemia, and hypercalcemia of malignancy panels suggested parathyroid gland suppression as the cause. The calcium normalized with parenteral calcium administration, but calcium later became elevated with tumor recurrence and an increase in the parathormone-related peptide. Disrupted calcium homeostasis is a potential complication following the treatment of long-standing humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anal Sacs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypocalcemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All dogs ate varying amounts of chicken jerky treats. All dogs were examined for similar clinical signs that included, but were not limited to, lethargy, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and altered thirst and urination. The quantity of chicken jerky consumed could not be determined; however, based on the histories obtained, the chicken jerky treats were a significant part of the diet and were consumed daily by all dogs. Extensive diagnostic testing eliminated other causes of the observed clinical signs, such as urinary tract infection and rickettsial disease. Glucosuria in the face of euglycemia or hypoglycemia, aminoaciduria, and metabolic acidosis confirmed the diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome. All dogs received supportive care, including IV fluids, antibiotics, gastroprotectants, and oral nutritional supplements. Three dogs exhibited complete resolution of glucosuria, proteinuria, and the associated azotemia; however, one dog remained azotemic, resulting in a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chickens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fanconi Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination revealed a large, midabdominal mass. Neurologic examination was normal at presentation. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a 215 cm(3) mass in the region of the right kidney. Forty-eight hours after IV injection of 370 megabecquerels (MBq, equivalent to10 millicuries [mCi]) of metaiodobenzylguanidine labeled with radioactive iodine ([(131)I]MIBG), standard planar scintigraphy was performed. A diffuse area of moderate uptake was noted in the midabdominal region. The dog experienced stable disease for 1.5 mo after injection based on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan; however, 5 mo after injection, repeat CT imaging revealed progression of the tumor, and a second IV injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of [(131)I]MIBG was administered. The dog died 3 wk after the second injection as a result of gastrointestinal blood loss that was believed to be caused by compression-induced bowel ischemia by the mass. A full necropsy was not performed, but the mass was removed for histologic evaluation, which confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. This report is the first to document the treatment of canine pheochromocytoma using [(131)I]MIBG.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infusions, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iodine Radioisotopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iodobenzenes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pheochromocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiopharmaceuticals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A clinical examination, complete blood cell count, enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for A phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis antibodies and Dirofilaria immitis antigen, and a polymerase chain reaction test for A phagocytophilum DNA were obtained for all dogs. Physical examination findings included fever, arthropathy, lymphadenopathy, epistaxis, acute gastritis, cervical hyperpathia, and central nervous system dysfunction. Complete blood cell count abnormalities included thrombocytopenia, morulae in neutrophils, anemia, leukopenia, eosinopenia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis. Seroreactivity to A phagocytophilum was found in 61%, B burgdorferi antibodies in 17%, and D immitis antigen in 5% of the dogs.

The purpose of this article is to report the presence of naturally occurring canine schistosomiasis in Kansas and to provide clinical details regarding schistosomiasis. Medical records of dogs diagnosed with schistosomiasis from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed, and information extracted included signalment, history, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, treatment, and outcome. Affected dogs were primarily medium to large breed and young to middle aged. All dogs were considered outdoor dogs, with three having known access to surface water. Common clinical signs included gastrointestinal disease and signs associated with hypercalcemia. Fecal flotation was negative in all dogs in contrast to fecal saline sedimentation and fecal polymerase chain reaction, which were both positive in all dogs in which it was performed. All dogs treated specifically for schistosomiasis fully recovered. This article describes the first reported cases of canine schistosomiasis in the Midwest and the first reported case of intestinal intussusception secondary to schistosomiasis. Recognizing that canine schistosomiasis is present in Kansas and possibly other Midwestern states should prompt veterinarians to perform appropriate diagnostic investigation in suspect animals as the diagnosis is straight forward and relatively inexpensive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kansas</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Schistosomiasis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sensitivities and specificities ranged from 50% to 70% and from 74% to 85%, respectively, for all laboratories. The &#954; index confirmed almost perfect agreement between laboratories. Variation in sample handling and processing by different laboratories should not be considered a primary factor when aberrant SBA values are encountered. Documenting agreement between laboratories is essential as inconsistencies could direct unnecessary medical or surgical intervention when patients are evaluated at different hospitals during the course of their disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bile Acids and Salts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biliary Tract Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Specimen Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laboratories</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Standards</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pedigree analysis in this line was also performed to identify a mode of inheritance. All dogs were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis; two of the three had congenital lesions in addition to primary infundibular stenosis. Two additional affected dogs were identified in the line, and pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Another, unrelated golden retriever was also identified with isolated infundibular stenosis in the record database. Primary infundibular stenosis should be considered in the differential diagnoses for golden retriever dogs with a left basilar systolic murmur, and is often associated with complex congenital cardiac disease. Primary infundibular stenosis may worsen in severity with time, and in this line of dogs an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is likely.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Subvalvular Stenosis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This retrospective study evaluated the ultrasound examinations of 26 cats with a histologic diagnosis of cholangitis. Most cats with cholangitis had sonographically normal liver size, echogenicity, and normal biliary systems. Statistically significant sonographic changes for cats with cholangitis included hyperechoic liver parenchyma, hyperechoic gallbladder contents, and increased pancreatic size. No statistically significant changes were noted to distinguish lymphocytic and neutrophilic forms of cholangitis.

Miniature and toy poodles were common breeds in the study population, and 79% of the dogs were male. The most common presenting sign was dyspnea (50%). Diagnosis was by fine-needle aspirate, which revealed a mucoid substance in 93% of dogs. Histopathology of the excised salivary glands revealed lymphoplasmacytic inflammation in all dogs that had histopathology performed. Forty-three percent of the dogs had a cervical mucocele on the same side as the pharyngeal mucocele. Surgical therapy was performed in 13 dogs, which consisted of excision of the mandibular and sublingual salivary glands, excision of the mucocele, or marsupulization of the mucocele. Only two dogs had recurrence of the pharyngeal mucocele. In this study, pharyngeal mucoceles occurred in predominantly small dogs that frequently presented with respiratory signs.

A 6 yr old Vizsla presented with a 2 mo history of a chronic draining wound on the right ventral thorax. Diagnostics revealed numerous fistulous tracts opening at a single site on the right ventrolateral chest wall, extending caudodorsally through the chest wall and diaphragm to the region of the right medial liver lobe. Exploratory laparotomy revealed the apex of the gallbladder adhered to the diaphragm with a tract of fibrous tissue extending along the diaphragm laterally to the right thoracic wall. Cholecystectomy was performed. The fistulous tract was incised to expose the lumen of the fistula, and the fistula was omentalized. Twenty-eight months after surgery, the dog had had no recurrence of the fistulous tract. Exploratory laparotomy allowed excellent visualization of the intra-abdominal path of the fistula and facilitated the ease of resection of the source. Cholecystectomy resulted in rapid and complete resolution of the fistula without the need for excision of the fistula. Although rare, gallbladder disease should be a differential for chronic fistulous tracts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biliary Fistula</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cholecystectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cutaneous Fistula</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ultimately, an appropriate and sustained response to immunosuppressive therapy may become the final diagnostic criterion used. Identifying associated disease processes, including breed-specific syndromes, remote infection, inflammation, drug exposure, vaccine exposure, or neoplasia, as well as initial response to therapy, is often an important contributor to prognosis.

A 14 yr old dog was evaluated for polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia, and abdominal enlargement. Adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism with concomitant left thyroid enlargement and a presumed abdominal metastatic lesion were diagnosed by an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Trilostane therapy was initiated and resolved the clinical signs for 2 yr at which time the dog presented with left testicular enlargement. The dog was euthanized and was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, an abdominal mass compatible with a metastatic lymph node, and bilateral interstitial cell testicular adenomas. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe the concomitant association of these types of endocrine neoplasms in a dog. The concomitant presence of these neoplasms could represent a potential variant of multiple endocrine neoplasia; however, the presence of the interstitial cell testicular adenomas may have only been an incidental finding. If any of these tumors are diagnosed, veterinarians should perform a thorough clinical assessment to evaluate for the presence of additional endocrine neoplasms or hyperplasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphatic Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare heat generated by two TPLO blade designs (Slocum Enterprises [SE] and New Generation Devices [NDG]), with or without irrigation, on cadaveric canine tibias. Thirty-six paired tibias were used to continuously measure bone temperatures during osteotomy through both cortices (i.e., the cis and trans cortices). Each pair was assigned to either an irrigation or nonirrigation group during osteotomy, and each tibia within a pair was osteotomized using a different saw blade design. Saw blade temperatures were recorded and temperatures were compared for all combinations of blade type, cortex, and irrigation. In the cis cortex group, the SE blade generated more bone heat than the NGD blade (P=0.0258). Significant differences in temperature generation between saw blade types were seen only when the osteotomy site was not irrigated (P=0.0156). For all variables measured, bone and saw blade temperature generation was lower with irrigation (P&lt;0.05). None of the osteotomies performed with either saw blade produced a critical duration of damaging temperature ranges in this study. Although saw blade design and irrigation influence heat generation during the TPLO, the potential for bone thermal damage during TPLO is low. The use of the NGD blade with irrigation is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hot Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Instruments</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pneumonectomy in dogs results in secondary changes in the remaining lung, which include: decreased compliance and vital capacity; and increased pulmonary vascular resistance potentially leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Such alterations make the anesthetic management of an animal with one lung particularly challenging. This report describes a dog with a history of left pneumonectomy due to Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia 3 yr before presentation. The dog presented with a vaginal wall prolapse, and surgical resection of the protruding vaginal wall, ovariectomy, and prophylactic gastropexy were performed. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol and was maintained with isoflurane using intermittent positive pressure ventilation and a constant rate infusion of fentanyl. Epidural anesthesia was also used. Recovery and postoperative management were uncomplicated. Intensive hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring and appropriate response and treatment of any detected abnormalities, taking into consideration the pathophysiologic alterations occurring in a pneumonectomized animal, are required for successful perianesthetic management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastropexy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perioperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumonectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterine Prolapse</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vital Capacity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The right inguinal space was surgically explored, and a large irregular mass resembling a fully developed testicle was identified in the right vaginal tunic. A second mass resembling an atrophied, but anatomically mature testicle, was identified in the left tunic. The larger mass was identified as a Sertoli cell tumor that had replaced all normal testicular tissue. The smaller mass was identified as a testicle that contained a small intratubular seminoma. The patient was diagnosed as having a phenotypic female sex, chromosomal male sex, and a gonadal male sex. Hormone assays completed before and after the gonadectomy and mass removal document an elevation of circulating progesterone presurgically that returned to baseline by 1 mo postsurgically.

Medical records were reviewed to identify all pet rabbits in which a mediastinal mass was diagnosed between Feb 2007 and Jan 2010. Signalment, history, clinical signs, diagnostic work-up (including laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the mediastinal mass), treatment modalities, survival time, and histologic findings were evaluated. Cytologic and/or histopathologic examinations revealed thymomas in all rabbits with mediastinal masses (n=13). Rabbits with thymomas showed clinical signs of dyspnea (76.9%), exercise intolerance (53.9%), and bilateral exophthalmos (46.2%). In seven rabbits the thymoma was removed surgically. Two rabbits were treated conservatively, and four rabbits were euthanized because of their poor clinical condition. The two rabbits that underwent surgery were euthanized 6 mo and 34 mo later. Mediastinal masses in rabbits appear to be more common than previously believed and consist primarily of thymomas rather than thymic lymphomas. Cytology of samples collected by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is an accurate diagnostic tool for the identification of thymomas in rabbits. Due to a high rate of perioperative mortality, intensive perioperative care and the provision of a low-stress environment are recommended for a successful thoracotomy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Concurrent clinical diagnoses were also noted and grouped into one of three following categories: neoplastic, inflammatory, or hematologic. There were no statistically significant differences in LN size between lateral views within each species. Enlarged sternal LNs were more cranially positioned in dogs than cats. No statistical difference was noted between right and left laterals, as to on which projection the enlarged sterna lymph nodes was seen best. Neoplastic disease (78.9%) was the most prevalent condition seen in association with LN enlargement in dogs, followed by primary infectious or inflammatory diseases (14.1%) and various hematologic conditions (7.0%). In cats, neoplasia was also most common (69.2%), followed by inflammatory diseases (30.8%). No hematologic conditions were noted in cats. The most common etiologic agent seen concurrently with enlarged sternal LNs in both dogs (33.8%) and cats (38.5%) was malignant lymphoma.

Three of the six dogs (50%) survived to the secondary closure and were subsequent discharged, which is similar to previous studies where the abdomen was either closed primarily or treated with open abdominal drainage. No major complications occurred with bandage management during hospitalization. The results of this study support VAC as a feasible technique for managing septic peritonitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgery, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vacuum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Examination revealed an emaciated condition and melena. Two masses were palpated in the cranial abdomen. Hematology and serum biochemistry exhibited a regenerative anemia and confirmed the presence of panhypoproteinemia, suggestive of a protein-losing eneteropathy. Distinct areas of thickened intestinal wall and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found on abdominal ultrasound. Cytology from those nodes showed the presence of suspected Cryptococcus spp., and infection was confirmed utilizing a cryptococcal antigen titer. Medical therapy with lipid-complexed amphotericin B and fluconazole was unsuccessful. Two surgical procedures were performed to remove the affected areas of intestine and lymph nodes, but the disease persisted as evidenced by a persistently elevated cryptococcal antigen titer. Terbinafine was prescribed, which resulted in complete resolution of clinical signs and a steadily decreasing cryptococcal antigen titer. Very few cases of intestinal cryptococcosis have been reported. In this case, infection resulted in a protein-losing enteropathy. In addition, this article describes the use of terbinafine in the treatment of intestinal cryptococcal infection in the dog, which has not been previously reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryptococcosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryptococcus neoformans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Fungal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Naphthalenes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Terbinafine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The database of Pet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center located in Minneapolis, MN, was searched for cases involving pimobendan toxicosis from Nov 2004 to Apr 2010. In total, 98 cases were identified. Of those, seven dogs that ingested between 2.6 mg/kg and 21.3 mg/kg were selected for further evaluation. Clinical signs consisted of cardiovascular abnormalities, including severe tachycardia (4/7), hypotension (2/7), and hypertension (2/7). In two dogs, no clinical signs were seen. Despite a wide safety profile, large overdoses of pimobendan may present risks for individual pets. Prompt decontamination, including emesis induction and the administration of activated charcoal, is advised in the asymptomatic patient. Symptomatic and supportive care should include the use of IV fluid therapy to treat hypotension and address hydration requirements and blood pressure and electrocardiogram monitoring with high-dose toxicosis. Practitioners should be aware of the clinical signs associated with high-dose pimobendan toxicosis. Of the dogs reported herein, all were hospitalized, responded to supportive care, and survived to discharge within 24 hr of exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiotonic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Charcoal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poison Control Centers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyridazines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to provide long-term follow-up for a large number of dogs surgically managed with this technique. A combination of medical record and completed client questionnaire information provided short-term (14 days) follow-up for 88 dogs and long-term (&gt;6 mo) follow-up for 42 dogs. Major short-term postoperative complications were identified in 3 of 88 (3.4%) patients. Major long-term complications were identified in 3 of 42 (7.1%) patients. The results of surgery were considered to be very satisfactory in 93% and unsatisfactory in 7%. Three dogs in this series developed aspiration pneumonia. Bilateral ventriculocordectomy through a ventral median laryngotomy is associated with a low incidence of both short- and long-term complications. Due to the ease of this procedure, the minimal surgical trauma to the patient, and the satisfactory results, this surgery should be considered an option for the treatment of idiopathic laryngeal paralysis in the dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arytenoid Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follow-Up Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laryngectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Larynx</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vocal Cord Paralysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Even in patients with frequent collapsing episodes due to cardiac causes, diagnostic surface electrocardiogram and 24 hr ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring are sometimes inconclusive. Event monitors with multiple leads can be challenging to use in veterinary medicine over long periods of time due to lead dislodgment. Implantable leadless loop recorders (ILRs) are useful, but owners are sometimes unwilling to have an ILR implanted due to the associated risks and/or costs. In this case report, the authors describe the use of cutaneously placed ILRs in two dogs with unexplained episodes of collapse/exercise intolerance. Data recorded provided clinically useful information. Cutaneously placed ILRs can be used effectively in veterinary medicine to evaluate patients with unexplained episodes of collapse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syncope</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Capsules made in-house containing either inert material or 15 mg of the licensed product and proprietary capsules (30 mg and 60 mg) served as controls. Findings were compared with regulatory specifications for the licensed product. Altogether, 96 batches of compounded trilostane and 16 control batches underwent analysis. In total, 36 of 96 (38%) compounded batches were below the acceptance criteria for content. The average percentage label claim (% LC) for each batch ranged from 39% to 152.6% (mean, 97.0%). The range of average % LC for the controls was 96.1-99.6% (mean, 97.7%). The variance in content of the purchased compounded products was substantially greater than for the controls (234.65 versus 1.27; P&lt;0.0001). All control batches exceeded the acceptance criteria for dissolution, but 19 of 96 batches (20%) of purchased compounded products did not. Mean percent dissolution for the purchased compounded products was lower than for controls (75.96% versus 85.12%; P=0.013). These findings indicate that trilostane content of compounded capsules may vary from the prescribed strength, and dissolution characteristics may not match those of the licensed product. The use of compounded trilostane products may therefore negatively impact the management of dogs with hyperadrenocorticism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dihydrotestosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Compounding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Industry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pharmacies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality Control</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the prognosis is excellent following surgical excision. There is a paucity of information in the veterinary literature regarding IML. Our objective was to describe the anatomical location, imaging techniques, and clinical findings in a series of dogs that were diagnosed and treated for IML. The prevalence of thoracic versus pelvic limb IML was not different. Most IML of the thoracic limb were located in the axilla. Operative time for IML of the thoracic and pelvic limb averaged 60 minutes. Complications were rare after marginal surgical excision and recurrence was not seen in any of the cases in this report. Intermuscular lipomas of the axilla are as common as IML of the caudal thigh. Surgical treatment of both axillary and caudal-thigh IML is associated with an excellent prognosis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soft Tissue Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The bulldog also had unilateral facial paralysis and sensory deficits of the trigeminal nerve on the ipsilateral side. Computed tomography and MRI scans suggested cholesteatoma in the bulldog, but showed only slight enlargement of the bulla in the pug. Histopathologic examination of samples yielded cholesteatoma in both cases. The authors suspect that development of the cholesteatomas was linked to the TECA/LBO surgery in both cases. Cholesteatomas may occur more frequently than currently thought. Even if only slight changes of the bulla wall are detected on CT, early-stage cholesteatoma should be considered. The narrow anatomic conditions in brachycephalic dogs possibly predispose such breeds to develop cholesteatoma after middle ear surgery because complete removal of all inflammatory and epithelial tissue can be more difficult than in other breeds. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an aural cholesteatoma causing sensory deficits of the trigeminal nerve.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cholesteatoma, Middle Ear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear, Middle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In humans with Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome, the counterpart of ACP, randomized trials show that IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) speeds recovery. The authors of the current study hypothesized that dogs with ACP would tolerate IVIg well and recover faster than dogs managed with supportive treatment only. Sixteen client-owned dogs with ACP were treated with IVIg, and 14 client-owned dogs served as a retrospective control group. Diagnosis was confirmed using clinical features, electrodiagnostics, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and muscle/nerve biopsies. The duration of the initial progressive phase, the time from IVIg administration until the dogs were ambulating without assistance, and the duration of the complete episode were evaluated. Adverse reactions (anaphylaxis, mild hematuria) were observed in two dogs. Dogs treated with IVIg were ambulating without assistance after a median of 27.5 days (range, 15-127 days) from onset of clinical signs. The control group was ambulatory without assistance at a median of 75.5 days (range, 5-220 days). Even though this result is not statistically significant, there is a clear trend toward faster recovery in dogs treated with IVIg.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunoglobulins, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyradiculoneuropathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Walking</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At surgery, adhesions to the right kidney were dissected, allowing the right kidney to be preserved. The tumor showed extensive invasion into the suprarenal vena cava. It was felt that thrombus removal via venotomy could not be performed. Instead, the vena cava was ligated caudal to the liver and cranial to the right renal vein. The neoplastic gland was then excised en bloc together with the portion of the invaded caudal vena cava. Hind limb edema had developed preoperatively and increased transiently in the first days postoperatively. The animal was discharged 6 days postoperatively with no other clinical disorders, and hind limb edema resolved over time. Histopathology identified a pheochromocytoma. The dog died 49 mo later. A neoplastic thrombus of the vena cava may require venotomy to allow thrombus removal. Occasionally, removal of the thrombus by venotomy may prove impossible. In such a situation, en bloc removal of the concerned portion of the vena cava may be performed with a good long-term outcome provided that gradual occlusion of the vena cava by the thrombus has allowed time for collateral circulation to develop.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Invasiveness</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nephrectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pheochromocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Renal Veins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vena Cava, Inferior</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Urinary organic acids were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and were consistent with a diagnosis of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L2HGA). The L2HGDH gene encodes for the enzyme L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which helps break down L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid. In both puppies described in this report, a homozygous mutation at the translation initiation codon of the homolog canine L2HGDH gene was detected (c.1A&gt;G; p.Met1?), confirming the diagnosis of L2HGA at the DNA level.

Physical examination revealed pain on opening the jaw, and otoscopic examination showed tympanic membrane rupture associated with hyperplastic tissue at the entrance of the middle ear. Standard MRI sequences allowed for the identification of a severely expanded bulla containing material that was isointense to brain tissue on T1-weighted images and of mixed intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. No postcontrast enhancement of the content was present, but the lining of the bulla was partially enhanced. The images allowed evaluation of the surgical margins and the secondary changes due to the expansion of the mass. Surgery was performed and histopathology confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of cholesteatoma.

Twenty animals, randomly divided into two groups, received either epidural (EPI) or intramuscular (IM) tramadol (2 mg/kg) 30 min before anesthetic induction. Analgesia, sedation, cardiorespiratory parameters, end-tidal isoflurane, blood catecholamines and cortisol, and arterial blood gases were measured at different time points up to 24 hr after agent administration. There were no differences between the two groups regarding cardiorespiratory parameters, end-tidal isoflurane, and pain scores. Two dogs in the IM and one in the EPI group required supplemental analgesia. Cortisol was increased (P&lt;0.05) at 120 min (3.59 &#956;g/dL and 3.27 &#956;g/dL in the IM and EPI groups, respectively) and 240 min (2.45 &#956;g/dL and 2.54 &#956;g/dL in the IM and EPI groups, respectively) compared to baseline. Norepinephrine was also increased (P&lt;0.05) at 120 min in both groups compared to baseline values. Epinephrine values were higher (P&lt;0.05) in the IM group compared with the EPI group at 50 min, 120 min, and 1,440 min after tramadol administration.

Signs included seizures, circling, and behavior changes. MRI demonstrated extra-axial, contrast-enhancing, multiloculated, fluid-filled, cyst-like lesions with a mass effect, causing compression and displacement of brain parenchyma. Differential diagnoses included cystic neoplasm, abscess or other infectious cyst (e.g., alveolar hydatid cyst), or fluid-filled anomaly (e.g., arachnoid cyst). The cyst-like lesions were attached to the rostral falx cerebri in all cases. In addition, case 2 had a second polycystic mass at the caudal diencephalon. Surgical biopsy (case 3 with a single, rostral tumor via transfrontal craniectomy) and postmortem histology (in cases 1 and 2) confirmed polycystic meningiomas. Tumor types were transitional (cases 1 and 3) and fibrous (case 2), with positive immunohistochemical staining for vimentin. Case 3 was also positive for E-cadherin, s100, and CD34. In all cases, staining was predominantly negative for glial fibrillary acid protein and pancytokeratins, supporting a diagnosis of meningioma. This report describes the first cases of polycystic meningiomas in dogs. Polycystic meningiomas are a rare, but important, addition to the differential diagnoses for intracranial cyst-like lesions, significantly affecting planning for surgical resection and other therapeutic interventions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cysts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningeal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningioma</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is important for the practitioner to understand how clinical information is collected, analyzed, and communicated in journals and presentations at conferences. Clinical research is either retrospective in observational studies, looking at historical medical records as the source of data, or prospective in both experimental and observational studies, where the study is designed before any patients are included. Prospective, experimental studies provide the more reliable results, although they form a minority of published reports. Randomized, controlled trials are the most reliable format, and attempts should be made to use this design more often in veterinary medicine. Care must be taken in the conduct of clinical research to reduce sources of bias that can yield false findings, particularly in small, retrospective studies. Statistical analysis is the key to data interpretation, but must be applied appropriately to avoid either wrong assumptions or misconception.

Transverse T2-weighted images identified a type II split cord malformation (i.e., diastematomyelia) in the thoracic spine. Split cord malformations are forms of spinal dysraphism where the abnormal development of spinal cord results in sagittal splitting of a portion of the cord into two hemicords. The location of the lesion in the thoracic spine was consistent with the dog's clinical signs of an upper motor neuron bladder. Split cord malformations that occur in humans have similar MRI characteristics and can result in similar clinical signs as those identified in the dog described in this report.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nervous System Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neural Tube Defects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical signs of left-sided vestibular and general proprioceptive ataxia and cranial nerve VII dysfunction in the Saint Bernard suggested a lesion affecting the brain stem. Signs in the rottweiler consisted of general proprioceptive/upper motor neuron paraparesis, suggesting a lesion involving the third thoracic (T3) to third lumbar (L3) spinal cord segments. MRI was normal in the Saint Bernard, but an intra-axial lesion involving the T13-L2 spinal cord segments was observed in the rottweiler. In both dogs, the central nervous system (CNS) contained neoplastic cells with features consistent with gliomatosis cerebri (GC). In the Saint Bernard, neoplastic cells were present in the medulla oblongata and cranial cervical spinal cord. In the rottweiler, neoplastic cells were only present in the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry disclosed two distinct patterns of CD18, nestin, and vimentin staining. GC is a rarely reported tumor of the CNS. Although GC typically involves the cerebrum, clinical signs in these two dogs reflected caudal brainstem and spinal cord involvement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Stem Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunohistochemistry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to (1) better establish the pathogenicity of Corynebacterium spp. in otitis utilizing reported criteria and by assessing clinical response to antibiotic therapy and (2) to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Corynebacterium spp. associated with otitis. The study was retrospective, targeting cultures positive for Corynebacterium spp. Corynebacterium spp. were part of mixed microbial populations in 79/81 cultures. Corynebacterium spp. pathogenicity was highly questionable because of their almost invariable presence with other microbes and the observation that Corynebacterium spp. usually disappear from the ear with resolution of other infections, even when the Corynebacterium spp. are resistant to the prescribed antibiotic(s). However, 2/81 cultures came from two canine ears wherein Corynebacterium spp. may have been pathogenic. Antimicrobial sensitivities for Corynebacterium spp. were available for 54 isolates. Most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol (53/54), amikacin (50/54), tetracycline (50/54), gentamicin (46/54), and enrofloxacin (32/54). Among those antibiotics available in otic products, gentamicin and enrofloxacin would be rational choices for the empirical, topical therapy of Corynebacterium spp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Externa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Drugs tested were amoxicillin (AMX), amoxicillin trihydrate/clavulanate potassium (AMXC), cefpodoxime (CFP), doxycycline (DXY), enrofloxacin (ENR), gentamicin (GM) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS). Urinary isolates were most common (n = 174). Percent resistance was greatest for isolates from the respiratory tract, urine, and skin compared with the ear. Resistance was also greatest for samples sent from the south and central states compared with the western states (P &#8804; 0.001). Percent resistance by drug was AMX (46 &#177; 2.6%) &gt; AMXC (37 &#177; 2.5%) &gt; CFP (21.8 &#177; 2%) = DXY (22 &#177; 2.1%) = ENR (20 &#177; 2.1%) = TMS (19 &#177; 2%) &gt; GM (12 &#177; 1.7%). There was a significant difference in resistance between the different antibiotic drugs (P &#8804; 0.001). Population MIC distributions were bimodal, and MICs were highest in samples from the southern states (P &#8804; 0.001). E. coli resistance may limit its empirical treatment.

Two of the dogs were diagnosed with blastomycosis (one with disseminated disease and the other with the disease localized to the left eye). The third dog was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. None of the dogs originated from, or had traveled to, typical regions endemic for these fungal diseases. All diagnoses were established from histopathology and either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or cytology and culture. The two dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis were treated with either itraconazole or ketoconazole with apparent resolution of the infections. The dog with ocular involvement had an enucleation prior to beginning therapy. The dog diagnosed with histoplasmosis was euthanized without treatment.

Although its radiographic appearance has been described previously, radiographs alone do not provide detailed information about the tendon parenchyma. Tendon ultrasonography has been widely applied for the diagnosis of human tendinosis, but it remains underused in dogs. This article reviews the ultrasonographic technique and variable appearance of canine supraspinatus calcifying tendinosis observed in 33 tendons. The ultrasonographic findings are described. The most common ultrasonographic finding was a hyperechoic area accompanied by distal acoustic shadowing. No relationship with bicipital tenosynovitis was found. A color Doppler examination was possible in only five of the tendons, revealing no blood flow in those tendons. There was evidence that the presence of a hypoechoic area surrounding the calcification was related to clinical signs of pain, suggesting an active inflammatory process. Ultrasonography was an excellent technique to evaluate lesions of the supraspinatus tendon and it revealed details not apparent on radiographs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendinopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendon Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tendons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Serum biochemistry revealed persistent hypokalemia. A left adrenal gland mass with right adrenal atrophy was detected ultrasonographically. Basal serum cortisol concentration was at the low end of normal (30 nmol/L; reference range, 30-140 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol concentration was low (199 nmol/L; reference range, 220-470 nmol/L). Basal serum 17-&#945;-OH progesterone concentration was also low (0.03 ng/mL; reference range, 0.06-0.30 ng/mL), but the aldosterone concentration 2 hr after the ACTH stimulation was elevated (&gt; 3,000 pmol/L; reference range, 197-2,103 pmol/L). A left adrenalectomy and nephrectomy were performed. Histopathology revealed an adrenocortical zona glomerulosa carcinoma. Surgical excision was considered incomplete; however, clinical signs resolved. Two years later, basal and ACTH-stimulated aldosterone concentrations were elevated. Computed tomography demonstrated a mass effect in the liver. The left lateral and left medial hepatic lobes were removed. Histopathology confirmed metastatic endocrine carcinoma.

<Rec><Common><PMID>23033465</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Biomechanical testing of locking and nonlocking plates in the canine scapula.</Title>	<Abstract>Locking plates have been shown to offer improved fixation in fractures involving either osteoporotic bone or bone with lesser screw pullout strength, such as thin and flat bones. Fractures of the scapular body are one type of fracture where the screw pullout strength using conventional plate fixation may not be sufficient to overcome physiologic forces. The purpose of this study was to compare the pullout strengths of locking plates to conventional nonlocking plates in the canine scapula. A 2.7 mm string of pearls plate (SOP) and a 2.7 mm limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) were applied with similar divergent screws to the supraspinatus fossa of the scapula. Forces perpendicular to the plates were applied and both the loads at failure and modes of failure were recorded. No differences were noted in loads at failure between the two plating systems. Although the modes of failure were not significantly different, the SOP constructs tended to fail more often by bone slicing and coring, whereas the LC-DCP constructs failed primarily by screw stripping. Neither of the plate systems used in this study demonstrated a distinct mechanical advantage. The application and limitations of locking plate systems in various clinical situations require further study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Plates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Screws</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fracture Fixation, Internal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Materials Testing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scapula</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stress, Mechanical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tensile Strength</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Subsequent evaluation the following day determined the dog to have pericardial effusion. Muffled heart sounds and jugular pulses were noted on physical exam, and the dog was diagnosed with pleural and pericardial effusion. A sinus rhythm with a rate of 142 beats/min was documented on a surface electrocardiogram (EKG). Following pericardiocentesis, the heart rate increased to 260 beats/min, the rhythm became irregular, and the systemic blood pressure decreased. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was confirmed by EKG. Procainamide was administered IV over 15 min, resulting in successful conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and clinical improvement. Procainamide is one of several antiarrhythmic medications that are used for the conversion of acute AF in humans; however, its utility and efficacy in dogs in the setting of AF has not previously been reported. This case highlights a unique complication of performing a pericardiocentesis that requires immediate treatment and describes a potential treatment option for the conversion of acute AF in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Arrhythmia Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atrial Fibrillation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pericardial Effusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pericardiocentesis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Procainamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At surgery, a 20 cm, smooth, intact mass associated with the left ovary and multiple 1-2 cm irregular masses in the broad ligament were found. The masses were surgically removed and submitted for histopathology. A histologic diagnosis of a teratoma and a GCT with broad ligament metastasis was made. Further treatment was elected by the owner and included two cycles of carboplatin therapy. The dog was euthanized 6 wk postoperatively for signs related to metastasis and dyspnea. Teratoma of the ovary, although it contains derivatives of all three embryonic germ cell layers, rarely presents together with either ovarian epithelial or sex cord-stromal tumors.

Medical records of dogs (n = 10) and cats (n = 5) that had a laparoscopic splenic biopsy performed as part of their diagnostic evaluation for systemic disease were evaluated. Splenic biopsies were performed with the patient in dorsal recumbency using a two-portal approach. In some cases, concurrent organ biopsy was also performed. A pair of 5 mm cup biopsy forceps was used for biopsy collection, and an absorbable gelatin hemostatic sponge was placed at the biopsy site to aid in hemostasis. All patients recovered without major complications. Conversion to an open surgical approach was not required. Median survival time was 180 days, and nine patients were alive at the time of manuscript preparation. Four patients were diagnosed with neoplasia; however, only one had neoplasia involving the spleen. Median survival time for the nonneoplasia group (n = 11) was 300 days. Eight of those patients were alive at time of manuscript preparation. Minimal morbidity was observed in this cohort of clinical patients.

The benefits of the combined approach should not be achieved at the expense of specimen quality. In this study, core bone marrow samples obtained from the proximal humerus of 26 dogs by a combined technique immediately posteuthanasia were compared with core samples obtained directly from the opposite humerus. Both core samples from each dog were compared for relative overall quality. Biopsies were unsuccessful in four dogs using the combined technique and in one dog by the direct technique. Marrow length was shorter and hemorrhage artifact was more common using the combined technique. There were no differences in cellularity, megakaryocyte count, the myeloid/erythroid ratio (M/E ratio), iron stores, or diagnostic quality. Direct core biopsy remains the ideal technique; however, the degree of compromise was small in the samples obtained from the combined technique.

Prolongations of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin clotting time (TCT) together with fibrinogen assay results of either no or trace amounts of fibrinogen support a diagnosis of afibrinogenemia. Differential diagnoses include common coagulopathies, liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Either aggressive cryoprecipitate or plasma transfusions are required to treat afibrinogenemia. The current guidelines for treatment of coagulopathies include plasma transfusions (either 15-30 mL/kg or until both PT and aPTT are normalized). This report describes a case in which bleeding persisted 2 days after standard plasma transfusion levels were administered and PT and aPTT levels had normalized. In this case, the bleeding was stabilized for up to 2 mo after administering &gt; 54 mL/kg plasma. In human medicine, either cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate is used to increase blood fibrinogen levels to 100 mg/dL for minor bleeding and 200 mg/dL for major bleeding.

The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed description of an intrapericardial technique for PDA dissection and ligation and to report the clinical outcome of that technique in dogs. Medical records of 35 dogs were retrospectively reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, echocardiographic findings, surgical time, intra- and postoperative complications, and completeness of ductal closure. Median surgery time was 60 min (range, 35-125 min). Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications occurred. Within 48 hr of surgery, the continuous left basilar heart murmur was absent in all dogs, and complete echocardiographic closure was confirmed in 29 of 32 dogs. Residual flow was identified echocardiographically in three dogs within 48 hr of surgery. Residual flow was decreased in one dog at 1 mo, which resolved within 33 mo. One dog had mild residual flow postoperatively but did not return for follow-up. The intrapericardial technique was successful for PDA dissection and ligation and had a lower rate (6%) of echocardiographic residual flow compared with previously reported techniques.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiac Surgical Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ductus Arteriosus, Patent</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Between Jan 1, 2005 and Jun 1, 2006, all samples were analyzed using two different portable analyzers (devices A and B), and 86 of those samples were also analyzed by a reference laboratory (REF). The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for device A and the REF was 0.949 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.923-0.966). For device B and REF, the CCC was 0.990 (95% CI, 0.985-0.993). Only 8 of 85 samples (9.4%) exceeded a relative difference of 20% for device B (note that 1 of the 86 samples was not included because the lactate level fell below the detectable limit of device B), but 48 of 85 samples (56.5%) exceeded a relative difference of 20% for device A. Both portable lactate analyzers appeared to be effective in detecting clinically significant elevations in plasma lactate compared with the REF but device B had better agreement. A positive correlation among all three analyzers existed; however, the analyzers do not yield directly interchangeable results.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoxia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sixteen predetermined categories of abnormal radiographic findings were evaluated in 233 small breed dogs. In total, 9,786 possible permanent teeth could be evaluated. Of those, 8,308 teeth were evaluated and abnormal radiographic findings were found in 2,458 teeth (29.6%). The most common teeth with abnormal radiographic findings were the mandibular first molars (74.5% on the left and 63.9% on the right) and the maxillary fourth premolars (40.5% on the left and 38.2% on the right). Bone loss of any type (15.8%) was the most commonly detected radiographic abnormal finding among the 16 categories. Dental conditions with a genetic predisposition were frequently occurred in the mandibular premolar teeth. Shih tzu frequently had unerupted teeth and dentigerous cysts. Among the teeth with abnormal radiographic findings, 4.5%, 19.8%, and 5.3% were considered incidental, additional, and important, respectively. Findings that were only detected on radiographs, which were not noted on routine oral examination, were more common in older dogs. Full-mouth radiographic evaluation should be performed to obtain important information for making accurate diagnoses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mouth Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Panoramic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tooth</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tooth Abnormalities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tooth Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Tachycardia, tachypnea, dehydration, and abdominal pain were present on physical examination. Abdominal radiographs showed a foreign object (golf ball) in the fundus of the stomach, and a larger, round, soft-tissue opacity mass in the region of the pylorus. Endoscopic removal of the foreign object was unsuccessful. A large soft-tissue mass (duodenogastric intussusception) was visualized with endoscopy, but was not correctly diagnosed until surgery. A midline exploratory celiotomy was performed and the duodenogastric intussusception was diagnosed and manually reduced. Severe pyloric wall edema and minimal bruising were present. A routine fundic gastrotomy was performed and the foreign object was removed. A right-sided incisional gastropexy and duodenopexy were performed in attempt to prevent recurrence of the intussusception. The dog was discharged from the hospital 38 hrs after surgery, and was normal on follow-up 1 yr after surgery. The dog in this report is the sixth documented case of duodenogastric/pylorogastric intussusception in the veterinary literature. This is the first reported case with a concurrent gastric foreign body and endoscopic visualization of the intussusception.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Duodenal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intussusception</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This report describes the clinical presentation and oncologic outcome for four dogs with this rare presentation. All cases presented to the authors following a history of unilateral lameness for several weeks. On presentation, case 1 had pain elicited in the contralateral proximal humerus but all the other cases had no abnormalities detectable on physical examination of the contralateral limb. All dogs had technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) nuclear scintigraphy performed that identified bilateral lesions of the distal radii in two dogs, proximal humeri and distal tibiae in one dog each. Thoracic radiographs performed on all dogs showed no evidence of pulmonary metastases. Three dogs were treated with palliative radiation therapy (two dogs received concurrent bisphosphonates) resulting in survival times from initial presentation of 50 days, 193 days, and 523 days, respectively. One dog had stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) and a surgical limb-salvage performed followed by carboplatin chemotherapy, resulting in a survival time of 926 days from initial presentation. Palliative and curative-intent treatments for the bilateral synchronous appendicular bone tumors resulted in survival times similar to those reported for treatment of a single primary appendicular bone tumor.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Extremities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palliative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Technetium Tc 99m Medronate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical signs included anorexia, exercise intolerance, and severe loss of body condition. Clinical examination revealed dyspnea, pale mucous membranes, and weak femoral pulses. Pleural and abdominal effusions and iron deficiency anemia were identified. A distended intrathoracic caudal vena cava (CVC) visible on thoracic radiographs suggested that the modified transudate abdominal effusion was the result of improper venous return to the right side of the heart. Cor triatriatum dexter (CTD) was diagnosed via echocardiography but did not explain all the anomalies detected during a contrast echocardiography. Abnormal communications between the CVC and azygos vein and the CVC and thoracic duct were subsequently identified by abdominal ultrasonography and angiography. Medical management with diuretics, iron supplements, and surgical treatment of CTD resulted in normalization of the respiratory rate, the exercise intolerance, and the anemia. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of CTD associated with shunts between the CTV and both the azygos vein and thoracic duct in dogs.

The patient developed pancreatitis and nonseptic suppurative peritonitis 24 hr after surgical resection of the insulinoma and was managed medically until discharge. Three mo after surgery, the dog was diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) that was effectively managed with parenteral pancreatic enzymes. Due to normal glucose levels 3 mo postsurgically, liver samples from the initial surgery were resubmitted for immunohistochemistry. Results confirmed insulinoma metastasis with insulin expression. Ten mo postsurgically, the blood glucose was normal and serum insulin levels were slightly above the upper reference limit. The first hypoglycemic episode was documented 23 mo postoperatively, which was effectively managed with prednisone. The cause for the prolonged disease remission and survival was unknown, but was possibly a result of pancreatitis and peritonitis, partial spontaneous regression of metastatic lesions, or idiopathic. Despite life-threatening postoperative complications, this patient enjoyed a profoundly longer than expected survival. This case highlights the importance of removing the primary tumor (insulinoma) despite the presence of metastatic disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to determine if puppies that attended puppy socialization classes and were vaccinated by a veterinarian at least once were at an increased risk of confirmed canine parvovirus (CPV) infection compared with puppies that did not attend classes and to determine the frequency of suspected CPV infection in puppies vaccinated at least once that attended classes with trainers. Twenty-one clinics in four cities in the United States provided information regarding demographics, vaccination, CPV diagnosis, and class attendance for puppies &#8804; 16 wk of age. In addition, 24 trainers in those same cities collected similar information on puppies that attended their classes. In total, 279 puppies attended socialization classes and none were suspected of or diagnosed with CPV infection. Results indicated that vaccinated puppies attending socialization classes were at no greater risk of CPV infection than vaccinated puppies that did not attend those classes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parvoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parvovirus, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Assessment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Over the last several years, a new generation of nonabsorbable, multifilament, polyblend polyethylene orthopedic suture materials have been evaluated for use in the lateral fabellar suture (LFS) technique for surgical treatment of CCLR. This retrospective study compared the short-term outcome of 16 dogs that were treated using the LFS technique using either a proprietary polyblend polyethylene orthopedic suture material (FW) or monofilament nylon leader line (NLL). The FW was significantly more likely to fail compared with the NLL (P = 0.0379). Specifically, the FW was 14.667 times likelier to fail than the NLL. When one and two strands of NLL were compared with FW, the FW was 6 times more likely to fail than one strand of NLL and 32 times more likely to fail than two strands of NLL. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study comparing the two materials used in the LFS procedure performed in clinical cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nylons</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyesters</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rupture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sutures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computed tomography (CT) revealed abnormal, bilateral ossification of the soft tissues extending from the region of the tympanic bullae to the medial aspect of the angular process of each mandible. Those ossified structures most closely approximated the location of the lateral pterygoid muscles. The ossified structures were present at presentation and initially manifested as complete ossification on the right side. The condition progressed to complete bilateral ossification by 3 yr of age. The mandibular condyles associated with the temporomandibular joints were malformed. The patient had severe mandibular distoclusion with deviation of the mandible to the left. The left mandibular cheek teeth were positioned in a caudal cross bite. A single treatment of manual stretching and breakdown of the ossified muscle of mastication by placement of tongue depressors within the oral cavity resulted in no increase in TMJ range of motion as measured by the incisal opening.

Records of 152 very underweight or emaciated dogs seized by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) Humane Law Enforcement (HLE) division were reviewed. Dogs were classified as emaciated if the admission body weight was estimated to be &#8805; 30% below the anticipated ideal body weight and classified as very underweight if the admission weight was estimated to be 20-29% below the anticipated ideal body weight. An initial minimum database was obtained on each animal, and when possible, clinicopathologic abnormalities were serially assessed. The most common initial abnormalities, present in &#8805; 25% of dogs, were hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, anemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated BUN/creatinine ratio, and hypocalcemia. Mean time to gain 20% of admission body weight was similar for the abnormalities studied. Although there was some evidence that dogs with anemia and/or hypoalbuminemia required more days to gain weight, future studies are required for confirmation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Urea Nitrogen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoalbuminemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Starvation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weight Gain</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The eggs were identified as Eucoleus boehmi (E. boehmi), the nasal capillarid, based on size and shell wall surface morphology. The dog had a history of chronic sneezing (&gt; 5 times/day) and intermittent postexercise nasal discharge. Currently, there are no anthelmintics approved for use in dogs for the treatment of E. boehmi. Treatment of the dog with 0.5-1 mg/kg milbemycin oxime was ineffective, but treatment with 2 mg/kg milbemycin oxime resulted in negative fecal examinations 7-28 days and 5 mo posttreatment. The dog's postexertion nasal discharge greatly lessened, and the sneezing behavior improved (it was only noted 2-3 times/wk), but neither the discharge nor sneezing completely resolved following the anthelmintic treatments. Use of milbemycin oxime at an increased dose (2 mg/kg) appeared to be an effective treatment against E. boehmi infection in this dog based on clinical response and the cessation of fecal egg shedding.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Capillaria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enoplida Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Macrolides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasite Egg Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Despite its common use, the long-term efficacy of the IG procedure has not been reported. The hypothesis of this study was that IG performed either during surgical treatment of GDV or as a prophylactic measure would effectively prevent GDV. Medical records of 61 dogs undergoing IG following either gastric derotation for treatment of GDV or as a prophylactic procedure were evaluated retrospectively. Median follow-up time for all dogs was 717 days (range, 49-2,511 days). Of the 61 dogs, 27 had prophylactic IG performed. The remaining 34 dogs presented for GDV and had an IG performed during surgical treatment of GDV. No dog experienced GDV after IG. Recurrence of gastric dilatation (GD) alone was noted in 3 of 34 patients (8.8%) undergoing IG during surgery for GDV and in 3 of 27 patients (11.1%) treated prophylactically with IG. This study confirmed the efficacy of IG for the long-term prevention of GDV in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastropexy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Volvulus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Other perioperative complications, such as a head tilt, nystagmus, incisional drainage, draining tracts, hearing loss, as well as bacterial culture results, were noted. Postoperative facial nerve paresis occurred in 36 of 133 ears (27.1%), and paralysis occurred in 29 of 133 ears (21.8%), with no significant difference between species. Thus, postoperative facial nerve deficits occurred in 48.9% of ears. The median duration of clinically evident temporary facial nerve deficits was 2 wk for dogs and 4 wk for cats. Dogs had a significantly longer duration of preoperative clinical signs and were less likely than cats to have a mass in the ear canal. Dogs were less likely to have residual (&gt; 1 yr) postoperative facial nerve deficits. The incidence of postoperative Horner's syndrome was significantly higher in cats than dogs. The duration of preoperative clinical signs of ear disease was not associated with postoperative facial nerve deficits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Facial Paralysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horner Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurologic Examination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At the time of presentation, 14 hr after the sting, the dog was hypotensive, comatose, seizuring, and had a brief period of cardiac arrest. Over the following 48 hr, the dog developed azotemia, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, hypertension, hematochezia, hematemesis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The dog's neurologic status improved slowly, but significant behavioral abnormalities remained. The dog was discharged after 7 days with ongoing polyuria, polydipsia, and behavioral changes. The polydipsia and polyuria resolved within a few days, but the behavioral changes continued for 6 wk. Reports of anaphylaxis from any cause are sparse in the veterinary literature. This is the first report of suspected anaphylaxis following a bee sting. There are no previous reports of behavioral changes after physical recovery from anaphylaxis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anaphylaxis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bee Venoms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insect Bites and Stings</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) revealed that the right distal femur had valgus, procurvatum, external rotation, and was 35% (70 mm) shorter than the contralateral femur. Distal femoral wedge ostectomies were performed to acutely correct the angular and rotational deformities. Lengthening of the femur was accomplished by distraction osteogenesis performed over 53 days at a second, proximal diaphyseal osteotomy using a circular fixator construct. This bifocal approach yielded approximately 30 mm of femoral lengthening and a confluent column of regenerate bone that bridged the distraction gap. When evaluated 14 mo after surgery, the dog held the right hip, stifle, and hock in a slightly extended posture when standing and had a subtle asymmetric hind limb gait. The stride of the right hind limb was slightly shortened with compensatory circumduction of the left hind limb during the swing phase of the stride.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>External Fixators</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Femur</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leg Length Inequality</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteogenesis, Distraction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rotation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The expression levels of the Pgp and p53 proteins were evaluated for their clinicopathologic significance among standard histologic evaluation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival samples of 31 previously untreated LSA cases to detect the expression of Pgp and p53. All dogs were subsequently treated with a combination chemotherapy protocol. Remission and survival durations were evaluated for correlation with histologic grade and presence of drug resistance markers. Of the 31 cases, 24 (80%) and 7 (22%) were positive for Pgp and p53, respectively. Overall, the median survival and duration of remission in the study was 246 days and 137 days, respectively. The National Cancer Institute working formulation histologic grade was not associated with either survival or duration of first remission (DOR). The Pgp protein expression and DOR and survival was not statistically significant.

Samples were classified as to either the presence or absence of major categories of pathologic processes, including malignant neoplasia, inflammation, hyperplasia/benign neoplasia, vacuolar change, extramedullary hematopoeisis, cholestasis, necrosis, and no microscopic abnormalities. Evaluation of selection bias was performed by review of the relative distribution of cytologic diagnoses for cases with histology compared with cases excluded from the comparison analysis because histology results were not available. Cytology had the highest sensitivity for vacuolar change (57.9%), followed by neoplasia (52.0%). Cytology had the highest positive predictive value (PPV) for neoplasia (86.7%) followed by vacuolar change (51.6%). Cytology had lower sensitivity and PPVs for inflammation, necrosis, and hyperplasia. The ability of cytology to characterize disease in canine FLL varies by pathologic process. Clinicians can have a high degree of confidence when a cytologic diagnosis of neoplasia is given; however, cytology is less reliable for excluding the potential for neoplasia. Cytology has a low sensitivity and PPV for inflammation and a limited diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of vacuolar change.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cytodiagnosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The goal of this study was to increase awareness of this disease by describing the clinical and laboratory findings in four young border collies with inherited cobalamin deficiency. The median age of the dogs was 11.5 mo (range, 8-42 mo), and two of the four dogs were full siblings. Clinical signs included intermittent lethargy (n = 4), poor body condition (n = 4), odynophagia (n = 2), glossitis (n = 1), and bradyarrhythmia (n = 1). Pertinent laboratory abnormalities were mild to moderate normocytic nonregenerative anemia (n = 3), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (n = 3), and mild proteinuria (n = 3). All of the dogs had serum cobalamin levels below the detection limit of the assay, marked methylmalonic aciduria, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Full clinical recovery was achieved in all dogs with regular parenteral cobalamin supplementation, and laboratory abnormalities resolved, except the proteinuria and elevated AST activity persisted. This case series demonstrates the diverse clinical picture of primary cobalamin deficiency in border collies. Young border collies presenting with ambiguous clinical signs should be screened for cobalamin deficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin B 12</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin B 12 Deficiency</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Six dogs were diagnosed with colonic torsion/volvulus during the study period. Four dogs had a history of previous gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV) with prophylactic gastropexy. Three of six dogs diagnosed with colonic torsion/volvulus had large intestinal entrapment and strangulation around the gastropexy site at the time of surgery. The history, clinical signs, physical examination, and radiologic findings were not specific for colonic torsion/volvulus in any dog. Early exploratory laparotomy was indicated to confirm the diagnosis and perform surgical correction of the affected bowel segments. Three of five dogs that underwent surgery had a left abdominal wall colopexy performed. All five dogs that underwent surgery in this study survived postoperatively. One patient was euthanized without surgical intervention. Results suggest that colonic torsion/volvulus should be considered in any large-breed dog with nonspecific gastrointestinal clinical signs and a history of previous gastropexy. Early recognition and prompt treatment of this condition may result in a good outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colonic Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Early Diagnosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Volvulus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Torsion Abnormality</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Nonetheless, pyrethroid intoxication has been reported in cats and dogs, and cats appear to be more susceptible due to difficulty in biotransformation and excretion of pyrethroids. Pyrethroid intoxications are generally due to either the improper use or accidental ingestion of approved products. Methocarbamol, given as intermittent injections, is a common first-line treatment choice for the tremors associated with pyrethroid intoxication. Two cats and one dog were treated with a methocarbamol continuous rate infusion (CRI) for pyrethroid intoxication. Clinical signs of toxicity resolved within a few hr in all three cases, with no adverse drug effects. A methocarbamol CRI can be considered in animals presenting with pyrethroid intoxication.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Overdose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insecticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methocarbamol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Muscle Relaxants, Central</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyrethrins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The assessment of patient history, chief complaint, physical exam findings, and indicated additional testing will determine the need for fluid therapy. Fluid selection is dictated by the patient's needs, including volume, rate, fluid composition required, and location the fluid is needed (e.g., interstitial versus intravascular). Therapy must be individualized, tailored to each patient, and constantly re-evaluated and reformulated according to changes in status. Needs may vary according to the existence of either acute or chronic conditions, patient pathology (e.g., acid-base, oncotic, electrolyte abnormalities), and comorbid conditions. All patients should be assessed for three types of fluid disturbances: changes in volume, changes in content, and/or changes in distribution. The goals of these guidelines are to assist the clinician in prioritizing goals, selecting appropriate fluids and rates of administration, and assessing patient response to therapy. These guidelines provide recommendations for fluid administration for anesthetized patients and patients with fluid disturbances.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluid Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemostasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Practice Patterns, Physicians'</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Water-Electrolyte Balance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Water-Electrolyte Imbalance</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Echocardiography revealed pericardial effusion, a nodule associated with the left ventricular papillary muscle, and a right atrial mural lesion. Therapy for myocardial performance and glaucoma was initiated. A combination of itraconazole and fluconazole successfully treated the dog. The dog regained vision in the left eye (oculus sinister [OS]) and had no residual cardiac disease detectable by either electrocardiography or echocardiography.

Radiographs showed a lateral longitudinal patellar fracture as well as a medial patellar luxation. Arthroscopic examination of the stifle and repair of the patellar fracture and luxation were performed with an excellent clinical outcome. Nine weeks postoperatively, the owners reported that the cat was using the leg normally inside, and re-examination revealed no pain or crepitus with manipulation of the limb.

Records were collected from dogs that underwent intestinal surgery from 1998 to 2007 at four veterinary teaching hospitals and one private referral clinic. Dogs were included if they were diagnosed with septic peritonitis and had subsequent surgery of either the small intestine or cecum. Eighty-two surgeries were evaluated. Eighteen dogs (22%) received a serosal patch during surgery. Of those, three dogs (16.7%) had septic peritonitis postoperatively. Sixty-four dogs (78%) did not receive a serosal patch, and 19 of those dogs (29.7%) had postoperative septic peritonitis (P = 0.27).

MRI of the brain was performed to investigate potential causes for the neurologic signs. MRI revealed bilaterally symmetrical hyperintensities within the caudate nuclei, globus pallidus, thalamus, deep cerebellar nuclei, and cortical gray matter on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, which coincided with areas of bilirubin deposition and neuronal necrosis (kernicterus) identified on necropsy examination. This is the second case report of an adult dog exhibiting kernicterus, and the first report to document MRI findings associated with that condition. Kernicterus is an uncommonly reported complication of hyperbilirubinemia in dogs, but is potentially underreported due to difficulties in recognizing subtle lesions and distinguishing kernicterus from other potential causes of neurologic abnormalities with readily available antemortem tests. MRI may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of kernicterus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperbilirubinemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kernicterus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe a case of peritoneal EMH effusion in a dog. A 5 yr old castrated male shorthaired dachshund presented with a 2 day history of pigmenturia and inappetence. A complete blood count revealed regenerative anemia with marked agglutination, spherocytosis, and an acute inflammatory leukogram characterized by a neutrophilia, regenerative left shift, and monocytosis. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of peritoneal effusion yielded a sample of high nucleated cellularity predominantly composed of mature and immature neutrophils and erythroid precursor cells.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether abdominal ultrasonography should be performed routinely at initial diagnosis of skeletal OSA or if certain abnormal physical examination or diagnostic findings would provide greater indication to perform ultrasonography. Eighty dogs with OSA that had an abdominal ultrasonogram performed at diagnosis were included. Abnormal findings were present in 36 of 80 dogs. Twenty-three abnormalities were evaluated with either fine-needle aspirate or biopsy and 19 were benign. None of the ultrasonograms revealed abdominal OSA metastases; however, 4 of the 80 ultrasonograms (5%) revealed another primary neoplasia. Further, 2 of the 9 cases that received an ultrasonogram due to a palpable abdominal mass were diagnosed with another primary neoplasia compared with only 1 of the 49 cases that received an ultrasonogram for routine staging. Abdominal ultrasonography as a part of staging is unlikely to reveal metastases from OSA and may not be a useful routine staging tool; however, in certain populations of dogs, such as those with palpable abdominal masses, abdominal ultrasonography may reveal abnormalities that may influence treatment decisions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdomen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records of dogs with leishmaniasis in clinical stage C (according to the Canine Leishmaniasis Working Group staging system) and either proteinuric or borderline proteinuric (according to the International Renal Interest Society [IRIS] staging system) were reviewed. All dogs were treated with meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol for 4-8 wk. After treatment, UP/C, total protein, and total globulin significantly decreased and albumin and the albumin/globulin ratio (A/G) increased. After treatment, 7 of the 53 dogs (13.4%) became nonproteinuric following either a proteinuric or borderline proteinuric stage. Moreover, 12 of the 53 proteinuric dogs (22.6%) changed their stage to borderline proteinuric. The antileishmaniasis treatment with meglumine antimoniate in combination with allopurinol in dogs significantly reduced the degree of proteinuria in a short period of time.

Neurologic examination was consistent with a lesion affecting the first through fifth cervical spinal cord segments. MRI disclosed bilaterally symmetric hyperintensities on T2-weighted (T2W) images in the crus cerebri and pyramidal tracts of the brain and the dorsal portion of the lateral funiculi of the cervical spinal cord. Fifty days after initial presentation, the dog was euthanized due to disease progression. Pathologic examination of the central nervous system (CNS) revealed a bilaterally symmetric chronic leukoencephalomyelopathy (LEM) consistent with previous reports of LEM in rottweilers. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe the MRI characteristics of LEM in the rottweiler. The topography of the changes observed with MRI paralleled the pathologic changes, which were widespread loss of myelin, decreased axon numbers, and astroglial proliferation. Consequently, MRI of the CNS of affected rottweilers may aid in establishing a presumptive antemortem diagnosis of LEM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ataxia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Euthanasia, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leukoencephalopathies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Paresis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The median radiation dose for the first course of RT was 24 Gray (Gy). All dogs clinically responded, and 11 had complete resolution of signs for a median of 114 days. Dogs were retreated at relapse, with a median dose of 20 Gy, and 26 of 37 dogs (70%) had clinical responses. The second course of RT was initiated at a median of 150 days following completion of the first course. Side effects were mild: four dogs had chronic ocular conditions necessitating medication, one of which required enucleation. Median survival time (ST) from the first dose of RT was 453 days and 180 days from the first dose of the second course of RT. The following factors were examined but were not significant for survival: total RT dose, dose of the first course of RT, complete resolution of clinical signs, use of either chemotherapy or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and stage (T1/T2 versus T3/T4). Dogs responded well to reirradiation with a subset experiencing chronic ocular side effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

One day prior to presentation, the patient was swimming at a local lake known to be contaminated with high levels of blue-green algae that was responsible for deaths of several other dogs the same summer. The patient presented 24 hr after exposure with vomiting, inappetence, weakness, and lethargy. Blood work at the time of admission was consistent with acute hepatic failure, characteristic findings of intoxication by Microcystis spp. Diagnosis was suspected by analyzing a water sample from the location where the patient was swimming. Supportive care including fluids, fresh frozen plasma, whole blood, vitamin K, B complex vitamins, S-adenosyl methionine, and Silybum marianum were started. The patient was discharged on supportive medications, and follow-up blood work showed continued improvement. Ingestion is typically fatal for most patients.

This prospective study enrolled 13 canine blood donors, each subjected to both gravity and suction collection methods, in a randomized order. Clinical parameters, including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rectal temperature (RT), were evaluated at four time points, including when the donor was on the floor and on the collection table, and before and after blood donation. The number of times the donor and needle required repositioning, the duration of the donation, the noise created by the apparatus, and the presence of a hematoma were evaluated. The weight, index of hemolysis, and hematocrit of each unit of blood were recorded. There was no significant difference between collection methods for either the clinical parameters at each time point or the prevalence of hematoma formation, the frequency of needle repositioning, the hemolysis index, or hematocrit. Collection by suction was noisier (P &lt; 0.0001), faster (P = 0.004), and associated with significantly less donor repositioning (P = 0.007). Suction appears to be a safe and cost-effective method that should be considered to optimize blood donation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Donors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Transfusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gravitation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The reported clinical signs included intense pain when opening the mouth and restricted jaw movement. MRI detected widespread, symmetrical, and inhomogeneously hyperintense areas in the masticatory muscle. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated severe and spontaneous pathologic activity in the temporal and masseter muscles. With early therapeutic treatment, remission of symptoms occurred within 2 mo, and no relapses were observed for the subsequent 2 yr. The gold standard for the diagnosis of MMM is the 2M antibody test, but the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of MRI as an accurate and efficient diagnostic tool for the initiation of early therapy for the treatment of muscle myositis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clindamycin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Early Diagnosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Masticatory Muscles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myositis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors compared the safety, hemostatic efficacy, and handling characteristics of a thrombin-containing topical surgical hemostatic agent (a gelatin matrix) to a hemostatic gelatin sponge for treatment of parenchymal bleeding after liver biopsy. Fourteen dogs were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Paired 1.5 cm &#215; 1.5 cm and 0.5 cm deep liver biopsies were obtained via laparotomy for each dog. One bleeding liver biopsy lesion was treated with the gelatin matrix and the other with a gelatin sponge. The treated liver biopsy sites were compared for bleeding severity, time to hemostasis, cumulative blood loss, and hemostatic agent handling characteristics. Median time to hemostasis was significantly shorter (P = 0.034) and median cumulative blood loss was significantly lower (P = 0.033) for the lesions treated with the gelatin matrix than the gelatin sponge. Adverse reactions were not observed within the first 24 hr postoperatively. When used to control parenchymal bleeding from liver biopsy sites in the dog, the evaluated gelatin matrix was safe and more effective than the gelatin sponge.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gelatin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemorrhage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemostatics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Low-field MRI allowed for adequate diagnosis of zygomatic gland disease in all cases and provided detailed information about both the specific tissue characteristics of each lesion and extension into surrounding structures. MRI findings were also helpful for surgical planning and dictated the choice of a modified lateral orbitotomy without removal of the orbital ligament.

Eight dogs were anesthetized three different times. They randomly received enrofloxacin, ampicillin Na/sulbactam Na, and saline. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BPs (SAP, DAP, and MAP, respectively), heart rate (HR), O2 saturation of hemoglobin, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) concentration, inspired isoflurane concentration, end-tidal isoflurane (ETiso) concentration, respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, and body temperature were measured for 20 min prior to administration of treatment, during administration over 30 min, and for 30 min after administration. There was no significant difference in the SAP or ETiso. There was no significant change in the arterial pressure values over time in the enrofloxacin and ampicillin Na/sulbactam Na groups. The control group's MAP increased over time and was increased compared with the enrofloxacin group at times 25, 35, 45, and 55. The statistical difference between the enrofloxacin and the control groups was due to an increase in the MAP in the control group, not a decrease in the enrofloxacin group's BP. Neither enrofloxacin nor ampicillin Na/sulbactam Na caused hypotension in healthy dogs anesthetized with isoflurane and fentanyl.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Ampicillin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibiotic Prophylaxis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enrofloxacin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluoroquinolones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoflurane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sulbactam</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Wound Infection</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records of seven dogs with naturally occurring retroperitoneal infections from 1999 to 2011 were reviewed to document historical, examination, clinicopathologic, imaging, and surgical findings; etiologic agents; and outcome. Middle-aged sporting dogs were most commonly affected. Dogs were febrile with evidence of either abdominal or lumbar pain. Although traditional radiography can aid in diagnosis, ultrasound appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of disease within the retroperitoneal space. Numerous bacteria were isolated from the abscesses, with anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria being the most commonly isolated. Etiology was largely unknown, but migrating plant material was often suspected. Resolution of the infection required surgical intervention as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy. Although recurrence is possible, outcome can be favorable with no long-term sequela.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria, Aerobic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria, Anaerobic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All cases had systemic hypertension, ranging from 180 mm Hg to 260 mm Hg. MRI of the brain disclosed noncontrast-enhancing, ill-defined, T2-weighted (T2W) hyperintensities in the white matter of the cerebrum in the areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Lesions were also observed in the caudate nuclei and thalamus (n = 1 in each). Intracranial hemorrhage was observed in one animal. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was consistent with vasogenic edema in two animals. Retinal lesions were observed in three animals. Hypertension was secondary to renal disease in three animals. A primary underlying disorder was not identified in one animal. Normalization of blood pressure was achieved with amlodipine either alone or in combination with enalapril. In one cat, hypertension spontaneously resolved. In three cases, neurologic improvement occurred within 24-48 hr of normalization of blood pressure. The presumptive diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy was supported by the MRI findings and neurologic dysfunction coincident with systemic hypertension in which the neurologic dysfunction improved with treatment of hypertension. The prognosis appears good for the resolution of neurologic deficits with normalization of blood pressure in animals with hypertensive encephalopathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertensive Encephalopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The authors evaluated the use of single-agent doxorubicin in an intermittent fashion for efficacy in the treatment of this disease. Morphologic and clinical data were analyzed for prognostic significance. Eighteen dogs with B-cell lymphoma, all with multicentric disease, were enrolled. The overall complete response (CR) rate was 78%, median total doxorubicin remission time (TDR) was 80.5 days, and median overall survival (OS) was 169.5 days. The median number of doxorubicin doses administered was 4.5. First remission times were significantly affected by clinical stage and substage of disease. Outcome for the dogs in this study were similar to those previously reported for single-agent doxorubicin treatment. Additionally, the intermittent nature of the treatments made the described protocol more feasible for the owners who enrolled their pets in this study. Intermittent single-agent doxorubicin is not a substitute for multiagent chemotherapy protocols in the treatment of canine lymphoma; however, it is a reasonable alternative if the cost and time commitments are limiting factors for an owner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibiotics, Antineoplastic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Administration Schedule</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma, B-Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Remission Induction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical stage has been considered a negative prognostic factor for survival. The study authors hypothesized that the median survival time (MST) of dogs with metastatic (stage III) HSA treated with a vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) chemotherapy protocol would not be different than those with stage I/II HSA. Sixty-seven dogs with HSA in different anatomic locations were evaluated retrospectively. All dogs received the VAC protocol as an adjuvant to surgery (n = 50), neoadjuvant (n = 3), or as the sole treatment modality (n = 14). There was no significant difference (P = 0.97) between the MST of dogs with stage III and stage I/II HSA. For dogs presenting with splenic HSA alone, there was no significant difference between the MST of dogs with stage III and stage I/II disease (P = 0.12). The overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) was 86%). No unacceptable toxicities were observed. Dogs with stage III HSA treated with the VAC protocol have a similar prognosis to dogs with stage I/II HSA.

MRI findings are available for only one of those cases. Herein the authors present an 11 yr old English springer spaniel diagnosed with pituitary metastasis of pancreatic origin with a 24 hr history of blindness and only a single lesion on MRI. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations localized the lesion to the optic nerves, optic tracts, or optic chiasm. MRI showed a single lesion characterized by a well-circumscribed pituitary mass with extrasellar extension, causing compression of the optic chiasm. Signal intensity was unusual as enhancement could not be appreciated after contrast administration. The dog was euthanized without further diagnostic tests. Histopathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated exocrine pancreatic carcinoma with widespread metastasis involving the pituitary gland. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such case reported in a dog. Pituitary metastases should be included as a differential diagnosis for dogs presenting with acute-onset blindness and for single brain masses affecting the pituitary gland.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blindness</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pituitary Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MRI revealed paraspinal and epidural abscesses at the 13th thoracic (T13) and first lumbar (L1) disc space. The dog's condition worsened despite medical management, necessitating surgical decompression. Surgical decompression resulted in rapid improvement of the patient's clinical signs. Histopathologic evaluation of the lesions revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation. Cultures of fluid and tissue within the lesions were negative for bacterial growth, and no infectious organisms were visualized histologically. Melarsomine-associated neurologic signs can be chronic and progressive in nature, presumably secondary to ongoing sterile inflammation that may result in spinal cord compression.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arsenicals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Decompression, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epidural Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intramuscular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Compression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracic Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triazines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Sixteen cats with stage I and II gastric lymphoma treated with chemotherapy were included in this study. Seventy-five percent of cats experienced remission. Overall, first remission duration was 108 days. Response to treatment was prognostic as in other types of feline lymphoma. Cats with a complete remission (CR) had longer survival times compared with cats with a partial remission (PR). Sex and treatment with a rescue protocol were found to be prognostic with castrated males having longer survivals than spayed females. Cats that received rescue chemotherapy had shorter first remission durations than those that did not. Prior treatment with steroids and stage were not found to be significant prognostic variables. This study characterizes gastric lymphoma treated with chemotherapy in cats. Further studies are needed to determine the comparative efficacy of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments for feline gastric lymphoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinicopathologic abnormalities were suggestive of a discospondylitis at the seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae. Blood and urine cultures yielded growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) that was resistant to all commonly used antibiotics. Extralabel antibiotic susceptibility testing demonstrated susceptibility of both blood and urine isolates to linezolid. The prescribed dose was extrapolated from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and the isolate's plasma minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

A presumptive diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis was made based on clinical signs, urinalysis, and cytologic analysis of a traumatic catheterization sample. Carboplatin was removed from the chemotherapy treatment plan and was substituted with doxorubicin. The dog was treated with meloxicam for pain, and the cystitis signs subsided over a period of 4 wk.

Suramin is a polysulfonated napthylurea, which at noncytotoxic concentrations in vitro, increases tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, including doxorubicin. The study authors evaluated the combination of noncytotoxic suramin and doxorubicin after amputation in dogs with OSA. The hypothesis was that treatment of dogs with appendicular OSA with amputation, adjuvant doxorubicin, and noncytotoxic suramin would be well tolerated and result in STs at least comparable to those of doxorubicin alone. Forty-seven dogs received 6.75 mg/kg of suramin IV followed by 30 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin IV 4 hr later. Treatment was repeated q 2 wk for five doses. The median disease free time (DFI) was 203 days (range, 42-1,580+ days) and the median ST for all dogs was 369 days (range, 92-1,616+ days). There was no statistical difference in ST and DFI between greyhounds and nonngreyhounds. Adjuvant doxorubicin and noncytotoxic suramin was well tolerated in dogs with OSA following amputation. Additional studies are needed to determine if this combination treatment protocol provides additional clinical benefit compared with doxorubicin alone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amputation, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chemotherapy, Adjuvant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suramin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Unfortunately, thiopental is no longer manufactured. In its absence, the ideal anesthetic protocol for laryngoscopy has not been determined. Propofol and propofol/ketamine were compared for the evaluation of laryngeal function in 48 healthy dogs. Laryngeal exposure was moderate to excellent in all dogs and not significantly different between protocols. Saturation of peripheral O2 (SPO2) readings were decreased in the propofol/ketamine group, and deeper respirations were more likely to correlate with normal laryngeal function regardless of treatment group. Doxapram was administered to apneic patients to stimulate respiration and allow for evaluation of laryngeal function. No significant difference in frequency of doxapram administration between groups was noted. Doxapram resulted in higher respiratory scores and significantly increased the ability to determine normal laryngeal function. Ketamine did not allow for a reduction in propofol dose and caused increased respiratory depression, making ketamine a poor addition to propofol for laryngeal function examination. Regardless of the protocol used, laryngeal function should be determined in conjunction with the respiratory phase and depth of respirations. Patients with either absent or shallow respirations should receive doxapram for accurate evaluation of laryngeal function.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthetics, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ketamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Larynx</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Propofol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this prospective, randomized, open-label clinical study was to compare the cardiovascular effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane via direct arterial blood pressure measurements and the lithium dilution cardiac output (LDCO) on premedicated healthy dogs undergoing elective tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO). Nineteen client-owned dogs were included. All dogs were premedicated with hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg IV and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously). Ten dogs were anesthetized with sevoflurane and nine dogs were anesthetized with isoflurane. Eighteen dogs were instrumented with a dorsal pedal arterial catheter, and one dog had a femoral arterial catheter. All dogs had continuous, direct systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean arterial (MAP) blood pressure readings as well as heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), stroke volume variation (SVV), and pulse pressure variation (PPV) recorded q 5 min during the surgical procedure. There was no significant statistical difference in all parameters between the sevoflurane and isoflurane treatment groups.

Due to difficulties administering oral medications, veterinarians sometimes prescribe compounded transdermal cyclosporine, despite studies showing limited absorption. The study objective was to compare cyclosporine blood concentrations after oral administration to concentrations after transdermal application of cyclosporine (prepared in pluronic lecithin organogel [PLO]) in six cats using a controlled, cross-over design with a 2 wk washout period. Cats were dosed at 5.1-7.4 mg/kg of cyclosporine q 24 hr either per os for 7 days or transdermally for 21 days. Cyclosporine blood concentrations were measured q 7 days and after the washout period. A monoclonal-based immunoassay (lower limit of quantitation was 25 ng/mL) was used. Median concentrations on the seventh day were 2,208 ng/mL (range, 1,357-3,419 ng/mL) 2 hr after orally administered cyclosporine and 37 ng/mL (range, 25-290 ng/mL) 2 hr after transdermally applied cyclosporine. Median concentration on day 21 was 58 ng/mL (range, 51-878 ng/mL) 2 hr after transdermally applied cyclosporine. Concentrations were quantifiable for transdermally applied cyclosporine, but considered therapeutic in only one of six cats. Based on those results, transdermally applied cyclosporine was not recommended in cats because of inconsistent absorption.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Cutaneous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Because interobserver variability may lead to inaccurate estimations of nodule growth on repeat radiographic assessment, an incorrect presumption of malignant etiology or misclassification of tumor response to treatment may result. The maximum diameters of 47 pulmonary nodules from 22 dogs and 7 cats were measured. Measurements were performed using one digital thoracic radiographic projection by eight clinicians. The eight clinicians included two interns, two residents, two board-certified veterinary specialists, and two board-certified veterinary radiologists. A mixed-effect analysis of variance model was used to evaluate the contribution of reader, experience level, patient, nodule, and nodule size to the overall variability in mean pulmonary nodule diameter. The interobserver variability in diameter measurement for any given nodule was 16%, and experience level and nodule size classification did not contribute to measurement variability. Linear measurements of the diameter of a pulmonary nodule can vary significantly among a group of clinicians; however, depending on the criteria used to evaluate nodule growth or tumor response, the 16% interobserver variability reported here is likely not clinically significant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Observer Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Thoracic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Solitary Pulmonary Nodule</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records for 19 dogs with nonlymphomatous nasal tumors treated with hypofractionated image-guided robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), either with or without adjunctive treatment, were retrospectively analyzed for survival and prognostic factors. Median survival time (MST) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Age, breed, tumor type, stage, tumor size, prescribed radiation dose, and heterogeneity index were analyzed for prognostic significance. Dogs were treated with three consecutive-day, 8-12 gray (Gy) fractions of image-guided robotic SBRT. Overall MST was 399 days. No significant prognostic factors were identified. Acute side effects were rare and mild. Late side effects included one dog with an oronasal fistula and six dogs with seizures. In three of six dogs, seizures were a presenting complaint prior to SBRT. The cause of seizures in the remaining three dogs could not be definitively determined due to lack of follow-up computed tomography (CT) imaging. The seizures could have been related to either progression of disease or late radiation effect. Results indicate that image-guided robotic SBRT, either with or without adjunctive therapy, for canine nonlymphomatous nasal tumors provides comparable survival times (STs) to daily fractionated megavoltage radiation with fewer required fractions and fewer acute side effects.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose Fractionation, Radiation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphatic Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiotherapy, Image-Guided</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Lysis of the proximal one-third of the os penis was diagnosed on abdominal radiographs, and a positive contrast urethrography revealed a smoothly marginated filling defect along the dorsal aspect of the urethra at the level of the radiographically observed osteolysis. Regional ultrasound revealed an echogenic mass at the proximal aspect of the os penis with a severely irregular and discontinuous periosteal surface. A penile hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was confirmed on histopathologic evaluation after a penile amputation and scrotal urethrostomy were performed. Although HSA is a common malignant neoplasm in dogs, lysis of the os penis has not previously been documented. Adjunctive chemotherapy, although recommended, was declined, and the patient survived 236 days postoperatively. That survival time is considerably longer than the average survival time for patients with HSA, other than cutaneous forms of HSA. Although an uncommon presentation, HSA of the penis should be considered a differential diagnosis in older canines with signs of lower urinary tract disease, especially in breeds that have been documented to be predisposed to HSA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Penile Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Stricture</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiographs of client-owned animals with historical evidence of extraction of teeth 309 and 409 were reviewed. All patients had dental extraction(s) for clinical reasons, and all extractions were deemed successful by the practitioners. Extraction sites were radiographed to identify tooth root fragments and pathology. Twenty-five canine and 25 feline patients that had extractions utilizing preoperative and postoperative radiography were also included. Sixty-one of 74 canine patients (82.4%; P &lt; 0.0001) and 39 of 42 feline patients (92.8%; P &lt; 0.0001) had evidence of retained tooth root fragments. In total, 100 of 116 cases (86.4%; P &lt; 0.0001) had retained tooth root fragments, and periapical pathology was found in 66 of 116 (56.8%; P = 0.000000743) radiographs, including 39 of 74 canine cases (52.7%; P = 0.00002765) and 27 of 42 feline cases (64.3%; P = 0.01589). The control group had no evidence of retained root fragments.

Information for 52 dogs, 28 dogs, and 23 dogs was available for analysis of survival to discharge, postdischarge survival, and long-term outcome, respectively. Ninety-two percent of dogs survived to the time of discharge and 18% of dogs surviving to discharge were euthanized within 2 mo of surgery. Breed, age at the time of presentation, and gender were not correlated with increased odds of death prior to discharge from the hospital. Long-term outcome for dogs was excellent in 30%, good in 57%, and poor in 13% of dogs. Although this study shows a relatively high mortality rate prior to discharge from the hospital and within 2 mo of surgical treatment, the long-term outcome is good or excellent in 87% of survivors.

Initial laboratory evaluation revealed a hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with alkaline urine that was consistent with a diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Targeted therapy was initiated with Na bicarbonate (HCO3) and potassium (K) gluconate. Leptospirosis was subsequently diagnosed with paired microagglutination testing (MAT), and doxycycline was added to the other treatments. Clinical signs resolved, and 6 mo after diagnosis, although the dog remained on alkali therapy (i.e., NaHCO3 and K gluconate) and a mild metabolic acidosis persisted, the dog remained otherwise healthy with a good quality of life. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe the concomitant association of those two disorders.

In both cases, the surgical procedure and anesthetic recovery were uncomplicated and routine. Following surgery, both patients appeared bright, alert, responsive, and previous signs of regurgitation had resolved. Dyspnea and tachypnea developed 1-2 days postoperatively in each patient, and chylous effusion was detected on thoracocentesis. For each case, a diagnosis of chylothorax was based on cytology and triglyceride concentrations of the aspirated pleural fluid. Similar protocols for monitoring were used in the treatment of each patient's chylothorax. The duration and volume of chylous effusion production were closely monitored via routine thoracostomy tube aspiration. Both dogs rapidly progressed to recovery with no additional complications.

A parotid salivary mucocele was diagnosed via physical examination, fine-needle aspirate, and sialography of the parotid and mandibular salivary glands. Surgical excision of the right parotid salivary gland and duct was performed along with drainage of the mucocele. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications occurred, and follow-up examination 4 mo later revealed no evidence of recurrence. Case outcome was considered excellent. Sialography was useful for confirming the parotid gland as the source of the mucocele.

Numerous hematologic, radiographic, and endocrine diagnostic tests were performed with no identifiable underlying cause. Many risk factors have been identified for gastric dilatation and most were present in this Great Dane. A number of symptomatic treatments, aimed primarily at altering the gastrointestinal tract flora and motility were tried, but failed to influence the clinical course of the disease. The dog continued to worsen, experienced more frequent episodes of gastric dilatation, and developed generalized muscle atrophy. Biopsies were collected from the biceps femoris and triceps brachii muscles. A pattern of denervation atrophy was evident in both muscles, consistent with polyneuropathy. The owners elected humane euthanasia and a necropsy was performed. A striking finding at necropsy was severe loss of myelinated fibers with extensive endoneurial fibrosis in the vagus nerve, consistent with an autonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy is a previously unexplored cause of gastric dilatation and intestinal dysmotility in dogs. These findings should open new directions for exploring pathogenic mechanisms for gastric dilatation in this species.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Motility Disorders</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyneuropathies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between patient body weight and CsA dosing. Seventy-seven cases of canine atopic dermatitis managed between 2000 and 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. Duration of CsA therapy was at least 16 wk. Groups analyzed included the study population as a whole, those treated with only CsA, and those treated with both CsA and metoclopramide. The division between small and large dogs was set at 15 kg. Descriptive analysis, two-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlations, and a Student t test were used to analyze data. There were no significant differences between CsA dose and body weight regardless of method of analysis. Concurrent corticosteroid use, other medication use, and pruritus score were also analyzed over the study period. There was a significant decrease in CsA dose, corticosteroid dose, medication score, and pruritus score between the time points for all patients, but no significant relationship between those changes and body weight. These study findings suggest that differential CsA dosing is not warranted based on body weight.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Weight</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis, Atopic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Administration Schedule</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study was designed to determine if limited fluid volume resuscitation (LFVR) with hypertonic saline (HS) and hyperoncotic fluids (hydroxyethylstarch [HES]) results in more rapid cardiovascular stabilization in dogs with spontaneous hemoperitoneum versus conventional resuscitation (CR) with large volume resuscitation. Eighteen client-owned dogs presenting in hemorrhagic shock with a spontaneous hemoperitoneum were enrolled. Dogs were randomized to be fluid resuscitated with up to 90 mL/kg of an isotonic crystalloid (CR group) or up to 8 mL/kg of 7.2% Na chloride (i.e., HS) combined with up to 10 mL/kg of 6% HES. Measurements of vital signs, lactate, packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), and blood pressure were made at standard time points. The primary end point was time to stabilization of hemodynamic parameters (measured in min). Dogs in the LFVR group achieved hemodynamic stabilization significantly faster (20 min; range, 10-25 min) than those in the CR group (35 min; range, 15-50 min; P = .027). Future studies are warranted to further investigate potential benefits associated with LFVR in dogs with spontaneous hemoperitoneum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluid Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemoperitoneum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Resuscitation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Saline Solution, Hypertonic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Shock, Hemorrhagic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

CCNU was administered per os (PO) at a targeted dosage of 60 mg/m(2) body surface area on day 0, CTX was administered PO at a targeted dosage of 250 mg/m(2) divided over days 0 through 4, and all dogs received prophylactic antibiotics. Ninety treatments were given to the 57 dogs included in the study. Neutropenia was the principal toxic effect, and the overall frequency of grade 4 neutropenia after the first treatment of CCNU/CTX was 30% (95% confidence interval, 19-43%). The mean body weight of dogs with grade 4 neutropenia (19.7 kg &#177; 13.4 kg) was significantly less than the mean body weight of dogs that did not develop grade 4 neutropenia (31.7 kg &#177; 12.4 kg; P = .005). One dog (3%) developed hematologic changes suggestive of hepatotoxicity. No dogs had evidence of either renal toxicity or hemorrhagic cystitis. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were uncommon. On the basis of the findings reported herein, a dose of 60 mg/m(2) of CCNU combined with 250 mg/m(2) of CTX (divided over 5 days) q 4 wk is tolerable in tumor-bearing dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Administration Schedule</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lomustine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In total, 82 brachycephalic dogs (42 pugs and 40 French bulldogs) were evaluated by rhinoscopy for their intranasal mucosal contact and 25 normocephalic dogs were evaluated as a control group. Of those, 162 brachycephalic nasal cavities were evaluable and 140 had contact between intranasal structures (87%). Intraconchal and septoconchal mucosal contact points were the most commonly detected sites of contact. French bulldogs had a significantly higher prevalence of mucosal contact and had 3 mean contact points compared with 1.7 mean contact points per nasal cavity in pugs. Septal deviations were present in 62% of brachycephalic dogs. In the control group, mucosal contact points were present in only 7 of 50 nasal cavities (14%), and septal deviations occurred in 16% of those cases. Contact point average was 0.1 in large and 0.3 in small normocephalic dogs. Intranasal mucosal contact was identified as a common and previously unreported problem in brachycephalic dogs. Numerous contact points reduce the lumen of the intranasal passageways and indicate potential intranasal obstruction.

Neurologic deficits included a short-strided choppy gait in the thoracic limbs and a long-strided proprioceptive ataxia in the pelvic limbs. Withdrawal reflexes were decreased bilaterally in the thoracic limbs. Signs were consistent with a myelopathy of the caudal cervical/cranial thoracic spinal cord (i.e., the sixth cervical [C] vertebra to the second thoracic [T] vertebra). A mass associated with the C6-C7 articular facet on the left side was identified on MRI of the cervical spinal cord. The lesion was hyperintense to spinal cord parenchyma on T2-weighted images, hypointense on T1-weighted images, and there was strong homogenous contrast enhancement. Significant spinal cord compression was associated with the lesion. The mass was removed through a C6-C7 dorsal laminectomy and facetectomy. Histopathology of the mass was consistent with a synovial myxoma of the articular facet. A postoperative MRI showed complete surgical resection.

It has been suggested that MCT in certain locations may behave in a more biologically aggressive fashion than MCTs located in others; however, no published data are available for MCTs of canine pinnae treated with surgical excision. A retrospective study of 28 animals with surgical excision of MCTs of pinnae was completed with a medical record review and follow-up questionnaire to the operating veterinarian. The effect of tumor grade, clean or dirty excision, cartilage penetration, and mitotic index (MI) on local recurrence and survival time (ST) was evaluated. There was local recurrence in one dog with a grade 2 MCT and in seven of eight dogs with grade 3 MCTs. The median ST of animals with grade 1 and 2 MCTs was not reached, whereas the median ST of animals with grade 3 MCTs was 10 mo. There was no statistical association between histologically clean and dirty margins and either local recurrence or ST. A prolonged disease free interval without local recurrence may be achieved with local excision of grade 1 and 2 MCTs. Animals with grade 3 MCTs had a uniformly poor outcome with short times to local recurrence and death.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease-Free Survival</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear Auricle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mast-Cell Sarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Staging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thirty-five client-owned dogs that underwent intestinal resection and anastomosis were prospectively enrolled in the study. Abdominal fluid was submitted for culture at surgery and again 24 hr postoperatively. Twenty-four and 48 hr postoperatively, blood and abdominal fluid glucose and lactate were measured and fluid was submitted for cytology. Abdominal fluid was collected either from a closed-suction drain or by abdominocentesis. Patients were followed either for 14 days or until death. Comparisons were made based on development of dehiscence and presence or absence of a drain. Patients with dehiscence were more likely to have positive cultures at 24 hr and to have had more bowel resected. Surviving patients without drains had significantly smaller differences in blood and fluid glucose and lactate both 24 and 48 hr postoperatively than surviving patients with drains. The significant differences identified between patients with and without drains suggests a need for further research into the effect of drains on abdominal fluid values.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascitic Fluid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Wound Dehiscence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MRI of the brain demonstrated abnormalities consistent with severe meningitis and subdural empyema secondary to a retrobulbar abscess. The dog's clinical signs improved with antibiotic therapy, and repeat imaging showed resolution of subdural fluid accumulation presumed to be empyema with mild residual meningeal enhancement. Subdural empyema is an infrequent cause of encephalopathy in small animals and usually develops through direct extension of a pericranial infection. This report presents a case of presumptive subdural empyema in a dog that was successfully treated without surgical intervention. MRI is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of subdural empyema, and the characteristic imaging features are described.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Empyema, Subdural</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningitis, Bacterial</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Descriptive analysis of results was performed, &#967;(2) tests were used to detect differences in responses between dog and cat owners, and correlations were assessed using the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation. A total of 834 owners participated in the survey. More diabetic dogs (97%) than cats (82%) were treated with insulin injections. Insulin was administered twice daily in 87% of dogs and 73% of cats. Porcine lente and neutral protamine Hagedorn were the most commonly administered insulins in dogs. In cats, glargine and protamine zinc insulin were the most commonly used insulins. Most pets were not fed a prescribed diabetes diet. More cat (66%) than dog (50%) owners were satisfied with the diabetic control achieved. Cat owners were more likely to use home blood glucose monitoring. Treatment was considered expensive by the majority of owners. Few published reports follow diabetic pets after diagnosis or report owner satisfaction. The results of this study provide useful information that may help veterinarians better educate owners and set expectations regarding diabetes treatment and quality of life for diabetic pets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoglycemic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Patient Satisfaction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objectives of this study were to explore veterinarians' personal use of Facebook, knowledge of privacy settings, and factors related to sharing personal information online. All American Animal Hospital Association member veterinarians with a valid e-mail address (9469) were invited to complete an online survey about Facebook (e.g., time spent on Facebook, awareness of consequences, types of information posted). Questions assessing personality dimensions including trust, popularity, self-esteem and professional identity were included. The response rate was 17% (1594 of 9469); 72% of respondents (1148 of 1594) had a personal Facebook profile. Veterinarians were more likely to share information on Facebook than they would in general. Trust, need for popularity, and more time spent on Facebook predicted more disclosure of personal information on Facebook. Awareness of consequences and increased veterinary experience predicted lesser disclosure. As veterinary practices use Facebook to improve client services, they need also to manage risks associated with online disclosure by staff. Raising awareness of reputation management and consequences of posting certain types of information to Facebook is integral to protecting the individual, the practice, and the veterinary profession.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Professional Role</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Social Networking</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Societies, Medical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eighty brachycephalic dogs (41 pugs, 39 French bulldogs [FBs]) that underwent LATE because of obstructing conchae were evaluated by endoscopy 7 days and 6 mo after surgery. At 6 mo, 96% of FBs' and 65% of pugs' nasal cavities showed regrowth of turbinates. FBs showed higher growth grades than pugs. Revision surgery because of reobstructing regrowth was required in the nasal cavities of 17% of FBs and 3% of pugs. The mean number of contact points reduced from 3.0 in FB and 1.7 in pugs before surgery to 1.2 in FB and 0.2 in pugs after conchal regrowth. Recollapse of nares after surgery significantly influenced the frequency of reoccurrence of contact points. LATE was proven to be an effective treatment of intranasal obstruction caused by mucosal contact between conchae. Conchal regrowth commonly occurs after surgical removal, but the new conchae cause less obstruction due to a significant reduction in number of contact points. Revision surgery because of reobstruction is rarely necessary. The important physiologic functions of conchae make nonobstructing regrowth desirable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Constriction, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Craniosynostoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laser Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Mucosa</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turbinates</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This report describes computed tomographic (CT) findings in two dogs with BPFs and subsequent continuous pneumothoraces that necessitated thoracotomy. Both dogs had a peripheral BPF in the right caudal lung lobe. The fistula in one dog was secondary to a previous foreign body migration, and the fistula in the other was thought to be secondary to dirofilariasis. On both CT examinations, a dilated subsegmental bronchus was seen communicating with the pleural space at the center of a focal, concave region of parenchymal consolidation. Multiplanar reformatting aided in identification and characterization of the BPF. The pneumothoraces resolved after right caudal lobectomy in both dogs. CT has the potential to identify BPFs, such as secondary to foreign body migration or dirofilariasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchial Fistula</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pleural Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumothorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Thoracic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Tract Fistula</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records of all dogs having either UAL or VCC between 2000 and 2011 were analyzed. Twenty-five dogs had VCC and 20 dogs had UAL. The overall postoperative complications rates for VCC and UAL were similar (52% and 60%, respectively; P = .0887). Dogs that had UAL were more likely to have acute postoperative respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia (P = .0526). Dogs with VCC were more likely to have chronic postoperative respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia (P = .0079). Revision surgery was required in 6 dogs (24%) following VCC and 2 dogs (10%) following UAL. Sex, breed, presenting complaint, type of service provided, and concurrent diseases were not significantly associated with higher risk of either death or decreased survival time postoperatively with either procedure. Overall postoperative complication rates, required revision surgeries, and episodes of aspiration pneumonia were similar in dogs undergoing UAL and VCC surgeries. Dogs that had VCC appeared to have an increased risk of lifelong complications postoperatively compared with UAL; therefore, VCC may not be the optimal choice for treatment of laryngeal paralysis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arytenoid Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laryngectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vocal Cord Paralysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Diagnostic imaging modalities used to identify polyps included abdominal ultrasound, excretory urography, double-contrast retrograde urethrocystograms, and urethrocystoscopy, which revealed multiple filling defects within the proximal and prostatic urethra. Multiple cystotomies and endourologic procedures were performed to remove the multiple fibroepithelial polyps within the proximal and prostatic urethra. Urinary incontinence resulted from treatments, but did respond to phenylpropanolamine. Medical treatment consisted of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which appeared to decrease the recurrence of the polyps over time. Urethral polyps are an uncommon cause of urinary outflow obstruction and do not usually recur after removal. This case illustrates an uncommon clinical presentation and the difficulties encountered in treatment over an expanded time frame.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Combined Modality Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms, Fibroepithelial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyps</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recurrence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urologic Surgical Procedures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiography revealed a soft-tissue opacity between the urinary bladder and colon in six of seven dogs with uterine body and/or cervical tumors, and a soft-tissue opacity in the midventral abdomen in two dogs with uterine horn tumors. Ultrasonography revealed masses in all dogs with uterine body/cervical tumors and could delineate the origin of the mass in one of two dogs with uterine horn tumors. The mass was characterized ultrasonographically as solid in three dogs (all leiomyomas), solid with cystic component in four dogs (two adenocarcinomas, one leiomyoma, and one fibroleiomyoma), and cystic in two (both leiomyomas). Hyperechoic foci in the mass were observed in three dogs. Ultrasonography was a useful method for demonstrating uterine body and/or cervical tumors. However, it was not possible to ascertain sonographically that a mass originated in a uterine horn unless there was associated evidence of uterine horn to which the mass could be traced. The ultrasonographic appearance of uterine tumors was variable, and the type of neoplasm could only be determined by taking biopsies of the mass.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leiomyoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Predictive Value of Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterine Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a portable clinical analyzer for measurement of pH, partial pressure of CO2, Na, chloride, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, hematocrit, and hemoglobin in healthy and diseased rabbits. Blood samples obtained from 30 pet rabbits were analyzed immediately after collection by the portable clinical analyzer (PCA) and immediately thereafter (time &lt;20 sec) by a reference analyzer. Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression analysis were used to compare the results. Limits of agreement were wide for all the variables studied, with the exception of pH. Most variables presented significant proportional and/or constant bias. The current study provides sufficient evidence that the PCA presents reliability for pH, although its low agreement with a reference analyzer for the other variables does not support their interchangeability. Limits of agreement provided for each variable allow researchers to evaluate if the PCA is reliable enough for their scope. To the authors' knowledge, the present is the first report evaluating a PCA in the rabbit.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Chemical Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Gas Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrolytes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematocrit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemoglobins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Point-of-Care Systems</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Values</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At the time of admission, the dog had marked anemia and thrombocytosis, a decreased serum iron concentration, and a normal coagulation profile. An ultrasound examination showed a massive fluid-filled cavitated structure in the abdominal cavity. Paracentesis of that structure yielded a large amount of hemorrhagic fluid with an iron concentration &gt;24 times greater than the serum iron concentration, consistent with chronic sequestration of iron, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. Blood transfusions and incomplete surgical removal of the structure allowed short-term stabilization of the patient, but the dog was euthanized 17 days postsurgery for lethargy and continued abdominal distention. Histopathological evaluation of the structure was consistent with a chronic expanding hematoma. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of intra-abdominal chronic expanding hematoma in a dog.

It usually requires sending urine samples to a distant laboratory, which is costly and time consuming. A point-of-care urine dipstick that could accurately measure UPC would increase test utility and utilization. The objective of this study was to determine if there was good correlation and agreement between UPC as measured by a dipstick and a laboratory analyzer. Thirty-one canines undergoing UPC measurement as part of a diagnostic workup were included in the study. A total of 2 mL of urine was collected via cystocentesis. Urine was applied to the dipstick then presented to two blinded reviewers to analyze. The remaining urine was submitted to a clinical pathology laboratory for analysis. UPC data from the dipsticks and the analyzer was converted into an ordinal scale. Correlation and agreement between the individual reviews and the analyzer was calculated. Agreement between reviewers was substantial; however, correlation and agreement between the individual reviews and the analyzer was low. On the basis of this information, use of this veterinary urinary dipstick to determine UPC cannot be recommended at this time.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Point-of-Care Systems</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteinuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reagent Strips</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinalysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this study was to determine if there are soy, pork, and beef antigens in flavored OTC products and medications and, if so, could those antigens be identified. Seven products, three OTC products and four veterinary therapeutics, were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the presence of soy, pork, and beef antigens, in addition to positive and negative controls. All OTC test products produced ELISA results in agreement with their ingredient lists. ELISA testing of veterinary therapeutic products did not agree with either their ingredient lists or product inserts because of other ingredients not listed. Veterinarians should contact manufacturers of oral therapeutics prior to prescribing them to determine other ingredients. Likewise, manufacturers should be contacted regarding "natural and artificial flavors." Lastly, gelatin capsules may contain either beef or pork proteins and should not be administered during a trial. In conclusion, flavored medications contain the common antigens soy, pork, and beef although they may or may not be listed on the ingredient list or product insert.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antigens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clinical Trials as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Compounding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meat</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nonprescription Drugs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soybean Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Drugs</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination revealed marked dehydration, lethargy, and a grade 5/6 to-and-fro heart murmur that was auscultated best at the right sternal border. The dog was febrile, and echocardiography revealed a large, mobile, vegetative lesion in the right ventricular outflow tract associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Mild aortic insufficiency was present. Corynebacterium mustelae (C. mustelae) was isolated from a pooled blood culture. Treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) was initiated along with supportive care, and the patient was discharged 9 days later. The dog remained without clinical signs 132 days after discharge. VSD is rarely mentioned as a predisposing factor for development of IE in veterinary literature; however, this report highlights that dogs with a VSD may be at risk for IE. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of a canine infection with C. mustelae.

Physical examination showed marked obesity and facial swelling with a "tragic facial expression." Neurologic evaluation revealed the dog had multiple cranial nerve deficits and lower motor neuron signs in the pelvic limbs. Serum biochemical analysis and thyroid function tests were consistent with hypothyroidism. A biopsy from the common peroneal nerve revealed a loss of myelinated fibers, inappropriately thin myelinated fibers, and resolving subperineurial edema. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy associated with hypothyroidism was made. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated. Response to levothyroxine treatment was slow, with most neurologic abnormalities persisting for &gt;6 wk. However, the dog made a full neurologic recovery within 6 mo. Although the occurrence of polyneuropathy in dogs resulting from hypothyroidism has been controversial, the study authors demonstrated that hypothyroid polyneuropathy can occur in dogs as documented in humans. This is the first report describing long-term follow-up information together with detailed pathological features of hypothyroid polyneuropathy in a dog. In hypothyroid polyneuropathy, the response to thyroid replacement may be slow, but a recovery can be expected if treatment is initiated before peripheral nerve fiber loss becomes severe.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypothyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyneuropathies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Function Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroxine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this systematic review was to answer the a priori question, "Is there a surgical procedure that will allow a consistent return to normal clinical function in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament disease and is that procedure superior to others?" A systematic literature search was performed through September 2013. Peer reviewed publication in the English language and 6 mo of postoperative follow-up were required. In total, 444 manuscripts were identified and reviewed, and 34 met the inclusion criteria. Two studies provided level 1, 6 provided level 2, 6 provided level 3, and 20 provided level 4 evidence relative to the study question. The most common surgical procedures included tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO, n = 14), lateral extracapsular suture (n = 13), tibial tuberosity advancement (n = 6). The strength of the evaluated evidence most strongly supports the ability of the TPLO in the ability to return dogs to normal function. It also provided strong support that functional recovery in the intermediate postoperative time period was superior following TPLO compared with lateral extracapsular suture. There was insufficient data to adequately evaluate other surgical procedures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Recovery of Function</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Almost all treatment decisions regarding those bites are extrapolated from retrospective studies evaluating the clinical course of rattlesnake bites. Because copperheads and rattlesnakes produce venom with different potency, assumptions that treatment of the different envenomations should be similar may be incorrect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical course of copperhead envenomation in dogs and administered treatments. Medical records of 52 dogs treated for copperhead envenomation were reviewed, and owners were contacted regarding outcome. The most common clinical signs associated with copperhead envenomation included swelling, pain, and ecchymosis. Clinicopathological abnormalities (e.g., thrombocytopenia, elevated clotting times, leukocytosis) were mild, and red blood cell morphology changes and coagulopathies were rare. Most dogs were treated with antimicrobials, analgesics, and fluid therapy. No dogs in this study required the use of antivenin and all survived to discharge. This study found that the clinical course after copperhead envenomation is generally limited to local rather than systemic illness. Copperhead envenomation in dogs is largely self-limiting and responsive to supportive care with hospitalization for monitoring.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Agkistrodon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antivenins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Crotalid Venoms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergency Medical Services</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Snake Bites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Initial physical examination revealed bilateral retinal detachment, a left-sided head tilt, positional rotary nystagmus, and lumbar hyperpathia. Pertinent preliminary diagnostic findings included systemic hypertension, bony lysis and adjacent sclerosis of the vertebral endplates of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, and positive urine and blood cultures for a yeast identified as Candida spp. Concerned about disseminated candidiasis after subsequent subretinal aspirates confirmed the presence of a yeast-like organism, therapy with voriconazole was initiated. Because of progressive clinical deterioration and the poor prognosis for recovery, the dog was eventually euthanized. Postmortem histological examination of tissues, including the affected vertebral endplates, revealed numerous intralesional algae compatible with Prototheca spp. To the authors' knowledge, this report is the first to document a case of protothecal diskospondylitis with possible concurrent candidiasis in a dog. Although typically associated with signs referable to the gastrointestinal tract, this report underscores the importance of not excluding protothecosis as a differential diagnosis when such signs are absent. Lastly, the use of voriconazole appears ineffective for reversing the clinical course of late-stage disseminated protothecosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Candidiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Euthanasia, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prototheca</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spondylitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records and sonograms of 50 animals diagnosed with either mediastinal thymoma (n = 35) or lymphoma (n = 15) between January 2005 and February 2012 were reviewed. Cases with definitive cytological and/or histological diagnoses of either thymoma or lymphoma were included in this study. Masses were characterized by echogenicity, presence or absence of cysts, shape, margination, vascularity, and presence of effusion. Many thymomas (57.1%) were sonographically cystic in appearance and nearly all were heterogeneous (94%) in echogenicity compared with lymphoma (P = .0028). Lymphomatous lymph nodes were more likely to be solid (80%) and were equally divided between hypoechoic (47%) and heterogeneous (53%) echogenicities. Sonographic findings of either internal cysts or a heterogeneous echogenicity in mediastinal masses may be suggestive of a thymoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this study was to determine in vitro if four over-the-counter (OTC) dry dog foods carrying a "no soy" claim and seven veterinary therapeutic dry dog foods designed for food elimination trials were suitable for a soybean elimination trial. A 100 g sample of each diet plus one soy positive and one soy negative control diet were submitted for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing to an independent food laboratory. The positive control diet contained &gt;25 ppm soy protein antigens and the negative control contained &lt;2.5 ppm. Three of the four OTC "no soy" claiming diets were positive for soy antigen. Two of the three soy-containing diets had &gt;25 ppm. Three veterinary therapeutic diets had less than the lowest detectable limit of soy protein and four were positive (&gt;2.5 ppm). OTC dog food diets that claim to contain "no soy" may contain high concentrations of soy protein and, therefore, should not be used in soy elimination trials in suspect food allergic dogs. The veterinary therapeutic diet selected for a soy elimination trial needs to be carefully chosen based on diet history.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antigens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Hypersensitivity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soybean Proteins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Long overdue, the veterinary profession must address quality assurance (QA) of diagnostic testing. Each practice must weigh the responsibility for laboratory instrumentation test results that are often a combination of in-clinic and send-out testing. Challenges faced by clinic staff maintaining in-clinic laboratories include lack of training in QA and quality control (QC), lack of emphasis placed on QA/QC by instrument suppliers, QC financial and time costs, and a general lack of laboratory QA/QC support resources in the veterinary community. Possible solutions include increased continuing education opportunities and the provision of guidelines and other resources by national veterinary organizations; specialty certification of veterinary technicians; an increasing role of veterinary clinical pathologists as QA/QC consultants; and development of external quality assessment programs aimed at veterinary practices. The potential exists for animal health companies to lead in this effort by innovating instrument design, providing QC services, and exploiting instrument connectivity to monitor performance. Veterinary laboratory QA/QC is a neglected aspect of the profession. In coming years, veterinarians will hopefully find increased support for this core practice component.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clinical Laboratory Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnostic Errors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Point-of-Care Systems</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality Assurance, Health Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Treatment was continued for 21 days. Dogs were evaluated weekly for clinical effect and at the end of the treatment for hematologic and biochemical adverse events. Whole blood concentrations of artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry after the first dose of artemisinin in three dogs in each group. Blood concentrations of artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin were &lt;0.1 &#956;M at all time points, and there was no difference in blood concentration between the two dosing groups. The most frequent adverse event was anorexia, which was observed in 11% of the low-dose group and 29% of the high-dose group. Oral artemisinin, both in low-dose continuous and high-dose intermittent, is well tolerated in dogs but results in low bioavailability.

The dog had a recent onset of hematuria and stranguria but otherwise appeared to be healthy. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass in the urinary bladder. The dog was sedated and a 10-French rubber catheter that had the blunt end removed was passed from the urethra to the urinary bladder. Using ultrasound guidance, ellipsoid cup biopsy forceps were advanced through the rubber catheter to the urinary bladder mass and biopsies were successfully obtained. The dog was discharged from the hospital a few hours after the procedure. Histopathology of the mass was consistent with polypoid cystitis. Follow-up surgical removal of the polyp was uneventful, and histopathology confirmed the presurgical biopsy diagnosis. Procurement of urinary bladder biopsies through a urinary catheter with ultrasound guidance was used as a minimally invasive alternative to either cystoscopy or surgery in a bitch. Use of this technique achieved a diagnosis without the need for specialized endoscopic equipment, anesthesia, or surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyps</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Interventional</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Catheterization</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These study findings could then be compared with similar studies in dogs of all sizes. Ninety-eight procedures (82 dogs) using 2 or 2.7 mm TPLO plates were included spanning a 6 yr period with a minimum of an 8 wk follow-up period. The overall complication rate was 36%. Complications were grouped into three categories: intraoperative (2%), those occurring up to 2 wk postoperatively (11%), and those occurring &gt;2 wk postoperatively (30%). Radiographic evidence of delayed healing of the TPLO osteotomy site was the most common complication in the dogs (9%), none of which had clinical signs attributed to delayed healing. Other common complications included patellar tendon thickening (8%) and tibial tuberosity fracture (6%). Seven percent of the complications were considered major (requiring additional surgical intervention). Fifty-two percent of complications did not require treatment.

After being presented for a superficial pyoderma with possible dermatophyte coinfection, treatment with a cephalosporin and ketoconazole were prescribed. One wk later, colchicine was initiated for familial shar pei fever using cautious dose escalation. Nevertheless, gastrointestinal toxicity, skeletal muscle myopathy, and hepatotoxicity developed within 2 wk. Abrupt resolution of gastrointestinal toxicity and myopathy followed drug withdrawal. However, escalating liver enzyme activity and hyperbilirubinemia led to liver biopsy to rule out an antecedent hepatopathy. Biopsy characterized canalicular cholestasis and colchicine-associated metaphase arrest and ring mitoses reflecting repression of mitotic spindle formation. Signs of illness completely resolved 3 mo after drug discontinuation. Although avoidable adverse interactions between ketoconazole and drugs reliant on cytochrome oxidase biotransformation and/or drug efflux mediated by multiple drug-resistant transporters are well documented in humans, these are rarely reported in veterinary patients. This case exemplifies an important and avoidable ketoconazole/colchicine drug interaction from which the patient completely recovered.

Computerized tomographic imaging under general anesthesia revealed, in both cases, complete tracheal transection. Hypoxic episodes during anesthesia were relieved by keeping the endotracheal tube (ETT) positioned in the cranial part of the transected trachea and by allowing spontaneous breathing. Surgical preparation was performed quickly, and patients were kept in a sternal position to improve ventilation and oxygenation, and were only turned into dorsal recumbency shortly before surgical incision. A sterile ETT was guided into the distal part of the transected trachea by the surgeon, at which point mechanical ventilation was started. Both animals were successfully discharged from hospital a few days after surgery. Rapid and well-coordinated teamwork seemed to contribute to the good outcome. Precise planning and communication between anesthetists, surgeons, and technicians, as well as a quick course of action prior to correct ETT positioning helped to overcome critical phases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bites and Stings</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rupture</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trachea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ultrasound was utilized to locate and sample fluid accumulations, and &#946;-hemolytic Streptococcus was isolated from the wounds. Development of systemic symptoms including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea as well as a lack of response to medical management prompted surgical intervention in both cases. During surgical exploration and debridement, disruption of intermuscular tissue planes was appreciated and necrotizing fasciitis (NF) was suspected. Negative-pressure wound therapy systems utilizing 120 mm Hg of continual negative pressure were applied to wounds for 5 and 4 days for the Akita and German shorthaired pointer, respectively. Resolution of infection was achieved and although the lesions were associated with limbs, amputation was avoided. In both cases, the results of histopathology were consistent with NF. NF is recognized as a rapidly progressive infection associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

A diagnosis of compressive and stretch neuropathy was made affecting the distal sciatic nerve branches. Physical therapy modalities included neuromuscular electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and low-level laser therapy. Other therapeutic modalities included the use of orthotics and progressive wound care.

The objectives of this study were to compare surgical time, complications, and postoperative pain in a group of cats undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy (LOVE), laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy (LAOVH), and ovariohysterectomy via celiotomy (COVH). Eighteen healthy cats were randomly assigned to undergo LOVE, LAOVH, or COVH. Severity of pain was monitored 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after surgery. Surgical time was significantly longer for LAOVH (mean &#177; standard deviation [SD], 51.6 &#177; 7.7 min) compared to COVH (mean &#177; SD, 21.0 &#177; 7.1 min) and LOVE (mean &#177; SD, 34.2 &#177; 11.2 min). There were no major intraoperative complications, although minor complications were more common in both laparoscopic groups. Cats sterilized via laparoscopy (LOVE and LAOVH) were statistically less painful than cats spayed via celiotomy (COVH) 4 hr following surgery. Results suggested that LOVE in cats is safe, can be performed in a comparable amount of time as COVH, and may result in less postoperative discomfort.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Uterine disorders were assessed in 50 pet rabbits. In 31 pet rabbits with suspected clinical uterine disease, medical records were further reviewed regarding clinical signs, diagnostic workup, treatment as well as the outcome itself. Uterine adenocarcinoma (54%) was most frequently diagnosed, followed by endometrial hyperplasia (26%). Serosanguineous vaginal discharge was the predominant clinical sign observed by the rabbit owners. In approximately 50% of the rabbits with suspected uterine disorders, abdominal palpation revealed enlarged and/or irregular masses in the caudoventral abdomen indicating uterine lesions. Out of 23 rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy, four were either euthanized or died shortly after surgery because they were clinically unstable. Overall, 80% of the ovariohysterectomized animals were still alive 6 mo after surgery. In female pet rabbits that are not breeding, either ovariohysterectomy should be performed at an early age or routine checks including ultrasonography of the abdomen are recommended on a regular basis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adenocarcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adenoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endometrial Hyperplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leiomyoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leiomyosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyometra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Uterine Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records for 15 dogs with lameness attributable to the shoulder that failed previous conservative management were retrospectively reviewed. ESWT was delivered to those dogs q 3-4 wk for a total of three treatments. Short-term, in-hospital subjective lameness evaluation revealed resolution of lameness in three of nine dogs and improved lameness in six of nine dogs available for evaluation 3-4 wk following the final treatment. Long-term lameness score via telephone interview was either improved or normal in 7 of 11 dogs (64%). ESWT may result in improved function based on subjective patient evaluation and did not have any negative side effects in dogs with lameness attributable to instability, calcifying, and inflammatory conditions of the shoulder.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcinosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>High-Energy Shock Waves</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

There have been few reports of other parenchymal organ involvement. Dogs infected with Cryptococcus spp. are likely to develop central nervous system involvement, and those that are severely affected are treated aggressively with surgery and/or amphotericin B. This report describes two cases of canine abdominal cryptococcosis: one boxer with primary alimentary cryptococcosis alone and one miniature schnauzer with pancreatic and disseminated cryptococcosis. The boxer is unique in that the dog suffered from primary alimentary cryptococcosis without dissemination, secondary anemia due to gastrointestinal losses, and is the second case to have Cryptococcus spp. identified on fecal examination as part of the diagnostic workup. Unlike previous reports, surgery was not performed in either case, and both dogs were treated with fluconazole alone. Currently, both dogs are free from clinical signs, and Cryptococcus spp. antigen titers are negative at 17 and 15 mo after initial presentation. These cases suggest fluconazole may be effective therapy alone for canine abdominal cryptococcosis, negating the need for high-risk therapy options such as surgery and/or amphotericin B in some cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cryptococcosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluconazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The patient was circling to the left and blind in the right eye with right hemiparesis. Neurolocalization was to the left forebrain. MRI revealed a linear tract extending from the caudal oropharynx, through the left retrobulbar space and frontal lobe, into the left parietal lobe. A small skull fracture was identified in the frontal bone through which the linear tract passed. Those findings were consistent with iatrogenic trauma from slippage of a dental elevator during extraction of tooth 210. The dog was treated empirically with clindamycin. The patient regained most of its normal neurological function within the first 4 mo after the initial injury. Although still not normal, the dog has a good quality of life. Traumatic brain injury is a rarely reported complication of extraction. Care must be taken while performing dental cleaning and tooth extraction, especially of the maxillary premolar and molar teeth to avoid iatrogenic damage to surrounding structures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iatrogenic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tooth Extraction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twelve spayed female dogs were operated over a 2 yr period. No intraoperative complications were encountered. Transient dysuria was the most common postoperative complication (7 out of 12 dogs). On the 12th day postoperatively, incontinence was completely cured in 11 out of 12 dogs (92%). At the time of the second evaluation (median follow-up time was 21 mo), patients classified as "cured," "greatly improved," or "improved" were 25, 50, and 25% of the total, respectively. At the time of either the fourth evaluation or at the time of death (median follow-up time was 52 mo), 50% of the bitches (6 out of 12) had the same results as previously but the other 50% had leakage that reappeared sporadically. A fistula appeared on the path of the tape in two bitches at 28 and 32 mo postsurgically. The technique presented is effective and more cost effective than the standard technique and could constitute an attractive alternative; however, it could be associated with an immediate postoperative dysuria, delayed fistula formation, and a partial recurrence of clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suburethral Slings</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two weeks prior to presentation, the dog had porcupine quills removed from the left forepaw, muzzle, and sternal area. At the time of presentation, the dog had bounding pulses and friction rubs in the right dorsal lung field. Harsh lung sounds and decreased lung sounds were ausculted in multiple lung fields. Radiographs revealed a pneumothorax and rounding of the cardiac silhouette suggestive of pericardial effusion. Computed tomographic imaging was performed and revealed multiple porcupine quills in the thoracic cavity. Surgery was performed and quills were found in multiple lung lobes and the heart. Following surgery the dog remained hypotensive. A post-operative echocardiogram revealed multiple curvilinear soft-tissue opacities in the heart. Given the grave prognosis the dog was subsequently euthanized and a postmortem examination was performed. A single porcupine quill was discovered in the left atrium above the mitral valve annulus. The quill extended across the aortic root, impinging on the coronary artery below the level of the aortic valve. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first known report of porcupine quill migration through the heart.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign-Body Migration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Atria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Injury</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracic Cavity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Full-thickness intestinal biopsies obtained prior to transplantation revealed mild enteritis. Twelve months following transplantation, the patient underwent surgery for resection of a mesenteric mass causing septic peritonitis. The mesenteric mass was resected and an intestinal resection and anastomosis was performed. Extended-spectrum-&#946;-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was cultured from the resected tissue and urinary tract. Bacterial rods were noted to be circulating in the bloodstream, causing septicemia. Despite aggressive treatment of the septic peritonitis and septicemia using surgical debridement, drain placement, aggressive antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem, and vasopressor support, the patient succumbed to persistent hypotension and suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Extended-spectrum-&#946;-lactamase-producing bacteria are of growing concern in human and veterinary medicine, maintaining susceptibility often only to carbapenem and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Resistance to even those antibiotics is emerging. Veterinary patients with a history of antibiotic therapy, central venous or urinary catheterization, immunosuppression, enteric surgery, and an extended stay in the intensive care unit may be predisposed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Klebsiella Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Klebsiella pneumoniae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sepsis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Lactamases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this report, six unrelated dogs from three households were subsequently determined to have developed alopecia as a result of accidental transdermal exposure to their owners' topical hormone replacement therapy (THRT). All cases presented with alopecia ranging in duration from 2 mo to 2.5 yr. All dogs demonstrated alopecia affecting the ventral neck, thoracic and abdominal surfaces, proximal lateral extremities, and lateral trunk. At the time of initial presentation, five of six dogs were also noted to have physical exam findings suggestive of feminization. In all cases, serum total thyroxine was within normal reference range. Affected skin was biopsied in five dogs, and all samples demonstrated four similar histological characteristics: basal melanosis, epidermal and infundibular follicular hyperkeratosis, kenogen hair follicles, and small sebaceous glands. All dogs had elevated baseline estradiol levels, and four dogs had concurrent elevations of baseline progesterone. Average time to onset of clinical signs in those dogs was 5.5 mo after the owners started THRT. Following discontinuation of THRT by the owners, all dogs had complete resolution of their clinical signs by 5.5 mo.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Topical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Alopecia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estradiol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estrogen Replacement Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The 2015 guidelines summarize and offer a discriminating review of much of this new knowledge. Pain management is central to veterinary practice, alleviating pain, improving patient outcomes, and enhancing both quality of life and the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. The management of pain requires a continuum of care that includes anticipation, early intervention, and evaluation of response on an individual-patient basis. The guidelines include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities to manage pain; they are evidence-based insofar as possible and otherwise represent a consensus of expert opinion. Behavioral changes are currently the principal indicator of pain and its course of improvement or progression, and the basis for recently validated pain scores. A team-oriented approach, including the owner, is essential for maximizing the recognition, prevention, and treatment of pain in animals. Postsurgical pain is eminently predictable but a strong body of evidence exists supporting strategies to mitigate adaptive as well as maladaptive forms. Degenerative joint disease is one of the most significant and under-diagnosed diseases of cats and dogs. Degenerative joint disease is ubiquitous, found in pets of all ages, and inevitably progresses over time; evidence-based strategies for management are established in dogs, and emerging in cats. These guidelines support veterinarians in incorporating pain management into practice, improving patient care.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Acupuncture Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Analgesics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Measurement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Practice Guidelines as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Societies, Scientific</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, distortion artifact may mislead the radiographic interpreter as to the true anatomic location of the transfixing wires and either negatively impact patient healing or lead to unnecessary procedures. Distortion is due to unequal magnification of different parts of an object. The purpose of this study was to assess distortion of three circular external fixator apparatuses with the transfixing wires at 30, 60, and 90&#176;. Distortion was greatest with all three apparatuses at 10&#176; of rotation from parallel to the central X-ray beam. When comparing distortion between the three apparatuses, distortion was greatest with the transfixing wires at 30&#176;. The study authors concluded that distortion artifact is most severe when the transfixing wires are at smaller angles and when they are farther from the X-ray table. The circular external fixator should be placed in the center of, and parallel to, the primary X-ray beam and as close to the table as possible to reduce/prevent distortion artifact and possible radiographic misinterpretation of transfixing wire location.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Artifacts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equipment Design</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>External Fixators</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Of all of the urine specimens with significantly defined colony-forming units/mL, Enterococcus (E.) faecalis was the only enterococci isolated from cats and predominated (77.4%) in dogs followed by E. faecium (12.9%), E. durans (3.2%), and other Enterococcus spp. (6.5%). The majority of specimens with significant enterococcal growth resulted in complicated urinary tract infections in 83.9% of dogs and 81.8% of cats.

Radiographs were suggestive of a foreign body obstruction, and surgery was recommended. Resection and anastomosis of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum was performed. The dog recovered uneventfully, but approximately 36 hr postoperatively, he was found to have significant weakness and muscle tremors that were accompanied by hyperthermia. The only significant abnormality on a serum biochemical profile was a phosphorous level of 0.26 mmol/L. Within 6 hr of initiating phosphorous supplementation, the patient fully recovered and had no residual signs of neuromuscular dysfunction. Signs of neurologic dysfunction secondary to hypophosphatemia are commonly recognized in human patients. Reports of patients with severe muscle weakness, some of which necessitate ventilation due to weakening of muscles of respiration, are common throughout the literature. Less commonly, tremors are noted. This is the first known report of neuromuscular signs recognized and rapidly corrected in a dog. Although it is likely to be uncommon, hypophosphatemia should be recognized as a differential diagnosis in patients with tremors and/or muscle weakness.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypophosphatemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphorus, Dietary</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, two cases of a generalized variant of this disease have been reported, whose lesions responded to either systemic glucocorticoids or a combination of topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus, and the oral antimalarial hydroxychloroquine. The purpose of this report is to describe an 11 yr old shih tzu that presented with skin lesions consisting of multiple annular, erythematous papules and plaques, hyperpigmentation, adherent scaling, and atrophic scars over the caudal dorsum, flanks, craniodorsal thorax, and lateroproximal extremities. A diagnosis of generalized DLE was made based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, laboratory values, and direct immunofluorescence findings. Treatment consisted of oral tetracycline and oral niacinamide, which resulted in complete remission of clinical signs. This is the first documented report of generalized canine DLE responding to the described immunomodulating regimen. Such a combination might therefore be considered as a glucocorticoid and/or antimalarial alternative for the management of generalized DLE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Therapy, Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunomodulation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Niacinamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protein Synthesis Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tetracycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin B Complex</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

After induction of general anesthesia, but prior to the start of the surgery, air was inadvertently administered to the patient via the i.v. fluid line. The patient convulsed, became apneic, arrested, and died despite attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At necropsy, the pericardial sac was incised and filled with water to entirely submerge the intact heart. The right ventricular free wall was punctured, releasing several air bubbles from the right ventricle. Death was attributed to venous air embolism based on the clinical history, gross findings, and paucity of underlying gross and microscopic pathology that might have predisposed the dog to an anesthetic-related death. The discussion of this case includes a review of previously reported veterinary cases of fatal venous air embolism, including the varied mechanisms of embolus formation, the potential impact of pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, and the methods used to detect emboli. This report outlines the events of fatal iatrogenic venous air embolization and emphasizes the importance of considering this entity in the case of sudden death of a patient with an indwelling catheter in order to pursue either appropriate diagnostic tests or necropsy techniques to aid in the diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Embolism, Air</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Arrest</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hysterectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The cat had a 2 mo history of weight loss and intermittent vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound identified the presence of a large cavity measuring a maximum of 4.6 cm in the pancreas that was filled with a homogeneous echogenic fluid. Cytological analysis and culture of the fluid obtained from the pancreatic mass indicated the presence of a bacterial abscess.

A 5 yr old castrated male French bulldog (case 2) was presented with a 2 wk history of mild abdominal pain, dyschezia, and intermittent anorexia. Both dogs were diagnosed with chronic splenic torsion based on changes in splenic position, echogenicity, and/or echotexture identified on B-mode abdominal ultrasonography, as well as either decreased or absent splenic blood flow on color-flow Doppler ultrasonography. Both dogs underwent splenectomy and had full resolution of clinical signs. Presentation of chronic splenic torsion is variable, and clinical signs can be nonspecific. Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler evaluation is an important diagnostic step that can lead to appropriate surgical intervention and good long-term prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenic Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Torsion Abnormality</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MRI demonstrated an extradural, ovoid mass compressing the lumbar spinal cord. Surgical excision of the mass was performed. Histologically, the mass was consistent with hemangiosarcoma with no involvement of the adjacent vertebrae. The dog underwent a doxorubicin-based chemotherapy protocol with the addition of oral cyclophosphamide. After completion of chemotherapy, the dog was evaluated q 4 mo for restaging. Clinicopathological evidence of primary tumor recurrence or metastatic disease was not detected for 15 mo after initial diagnosis and treatment. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a primary extradural hemangiosarcoma in the lumbar vertebral column in a dog.

<Rec><Common><PMID>25955147</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>The renal effects of NSAIDs in dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The quality of life for dogs with osteoarthritis can often be improved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, the number of adverse drug events associated with NSAID use reported to the Federal Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine is higher than that for any other companion animal drug. Of those events, adverse renal reactions are the second most reported. NSAIDs produce pharmacologic effects via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which decreases production of prostanoids. Prostaglandins are synthesized by both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the healthy kidney and influence renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, renin release, and Na excretion. There are important species differences in the renal expression of COX-1 and COX-2. For example, dogs have higher basal levels of COX-2 expression in the kidney compared with humans. In addition, in dogs with chronic kidney disease, an increase in COX-2 expression occurs and synthesis of prostaglandins shifts to the COX-2 pathway. For those reasons, NSAIDs that target COX-2 may be expected to adversely affect renal function in dogs, especially dogs with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the literature to report the renal effects of NSAIDs in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Renal Insufficiency, Chronic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The dog's neurological status deteriorated drastically. It became comatose with bilateral mydriasis, and the pupillary light reflex was absent. An anti-inflammatory dose of methylprednisolone was administered, and temporary stabilization of neurological status was achieved. MRI findings were suggestive of ventriculitis and meningoencephalitis originating from the left tympanic cavity. A gadolinium leakage phenomenon was noted, likely resulting from severe damage to the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier during the inflammatory process. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and materials in the left tympanic cavity further confirmed the diagnosis. Following surgical and antibiotic treatment, the dog recovered well with only a mild residual head tilt. Seven months after surgery, the dog had a recurrent infection of the left tympanic cavity without intracranial involvement. A second surgery led to an uneventful recovery, and the dog was clinically normal except for a mild head tilt 3 yr after the initial presentation. This is the first report describing ventriculitis associated with otogenic meningoencephalitis in dogs and a gadolinium leakage phenomenon displayed on MRI. The long-term outcome of ventriculitis-complicated otogenic meningoencephalitis in dogs could be satisfied with prompt diagnosis and treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cerebral Ventriculitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Labyrinthitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningoencephalitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this retrospective study, we evaluated presentation, response to treatment, and toxicity in cats with MRD receiving systemic treatment. Previously reported prognostic factors were evaluated for their impact on survival in cats receiving chemotherapy. Of fifteen cases identified, thirteen received melphalan or cyclophosphamide +/- corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Chlorambucil was commonly used as rescue therapy in cats with progressive disease, or in cases of chemotherapy-related toxicity with first line agents. Overall response rates were 71% and 83% for melphalan- and cyclophosphamide-treated cats, respectively. Discontinuation of melphalan due to toxicity was common. Survival times for cats initially treated with melphalan or cyclophosphamide were not significantly different (median 252 and 394 days, respectively), and no statistically significant prognostic factors were identified. This study suggests that the combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids is well tolerated and may be considered as first-line therapy for cats with systemic MRD.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Multiple Myeloma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plasmacytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination showed a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur and an area of cutaneous atrophy overlying a midline supraumbilical wall defect. Thoracic radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasound examination revealed a congenital caudal sternal cleft, a supraumbilical diastasis rectus, and a patent ductus arteriosus. Exploratory surgery confirmed defects of the pars sternalis of the diaphragm and caudoventral pericardium and a persistent left cranial vena cava. Those findings were compatible with Cantrell's pentalogy. Surgical treatment included ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus through the sternal cleft, diaphragmatic reconstruction with paracostal extension of the diaphragmatic defect, pericardial and linea alba appositional reconstruction, and primary approximation of the sternal halves. Growth and exercise activity were normal 10 mo after surgery. The discovery of a midline cranial abdominal wall, pericardial, diaphragmatic, or sternal defect should prompt a thorough examination to rule out any possible associated syndrome. Cantrell's pentalogy presents various degrees of expression and is rare in dogs. Management involves early surgical repair of congenital anomalies to protect the visceral structures. The prognosis in dogs with mild forms of the syndrome is encouraging.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Musculoskeletal Abnormalities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pentalogy of Cantrell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sternum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Investigations revealed a marked increase in blood ammonia, low serum cobalamin, and increased levels of urinary methylmalonic acid (MMA) excretion. No liver vascular abnormality was detected. The patient was diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin malabsorption. The patient responded well to parenteral cobalamin administration, and the urinary MMA levels normalized rapidly following instigation of treatment. Due to the suspected hereditary nature of selective cobalamin deficiency, one sibling of this dog was screened and found to be normal. This is the first reported case of MMA secondary to hypocobalaminemia in Yorkshire terriers, and the second report of this disease in a dog in the United Kingdom. Given the fact that clinical signs of MMA are similar to those seen in dogs with portosystemic shunts and that Yorkshire terriers are predisposed to liver vascular abnormalities, this case report adds important clinical information to the current available literature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Malabsorption Syndromes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin B 12</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vitamin B 12 Deficiency</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-&#946;-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dihydrotestosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disorders of Sex Development</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Estradiol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gonads</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Progesterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex Differentiation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testosterone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Most dogs (68%) presented with a laceration to a thoracic limb footpad, and one-third of dogs were middle-aged castrated males. Metacarpal pads were most commonly injured. Short-term complications were noted in 27% of dogs. No long-term complications were identified. No disability from pad injury was present at the completion of healing. Concurrent injuries to adjacent structures were uncommon and did not affect outcome. Dogs with full-thickness pad lacerations were at greater risk for major short-term complications compared to dogs with partial-thickness pad lacerations (odds ratio, 7.27; P = .001). Military working dogs with full-thickness pad lacerations were at greater risk for major short-term complications than pet dogs with a similar injury. When major complications developed in dogs with full-thickness pad injuries, time to final healing was significantly longer (by a median of 12 days). The partial-thickness pad lesions healed uneventfully regardless of whether they were bandaged, surgically repaired, or left to heal by second intention. Suture repair and bandaging of full-thickness lesions could not be shown to either decrease the risk for complications or improve healing. Future work should focus on establishing standards for footpad treatment to reduce complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Military Personnel</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Some facility in veterinary behavioral and veterinary behavioral medicine is essential in modern veterinary practice. More cats and dogs are affected by behavioral problems than any other condition. Behavioral problems result in patient suffering and relinquishment and adversely affect staff morale. These guidelines use a fully inclusive team approach to integrate basic behavioral management into everyday patient care using standardized behavioral assessments; create a low-fear and low-stress environment for patients, staff and owners; and create a cooperative relationship with owners and patients so that the best care can be delivered. The guidelines' practical, systematic approach allows veterinary staff to understand normal behavior and recognize and intervene in common behavioral problems early in development.

Blood pressure measurements (n = 203) were obtained from 10 client-owned dogs. DOP, ISAP, and IMAP were recorded simultaneously, and the data were categorized into two groups: hypotensive (ISAP &lt;90 mm Hg) and normotensive (ISAP &#8805;90 mm Hg and &#8804;160 mm Hg). DOP overestimated ISAP and IMAP in both the normotensive and hypotensive groups. The DOP was highly specific (97%) but poorly sensitive (56%) for detecting hypotension. The smallest bias was achieved when using DOP as an estimate of systolic arterial blood pressure in both normotensive and hypotensive dogs, suggesting that DOP measures systolic arterial blood pressure in dogs &lt;5 kg. For dogs with hypotension, DOP met all of the performance criteria for noninvasive blood pressure monitors recommended by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.

This retrospective medical records review included canine cases with urine samples submitted for Histoplasma EIA antigen assay between 2007 and 2011 from three veterinary institutions. Cases for which urine samples were submitted for Histoplasma antigen testing were reviewed and compared to the gold standard of finding Histoplasma organisms or an alternative diagnosis on cytology or histopathology. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and the kappa coefficient and associated confidence interval were calculated for the EIA-based Histoplasma antigen assay. Sixty cases met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen cases were considered true positives based on identification of the organism, and 41 cases were considered true negatives with an alternative definitive diagnosis. Two cases were considered false negatives, and there were no false positives. Sensitivity was 89.47% and the negative predictive value was 95.35%. Specificity and the positive predictive value were both 100%. The kappa coefficient was 0.9207 (95% confidence interval, 0.8131-1).

A lack of parasite burden was confirmed 9 wk postdiagnosis; however, serum biochemical analysis at that time was suggestive of ongoing hepatic dysfunction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Angiostrongylus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antinematodal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fenbendazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Granuloma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatitis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Macrolides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Strongylida Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Due to the small size of the patient, flexible endoscopy could not be performed through the lumen of a tracheal tube. Following IV induction of general anesthesia, the airway was instrumented with a laryngeal mask airway that was attached via a three-way connector to an anesthesia breathing circuit. A flexible endoscope was passed through the free port of the connector. That arrangement allowed for the passage of an endoscope through the lumen of the laryngeal mask airway and into the trachea without interrupting the continuous supply of O2 and sevoflurane.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchoscopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bronchoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laryngeal Masks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trachea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26355585</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Severe Pit Viper Envenomation with Extended Clinical Signs and Treatment Complications in a Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>This manuscript describes the extended clinical abnormalities that can occur in severe snake envenomation and the clinical signs associated with antivenom hypersensitivity in a 3 yr old dog. Treatment consisted of IV fluid therapy, analgesics, a vasopressor, cardiac antiarrhythmia drugs, and polyvalent pit viper antivenom. Following initial response to treatment, relapse of clinical signs occurred. Most interesting was the recrudescence of clinical signs on day 7 that may have been caused by the release of deposited venom during surgical debridement of necrotic skin. The resulting extensive clinical signs required multiple vials of antivenom (22 vials over a 7 day period). Both F(ab')2 antivenom and antivenin (Crotalidae) polyvalent were used in this dog because of availability logistics. It is thought that this large amount of antivenom resulted in type I (anaphylaxis) and type III hypersensitivity (serum sickness) reactions. The dog made a complete clinical recovery. This description of extended, fluctuating clinical abnormalities that were associated with envenomation together with the development of hypersensitivity reactions that were presumably secondary to antivenom administration is information that can be useful for the management of patients afflicted with severe pit viper envenomation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antivenins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Crotalid Venoms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Snake Bites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viperidae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Plasma aldosterone concentration was increased at the time of admission (651 pmol/L), but serum creatinine and potassium concentrations were within the reference range. A second increased aldosterone (879 pmol/L) and normal plasma renin activity (1.85 ng/mL/hr) resulted in an increased aldosterone/renin ratio, which was suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA). To further support the diagnosis of PHA, the urinary aldosterone/creatinine ratio was calculated both before and after oral administration of fludrocortisone acetate (0.05 mg/kg q 12 hr for 4 consecutive days). The urinary aldosterone/creatinine ratio was 92.6 &#215; 10(-9) before fludrocortisone administration and 155.8 &#215; 10(-9) 4 days later. Absence of suppression was typical of PHA. The cat had a limited response to antihypertensive medication and died before treatment for PHA could be instituted. A necropsy was not permitted by the owner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aldosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fatal Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fludrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperaldosteronism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thoracic radiographs revealed a 6 cm diameter mass within the right caudal thorax. Thoracic ultrasound identified an intrathoracic mass ultrasonographically consistent with liver tissue and a chronic diaphragmatic hernia was suspected. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, but no evidence of a diaphragmatic hernia was identified. Thoracic exploration identified abnormal lung parenchyma. The accessory lung lobe was removed using a stapling devise near its base. The consolidated mass had the gross appearance of liver and was histologically identified as ectopic hepatic tissue. Ectopic hepatic tissue, unlike ectopic splenic and pancreatic tissue, is rare and generally has a subdiaphragmatic distribution. This solitary case report demonstrates that ectopic intrathoracic hepatic tissue should be considered a differential diagnosis for a caudal mediastinal mass.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Choristoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination findings included lameness of the right forelimb, muscle atrophy around the right shoulder, grade 2/6 heart murmur, and moderate dental disease. Results of a complete blood cell count and serum biochemical analysis were unremarkable with the exception of a mildly increased alkaline phosphatase (368 U/L; reference range, 128-328 U/L). Radiographs of the right elbow revealed a mixed lytic and proliferative osseous lesion most consistent with either neoplasia or infection. Thoracic radiographs and the echocardiogram were unremarkable. Fine-needle aspiration of the bone lesion was performed. The cytological diagnosis was chondrosarcoma. The right forelimb was amputated and the axillary lymph nodes were collected. Histopathological examination of the bone lesion and axillary lymph nodes revealed chondrosarcoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes.

To determine the prevalence of helminths in a contemporary population of cats and evaluate the ability of fecal flotation to detect these infections, helminths were recovered from intestinal tracts removed from 116 adult cats humanely euthanized by an animal control shelter in northeastern Oklahoma. Results were compared to those of fecal flotation performed using both passive and centrifugal techniques. Helminths were identified in 78/116 (67.2%) cats, including Toxocara cati (48/116; 41.4%), Ancylostoma tubaeforme (8/116; 6.9%), Dipylidium caninum (40/116; 34.5%), and Taenia taeniaeformis (30/116; 25.9%). Cats with T. cati were significantly more likely to harbor T. taeniaeformis (P = .001) than cats without ascarids. Centrifugal fecal flotation with sugar solution identified 37/48 (77.1%) T. cati infections, 8/30 (26.7%) T. taeniaeformis infections, and no D. caninum infections. Proglottids were detected on external examination in 19.0% (12/63) of cats with cestodes. Cestodes were present in over half of the cats examined in this study, but the majority of these infections were not evident by the detection of external proglottids or recovery of characteristic stages on fecal flotation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Helminthiasis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26535454</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Coagulase-Positive Staphylococcus: Prevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance.</Title>	<Abstract>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the most prevalent coagulase-positive Staphylococcus inhabitant of the skin and mucosa of dogs and cats, causing skin and soft tissue infections in these animals. In this study, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species were isolated from companion animals, veterinary professionals, and objects from a clinical veterinary environment by using two particular culture media, Baird-Parker RPF agar and CHROMagar Staph aureus. Different morphology features of colonies on the media allowed the identification of the species, which was confirmed by performing a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among 23 animals, 15 (65.2%) harbored coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, being 12 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius carriers. Four out of 12 were methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP). All veterinary professionals had coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (CoPS) species on their hands and two out of nine objects sampled harbored MRSP. The antimicrobial-resistance pattern was achieved for all isolates, revealing the presence of many multidrug-resistant CoPS, particularly S. pseudintermedius . The combined analysis of the antimicrobial-resistance patterns shown by the isolates led to the hypothesis that there is a possible crosscontamination and dissemination of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius species between the three types of carriers sampled in this study that could facilitate the spread of the methicillin-resistance phenotype.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteriological Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carrier State</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coagulase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Environmental Microbiology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Objectives of this study were to identify the predominant Corynebacterium species present in lesions of canine dermatitis, assess pathogenic role, determine antimicrobial susceptibility, and evaluate clinical response. Of 37 isolates identified as Corynebacterium, 31 were Corynebacterium auriscanis . Most Corynebacterium isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol (97%), tetracyclines (92%), and amikacin (89%); isolate susceptibilities to &#946;-lactams, trimethoprim-sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones were &lt;50%. Most cultures grew mixed populations of bacteria; C. auriscanis was the only organism isolated in three patients. At recheck, 2-8 wk after initial presentation, pleomorphic rods were absent or significantly decreased in all patients. Two of three C. auriscanis isolates were obtained in pure culture and were evaluable, meaning patient had an initial exam and recheck examination. Both patients were already on antimicrobials to which C. auriscanis was resistant in vitro. Both improved after doxycycline administration. C. auriscanis may act as an opportunistic pathogen in canine dermatitis and may not respond to antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibilities for other organisms in mixed infections. Occasionally, Corynebacterium isolated alone may be pathogenic.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corynebacterium Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases, Bacterial</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The owner also reported that the dog had previously exhibited other symptoms, including intermittent vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia for several yr. The initial workup revealed a marked decrease in ionized calcium and total protein. Further diagnostics revealed decreases in magnesium, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, albumin, and globulins, and an increased parathyroid hormone level. Intestinal biopsies revealed inflammatory bowel disease and lymphangiectasia. The dog received intravenous calcium gluconate for treatment of hypocalcemia followed by oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Seizure activity ceased once calcium levels approached the normal range. Medical and dietary therapy for lymphangiectasia and inflammatory bowel disease consisted of prednisone, rutin, and a low-fat diet. Decreased serum total ionized calcium levels have been reported previously in dogs with protein-losing enteropathies. Typically, the hypocalcemia is not associated with clinical signs. Severe clinical signs of hypocalcemia are rarely reported in dogs with protein-losing enteropathy, but seizures, facial twitching, and tremors can occur. When presented with a dog with a history of seizure activity, panhypoproteinemia, and hypocalcemia, protein-losing enteropathy should be included on the list of differential diagnoses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Calcium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypocalcemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphangiectasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protein-Losing Enteropathies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seizures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination revealed a caudal abdominal mass and bilateral shoulder pain. A complete blood count, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis were unremarkable. Thoracic radiographs demonstrated bony proliferation and lysis of the third sternebra, an expansile lesion of the left tenth rib, and lucency in both proximal humeral metaphyses. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound revealed a soft tissue mass within the caudoventral right abdomen. Ultrasonography also revealed an enlarged lymph node within the right retroperitoneal space. Exploratory laparotomy identified the mass as a retained testicle. A cryptorchidectomy, lymph node biopsy, and bilateral percutaneous core biopsies of the proximal humeri were performed. Histopathologic examination revealed malignant seminoma of the testicle with metastasis to lymph node and bone. Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended, but it was declined by the owner. All follow-up was lost. This case highlights a unique case for causative hyperesthesia secondary to a novel site of metastasis from malignant seminoma.

On abdominal ultrasonography, numerous nodules were detected in the hepatic parenchyma distributed diffusely throughout all lobes. Excisional biopsy of one of the nodules was performed via exploratory laparotomy. A histopathological diagnosis of the lesion was carcinoid, and the tumor cells stained positive to chromogranin A and gastrin. The serum gastrin level of the dog was 45,613 pg/mL (reference range: 160-284). In addition to medical treatment with omeprazole(c) and famotidine(e), suppression of gastrin secretion was attempted with octreotide acetate. A test dose of octreotide acetate significantly decreased the serum gastrin level to approximately one third of the baseline in 2 hr and the effect lasted approximately for 6 hr. On day 21, treatment with sustained-release formulation of octreotide acetate(a) (5 mg intramuscular, q 4 wk) was initiated. The serum gastrin concentration gradually decreased over 32 days and then progressively increased in parallel with the progression of the hepatic nodules. The dog gradually developed recurrence of initial clinical signs, and was lost to follow-up on day 510.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Ulcer Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Delayed-Action Preparations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Famotidine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Octreotide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Omeprazole</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The left eye had been enucleated 5 yr previously. Intermittent mild-to-moderate left orbital swelling had been noted by the owner since the initial surgery. Examination demonstrated a moderate-to-severe, soft, fluctuant swelling involving the left orbit with erythema of the overlying skin. Crepitus was noted over the occipital tuberosity. Computed tomography revealed a large volume of gas involving the left orbit. The gas extended caudally within the subcutaneous tissues to both hemimandibles, dorsal to the cranium, and partially surrounded the cranial neck. The presence of a mucosa-lined, air-filled space with a patent nasolacrimal duct was noted on orbital exploration. The lining was removed and the duct closed. Histopathology confirmed the presence of an epithelial lining. No recurrence of the swelling was observed on examination 8 wk after surgery. This is the first report documenting acute worsening of orbital swelling following an episode of respiratory distress. This case highlights the importance of addressing the nasolacrimal duct while performing an enculeation in a brachycephalic dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emphysema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Exophthalmos</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eye Enucleation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orbital Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Subcutaneous Emphysema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neurological signs were consistent with a lesion involving the pons and rostral medulla resulting in deficits in the function of the trigeminal, facial, and vestibular nerves. MRI disclosed a right-sided extraparenchymal mass consistent with a trigeminal nerve sheath neoplasm that was compressing and invading the pons and medulla. Atrophy of the muscles of mastication, innervated by the trigeminal nerve, was also observed on MRI. Additionally, effusion was present in the ipsilateral tympanic cavity. Gross and microscopic evaluation of the right tensor veli palatini muscle (TVPM) was consistent with neurogenic atrophy. Effusion in the tympanic cavity was likely the result of an inability to open the auditory tube as a consequence of paralysis of the TVPM. Without the ability to open the auditory tube, gases present within the auditory tube and tympanic cavity may be absorbed, creating a negative pressure environment that leads to fluid transudation and effusion build up. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to document neurogenic atrophy of the TVPM with concurrent effusion in the ipsilateral tympanic cavity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cranial Nerve Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Denervation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear, Middle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Facial Muscles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mandibular Nerve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otitis Media with Effusion</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pharynx</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trigeminal Nerve</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>26606201</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Clinical Characteristics of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in 19 cats from a Single Institution (1980-2013).</Title>	<Abstract>Clinical features of feline hepatocellular carcinoma (HCA) have been poorly characterized. In this retrospective study, we describe the signalment, clinical features, clinicopathologic parameters, imaging characteristics, hepatic mass size and lobe distribution, concurrent disorders, and survival in 19 cats with HCA. HCA is a rare neoplasm in elderly cats often associated with weight loss, hyporexia, and increased hepatic transaminase activities. Concurrent disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, cholangiohepatitis, copper-associated hepatopathy) often confounded interpretation of clinical and clinicopathologic findings; 42% of HCA were incidentally identified. Although an abdominal mass was palpated in only 21% of cats, many cats had masses identified on ultrasonographic imaging with 47% having lesions &gt;4 cm. Tumors were nearly equally distributed between right and left liver lobes, and two cats had HCA in multiple liver lobes. Median survival of eight cats diagnosed antemortem was 1.7 (0.6 to 6.5) yr.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of sucralfate as a phosphate binder in normal cats and normophosphatemic CKD cats. A 500 mg sucralfate slurry was administered orally q 8 hr for 2 wk, and serum phosphorus, urine fractional excretion of phosphorus, and fecal phosphorus concentrations were measured. In normal cats treated with sucralfate, significant changes in serum phosphorus concentration or urinary excretion of phosphorus were not detected, and vomiting occurred after 14.7% of administrations. Of the five normophosphatemic cats with CKD treated with sucralfate, three experienced clinical decompensation, including vomiting, anorexia, constipation, and increased azotemia. Administration of sucralfate did not result in significant changes in fecal phosphorus concentration in these cats. The effects of sucralfate administration on serum phosphorus concentration and urinary excretion of phosphorus in CKD cats was difficult to determine because of dehydration and worsening azotemia associated with decompensation. Due to side effects and the apparent lack of efficacy of the medication, the study was discontinued. This study was unable to confirm efficacy of this sucralfate formulation as a phosphate binder, and side effects were problematic during the study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Ulcer Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phosphorus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Renal Insufficiency, Chronic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sucralfate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This retrospective study aimed to characterize the presenting complaint, clinical findings, location of organisms, and final diagnosis of dogs in which yeast morphologically consistent with C. guttulatus were identified at a veterinary teaching hospital from 2006-2013. The prevalence of C. guttulatus infection in a general population of dogs from a regional animal shelter was also determined. Nineteen dogs were retrospectively identified as diagnosed with C. guttulatus infection. Among these, 79% presented with a chief complaint and/or clinical signs consistent with gastrointestinal tract disease. The most common clinical sign was chronic diarrhea. The majority of dogs had C. guttulatus identified cytologically within samples obtained from the gastrointestinal tract; however, four dogs had C. guttulatus identified in non-gastrointestinal tract samples, including a nasal biopsy (one dog) and urine (three dogs). C. guttulatus was not identified in any of 105 shelter dogs evaluated, suggesting low prevalence of C. guttulatus in our region. These findings suggest that additional studies to determine if C. guttulatus is a potential cause or consequence of gastrointestinal illness in dogs may be warranted.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascomycota</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The positive controls (n = 10) received subcutaneous (SQ) hydromorphone (0.2 mg/kg) and 1.5 mL of blank liposomes before surgery; fentanyl continuous rate infusion (CRI), 5-10 &#956;g/kg/hr IV, during and for 24 hr after surgery; and a fentanyl patch at extubation. The negative controls (n = 7) received SQ hydromorphone (0.2 mg/kg) and 1.5 mLs of blank liposomes SQ before surgery, fentanyl CRI (5-10 &#956;g/kg/hr IV) during surgery but stopped at extubation, and a fentanyl patch at extubation. The test group (n = 11) received 3 mg/kg of LE-hydro and 1.5 mL of saline SQ before surgery, 1.5 mL of saline SQ, and a saline CRI during surgery. All groups received a bupivacaine block in the limb prior to amputation and carprofen prior to surgery. Treatment failures, pain scores, opioid side effects, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and client-reported pain and side effects were evaluated. There were three treatment failures in the positive control (3/10) and test groups (3/11). Negative controls had seven treatment failures (7/7). Side effects for all three groups were within expected limits.

Study objectives include: (1) determine hospital prevalence of urinary incontinence in juvenile female soft-coated wheaten terriers (SCWTs) compared to other affected dogs; (2) characterize anatomic anomalies affecting urinary incontinent juvenile female SCWTs utilizing uroendoscopy; and (3) compare incidence of ectopic ureters, paramesonephric remnants, and short urethras in juvenile female urinary incontinent SCWTs to other juvenile female dogs with urinary incontinence. We hypothesize juvenile SCWTs have an increased prevalence of urinary incontinence and an increased incidence of ectopic ureters, paramesonephric remnants, and short urethras compared to non-SCWTs with urinary incontinence within our hospital population. Medical records of female dogs 6 mo of age and younger with clinical signs of urinary incontinence and video uroendoscopic evaluation presenting to The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center from January 2000 to December 2011 were reviewed. Twelve juvenile SCWTs and 107 juvenile non-SCWTs met the inclusion criteria. Juvenile SCWTs were found to have an increased hospital prevalence of urinary incontinence compared to other affected breeds. Observed anomalies in SCWTs include: ectopic ureters, shortened urethras, paramesonephric remnants, and bifid vaginas. This information will help guide veterinarians in recognizing a breed-related disorder of the lower urogenital tract in SCWTs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urogenital Abnormalities</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It is known to cause moderate to intense pruritus, often manifested as self-induced alopecia and excoriations. 10% imidacloprid/1% moxidectin (a) is a monthly, topical solution indicated for the treatment and/or prevention of fleas, heartworms, intestinal parasites, and ear mites. A household of cats was presented for pruritus that ranged from mild to severe in 8 of the 13 felines. The most common clinical signs included miliary-type papular dermatitis and focal areas of erythema associated with alopecia. Multiple skin scrapings of each animal revealed Demodex gatoi mites in only two cats. Weekly topical administration of 10% imidacloprid/1% moxidectin was used on all cats in the household for a total of ten doses. Skin scrapings following treatment were negative, and all cats in the house improved. Based on the successful treatment of this small number of cats, weekly application of 10% imidacloprid/1% moxidectin should be considered for the clinical resolution of cats affected by D. gatoi.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Combinations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Imidazoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insecticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Macrolides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mite Infestations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neonicotinoids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nitro Compounds</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records from the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were reviewed and two dogs diagnosed with sialolithiasis (calcium oxalate) were identified between 1990 and 2010. The two dogs had cervical or pharyngeal sialocele and were successfully treated by sialolith removal and concurrent sialoadenectomy. Signalments of dogs with sialolithiasis between 1964 and 2010 were collected from the Veterinary Medical Database and evaluated. Several breeds of dogs were represented and the 10 to &lt;15 yr old age group was shown to have significant association with sialolithiasis. Sialolithiasis is a rare veterinary condition.

CanL was diagnosed using cytology in one case and indirect immunofluorescence assay and conventional polymerase chain reaction in the second. Specific therapy with meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol(c) led to short-term remission in both dogs and normalization of serum viscosity. Although dogs rarely develop HVS, it should be suspected if hyperproteinemia and monoclonal gammopathy are present.

Although our review of the literature on the management of canine STS found many of the studies to be less than rigorous, board-certified specialists in internal medicine, surgery, pathology, oncology, and radiation oncology were able to make several recommendations based on the literature review: cytology and biopsy are important for presurgical planning; wide (&gt;3 cm margins) surgical excision decreases the likelihood of tumor recurrence; the use of a histologic grading scale is useful in predicting biologic behavior; and, in select cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be beneficial adjunct treatments to surgical excision. More research is necessary to determine minimum size of surgical margins, the impact of radiation therapy on incompletely resected tumors, the ideal chemotherapy protocol for high grade STS, and the optimal methods of monitoring dogs for tumor recurrence and metastasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Evidence-Based Medicine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soft Tissue Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative bioavailability of GS for liquid, chewable, and tablet formulations containing GS sulfate or hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate. In a randomized cross-over design, supplements were administered daily for 8 days with a 1 wk washout period between treatments. Liquid or Tablet A was administered to four dogs, whereas Liquid or Tablet B was administered to four additional dogs. When nutraceutical exposure was normalized to the administered dose of GS free base, similar relative bioavailabilities were determined for all three formulations. However, the dose-normalized maximum plasma GS concentration was higher for the liquid supplement (5.5 &#177; 0.5 &#956;g/mL) than for the two tablets (3.1 &#177; 0.6 and 2.1 &#177; 0.6 &#956;g/mL, P &lt; 0.001).

In veterinary medicine, shaving of hair is necessary prior to many procedures. Contaminated clipper blades have been cited as potential fomites involved in the transmission of pathogens in veterinary and human medicine. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate bacterial contamination of clipper blades in veterinary practices. A secondary goal was to assess whether there was an association between bacterial contamination of clipper blades and clipper blade cleaning solutions, clipper blade cleaning protocols, clipper blade storage, and type of practice. Sixty clipper blades from 60 different practices were cultured. Information regarding blade cleaning solutions, protocols, and storage was collected from each practice. Fifty-one percent (31/60) of clipper blades sampled were contaminated with bacteria. Category of cleaning solutions had a significant association with bacterial contamination (P &lt; 0.02). Cleaning frequency (P = 0.55), storage location (P = 0.26), and practice type (P = 0.06) had no significant association with bacterial contamination.

Thirty-five records met the criteria for each of the FSB and epidural analgesia groups. Seventeen anesthesia records met the criteria for the NRA or control group. The parameters reported were: isoflurane vaporizer setting, rescue analgesia/anesthesia drugs received, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and recovery quality (0-4, with 0 being poor and 4 being good). Rescue analgesia-anesthesia during surgery was performed with either fentanyl, ketamine, or propofol. A larger percentage of dogs in the NRA group required rescue analgesia during surgery. The FSB group had a higher recovery quality with median (95% confidence interval of four (&#177;0.3) when compared to two (&#177;0.8) in NRA (p &lt; 0.01). No difference between groups was observed on any other parameter reported.

This retrospective study consists of 74 client-owned dogs with bilateral cranial cruciate ligament rupture that underwent consecutive single-session bilateral TTAs. Radiographs from 74 dogs (148 stifles) were evaluated for evidence of postoperative complications. One hundred forty-three of 148 stifles were scored for radiographic healing using a previously described scoring system. Variables evaluated for a relationship with radiographic complications and healing scores were: breed, age, body weight, sex, and TTA plate type. The overall radiographic complication rate was 17.6% (13/74). Twelve of the 13 radiographic complications were considered to be minor and one was major. Increasing body weight and use of a fork implant were statistically significant factors associated with an increased risk of complication. One hundred forty-three stifle radiographs met the inclusion criteria to be assessed for healing. The mean score was 2.96 out of 4.0. The overall radiographic complication rate and healing scores associated with single-session bilateral TTAs were found to be similar to those described for unilateral TTA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orthopedic Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

GB contents were evaluated during 200 sequential ultrasonographic scans performed at a veterinary school, and sludge was quantified using a 1-5 scale. GB volume was retrospectively estimated from stored images. Medical records were used to determine patient demographics, clinicopathologic findings, and diagnoses/disorders. The majority of dogs (66.5%) had some hyperechoic material within the GB. Four dogs were diagnosed with a mucocele. For statistical purposes, dogs with uniformly nonechogenic bile or minimal sludge (80.5%) were compared to those with &gt;25% sludge (17.5%). Dogs with &gt;25% sludge were significantly older than those with minimal sludge (8 versus 11 yr). Serum cholesterol and bilirubin concentrations and activities of both alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase were not correlated with the presence of GB sludge. Dogs with spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism or hypothyroidism were more likely to have &gt;25% sludge (odds ratio: 5.04). In addition, &gt;25% sludge was associated with increased GB volume, suggesting that changes in GB function or contractility may impact the formation of biliary sludge in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bile</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gallbladder Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We used a protocol with shorter inter-treatment intervals than standard, but which we expected to still be well-tolerated, based on drugs known to be active agents, with the aim of improving outcomes by increasing dose intensity. Thirty-eight dogs with confirmed appendicular osteosarcoma and no pulmonary metastases that underwent amputation followed by this chemotherapy protocol were retrospectively evaluated. The median survival time was 317 days and 1- and 2-yr survival percentages were 43.2% and 13.9%, respectively. Toxicity was comparable to that seen with other standard dose protocols, with 5.2% of dogs hospitalized for complications that resolved with supportive care and no chemotherapy-related mortality. Serum alkaline phosphatase level (normal or high) (p = 0.004) and whether or not chemotherapy was completed (p = 0.001) were found to significantly impact survival time on multivariate analysis. Outcomes were similar to those reported with most other published chemotherapy protocols for dogs with this disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amputation, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carboplatin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neurologic examination revealed pelvic limb ataxia and cervical spinal hyperesthesia. Spinal reflexes and cranial nerve examination were normal. The pathology was localized to the C1-C5 or C6-T2 spinal cord segments. Computed tomography (CT) findings indicated bony proliferation of the caudal articular processes of C6 and the cranial articular processes of C7, resulting in bilateral dorsolateral spinal cord compression that was more pronounced on the left side. A limited dorsal laminectomy was performed at C6-C7. Due to progressive neurological deterioration, follow-up CT examination was performed 4 days postoperatively. At the level of the laminectomy defect, a subfacial seroma had developed, entering the spinal canal and causing significant spinal cord compression. Under ultrasonographic guidance a closed-suction wound catheter was placed. Drainage of the seroma successfully relieved its compressive effects on the spinal cord and the patient's neurological status improved. CT was a valuable tool in assessing spinal cord compression as a result of a postoperative subfascial seroma. Minimally invasive application of a wound catheter can be successfully used to manage this condition.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cervical Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seroma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Compression</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Outcome following surgery remains poorly described. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for surgical correction of grade 4 MPL. Signalment and exam findings, surgical procedures performed, complications, and clinical outcome were reported. Data was statistically analyzed for association with major complication occurrence and unacceptable function following surgery. Forty-seven stifles from 41 dogs were included. The surgical procedures most frequently utilized for patellar realignment were the combination of femoral trochleoplasty, tibial tuberosity transposition, and joint capsule modification. Median in-hospital veterinary examination was performed at 69 days (range 30-179 days) following surgery. Full function was reported for 42.6% of cases (n=20). Acceptable function was reported for 40.4% of cases (n=19). Unacceptable function was reported for 17% of cases (n=8). The overall complication rate was 25.5% (n=12), with revision surgery for major complications required in 12.8% of cases (n=6). Corrective osteotomies were associated with major complications (P &lt; 0.001). In general, pelvic limb function improves following surgical correction of grade 4 MPL; however, a return to full function should be considered guarded.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Patella</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Patellar Dislocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The vomiting is thought to result from a reflux of duodenal fluid into the gastric lumen causing mucosal irritation. Medical records from Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (CSUVTH) were searched for "canine" and "bilious vomiting syndrome" between 2002 and 2012. Visual inspection confirmed a diagnosis of BVS during the case history. The diagnosis remained BVS for the duration of the dog's contact with the hospital in 17 cases. Therapy involved frequent feedings, late evening meals, gastric acid reducers, prokinetics, and gastroprotectants. Twelve dogs improved with therapy. Five dogs did not improve or were lost to follow-up. The diagnosis of BVS was supplanted in three cases with gastric adenocarcinoma, dietary indiscretion, and hepatopathy. The patient most likely given a diagnosis of BVS would be a young, mixed-breed, castrated male dog with a chronic history of vomiting bile. Response to therapy suggests abnormal gastrointestinal motility, local gastritis, gastric pH, or stimulation of the emetic center may be important factors in BVS. Dogs diagnosed with BVS rarely received a diagnostic evaluation sufficient to qualify it as a diagnosis of exclusion.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bile</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syndrome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vomiting</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The owner attempted various antibiotic treatments without clinical improvement. A cystoscopic evaluation of the coelom was performed. The liver appeared dark red-to-brown presenting multifocal irregularly shaped white-to-tan and roughly round areas of discoloration on the capsular surface. An adult keeled box turtle (Pyxidea mouhotii), which died in the same facility at the same time, had similar hepatic lesions detected upon necropsy. From hepatic lesions, an antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli was isolated. Antibiotic treatment based on sensitivity testing led to a rapid resolution of the clinical signs in the Cuora trifasciata , with gain of appetite 4 days after the first antibiotic administration. A recheck cystoscopy demonstrated macroscopic resolution of hepatic lesions. This report demonstrates, to the best of the authors' knowledge, for the first time the clinical usefulness of cystoscopy for the diagnostic evaluation of the coelom of small chelonians. This minimally invasive technique is a valuable clinical tool in the medical approach to posthatchling chelonians.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Turtles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At B-mode ultrasound, 9 lesions involved the right adrenal gland, 14 the left, and 1 was bilateral. Each dog received a bolus of the contrast agent into the cephalic vein, immediately followed by a 5-mL saline flush. The first contrast enhancement of each adrenal lesion was evaluated qualitatively to assess the degree of enhancement and its distribution during the wash-in and wash-out phases, as well as the presence of non-vascularized areas and specific vascular patterns. Pathological diagnoses were determined in all dogs by histopathology or by cytology. Combining enhancement degree and vascularity resulted in the best predictive model, allowing CEUS to differentiate adrenocortical adenoma (n=10), adenocarcinoma (n=7), and pheochromocytoma (n=7) with an accuracy of 91.7% (P &lt; 0.001). Combining enhancement degree and vascularity, CEUS can discriminate malignant versus benign adrenal lesions with a sensitivity of 100.0%, a specificity of 80.0%, and an accuracy of 91.7% (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, results of this study confirm that CEUS is useful for differentiating between the different types of adrenal tumors in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Gland Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Contrast Media</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A retrospective search for dogs that had undergone a cystotomy from 6 to 24 mo prior to the study was performed, yielding 31 dogs included in the study. All dogs had the cystotomy closed using full thickness sutures. These dogs underwent an ultrasound of the urinary bladder to evaluate the mucosa at the incision site. Four (12.9%) of the 31 dogs had mucosal lesions consistent with a polypoid mass or masses. None of these four dogs had lesions solely at the previous cystotomy site. This study confirmed our hypothesis of no long-term evidence of mucosal lesions at the previous cystotomy site closed with full thickness sutures. Based on the results, the use of full thickness suture placement for the closure of the urinary bladder following cystotomy does not result in bladder mucosal changes. Other causes of mucosal changes, such as polypoid mass or masses, should be considered if identified on follow-up ultrasound evaluations following cystotomy procedures regardless of closure technique.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sutures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Arthroscopic findings and treatment remains poorly described. The objective of this study was to describe the arthroscopic findings and short-term outcome following arthroscopic treatment in toy and small breed dogs with FCP. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Arthroscopic findings were available from 13 elbows (12 dogs). Outcome data &#8805;4 wk postoperatively were available for nine elbows. Owner satisfaction scores were available for 10 elbows. Common preoperative findings included lameness, elbow pain, and imaging abnormalities consistent with FCP. Displaced FCP was the most common FCP lesion identified. Cartilage lesions at the medial coronoid process were identified in 92.3% of elbows (n = 12), with a median Outerbridge score of 4 (range 1-5). Concurrent cartilage lesions of the medial humeral condyle were identified in 76.9% of elbows (n = 10). Seven of nine elbows had full or acceptable function postoperatively. Median owner outcome satisfaction was 91% (range 10-100). FCP should be considered a cause of thoracic limb lameness in toy and small breed dogs. Arthroscopy can be safely and effectively used to diagnose and treat FCP in these breeds.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthroscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joints</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>27259020</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>2016 AAHA Oncology Guidelines for Dogs and Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>All companion animal practices will be presented with oncology cases on a regular basis, making diagnosis and treatment of cancer an essential part of comprehensive primary care. Because each oncology case is medically unique, these guidelines recommend a patient-specific approach consisting of the following components: diagnosis, staging, therapeutic intervention, provisions for patient and personnel safety in handling chemotherapy agents, referral to an oncology specialty practice when appropriate, and a strong emphasis on client support. Determination of tumor type by histologic examination of a biopsy sample should be the basis for all subsequent steps in oncology case management. Diagnostic staging determines the extent of local disease and presence or absence of regional or distant metastasis. The choice of therapeutic modalities is based on tumor type, histologic grade, and stage, and may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and adjunctive therapies, such as nutritional support and pain management. These guidelines discuss the strict safety precautions that should be observed in handling chemotherapy agents, which are now commonly used in veterinary oncology. Because cancer is often a disease of older pets, the time of life when the pet-owner relationship is usually strongest, a satisfying outcome for all parties involved is highly dependent on good communication between the entire healthcare team and the client, particularly when death or euthanasia of the patient is being considered. These guidelines include comprehensive tables of common canine and feline cancers as a resource for case management and a sample case history.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Management</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Practice Guidelines as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computer-assisted drawing and stereolithography was used to create instruments and implants that were evaluated by cadaver surgery. A trial, involving 26 client-owned dogs with lameness due to cranial cruciate ligament failure, was started. Follow-up was done by clinical and radiographic examination after 4 wk and clinical examination again 6-11 mo after surgery. The titanium foam implant maintained tibial tuberosity advancement easily and effectively. The same major complication occurred in 2 of the first 6 cases before, a slightly modified technique was used to treat 20 dogs without complication. At mid-term follow-up (6-11 mo), 20/26 dogs (77%) had returned to full function, two dogs (7.7%) had acceptable function, two dogs (7.7%) could not be evaluated due to recent contra lateral modified Maquet procedure surgery, and two (7.7%) dogs had died for reasons unrelated to the study. This is the first clinical report of the use of titanium foam in veterinary orthopaedics.

Overall distribution of histopathologic diagnosis and clinicopathologic features were evaluated for 325 dogs that met inclusion criteria. Dogs were dichotomized into two groups based on weight, with the statistically derived cutoff identified as 27.8 kg. Malignancy was diagnosed in 58% of dogs, with no difference between small (55%) and large (61%) dogs (P = .291). Overall, 32% of splenic masses were hemangiosarcoma (HSA), which comprised 25 and 39% of all masses in small and large dogs, respectively. The diagnosis of HSA, non-HSA malignancy, or benign splenic disease was significantly different between the groups (P = .019). Of malignant diagnoses, HSA comprised 46 and 65% of small and large dog splenic neoplasms, respectively (P = .009). In both groups, dogs with HSA were significantly more likely to have preoperative anemia, hemoabdomen, thrombocytopenia, and a blood transfusion, as compared to dogs with non-HSA malignancy or benign lesions.

In 2008, the EPA requested that manufacturers phase out second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. In response, manufacturers began to increase production of bromethalin-based rodenticides. It is likely that pet exposure to bromethalin will increase in the future. Bromethalin has no known antidote and tends to deposit in fat. Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) are being used with increasing frequency in both human and veterinary medicine to treat numerous acute systemic toxicities. A 4 yr old spayed female Pit bull terrier was presented following witnessed ingestion of bromethalin rodenticide by the owners. Decontamination was unsuccessful and ILE was started. Serum was frozen at -80&#176;C before and 1 hr after completion of ILE. In rats, the half-life of desmethylbromethalin, the toxic metabolite, has been reported at 5.6 days and 6 days, and it is likely to be similar in dogs. The only intervention between the pre-lipid serum sample and the post-lipid serum sample was the administration of ILE, and the serum desmethylbromethalin levels were reduced by 75% (from 4 ppb to 1 ppb) during this time. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing treatment of bromethalin ingestion with ILE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aniline Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fat Emulsions, Intravenous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodenticides</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cervical computed tomography showed an approximately 10 cm, fluid-filled, multilobulated mass located on the ventrolateral right side of the cervical region extending into the thoracic inlet. Cytologic examination of the fluid revealed cystic fluid with evidence of chronic hemorrhage. The mass was surgically removed, and histopathologic examination revealed a thyroglossal duct carcinoma. Thyroid and parathyroid gland origin were ruled out by negative immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and synaptophysin. No adjunctive treatment was performed and no recurrence was noted at 14 mo. Thyroglossal duct carcinoma has not been previously reported in a cat.

Six dogs participated in a ball-retrieving protocol, and seven dogs participated in a sheep-herding protocol. Findings were compared with 16 normal border collies participating in the same exercise protocols (11 retrieving, five herding). Twelve dogs with BCC developed abnormal mentation and/or an abnormal gait during evaluation. All dogs had post-exercise elevations in rectal temperature, pulse rate, arterial blood pH, PaO2, and lactate, and decreased PaCO2 and bicarbonate, as expected with strenuous exercise, but there were no significant differences between BCC dogs and normal dogs. Electrocardiography demonstrated sinus tachycardia in all dogs following exercise. Needle electromyography was normal, and evaluation of muscle biopsy cryosections using a standard panel of histochemical stains and reactions did not reveal a reason for collapse in 10 dogs with BCC in which these tests were performed.

Proper treatment of a UTI is important with myelopathy because it is a risk factor for persistent infection and reinfection in dogs. The study authors' investigated the incidence of UTIs in dogs having received either cefovecin or cefazolin as a preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for thoracolumbar hemilaminectomy. Thirty-nine dogs were retrospectively identified and assigned to groups based on preoperative antibiotic administration and postoperative urinary tract management. Urinalysis and urine culture performed preoperatively, at 2 wk, and at 6 wk, were reviewed to determine the incidence of UTIs. Urinary tract management, grade of neurologic deficit, time to ambulation, and time to voluntary urination were identified to evaluate for additional risk factors. No significant prevalence of UTI incidence was appreciated between the cefovecin and cefazolin groups. Patients with higher grades of neurologic deficit and that took longer to regain ambulation and voluntary urination were at significantly greater risk for UTIs throughout the postoperative period. This study reemphasizes the importance of continued surveillance for UTIs in patients with prolonged neurologic recovery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cephalosporins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perioperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

These proliferations were identifiable via palpation. Radiographs showed a smooth, proliferative bony lesion of the distal femur (case 1) and tarsus (case 2) with mild soft tissue swelling. Surgical debulking with incomplete resection was performed in each cat. Subsequent histopathology resulted in a diagnosis of periosteal chondrosarcoma (PC). Although both cats have experienced local recurrence, both are still alive more than 2.5 yr after mass debulking. Periosteal chondrosarcoma is a differential diagnosis in proliferative cortical bony lesions near an articular surface in older cats. Partial resection of these masses can lead to an excellent quality of life, and proper diagnosis can avoid amputation or even euthanasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chondrosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Periosteum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clipper blades have been confirmed as fomites for numerous potential pathogens and, as such, may be associated with wound and surgical site infections. The goal of this study was to evaluate the disinfectant capabilities of several commonly used clipper blade cleaning products. Seventy sterile clipper blades were inoculated with strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus aureus . Blades were then subjected to one of seven treatment groups for disinfecting. Quantitative cultures of remaining bacteria were performed. All blades in the control group showed large amounts of bacterial recovery. Culture results showed no recovery in blades soaked in alcohol or chlorhexidine or those sprayed with an ethanol/o-phenylphenol product, while moderate recovery was seen with all other treatments. These results show that persistent contamination of clipper blades can occur with the use of several commonly used disinfectant products. Further research is necessary to evaluate fungicidal capabilities as well as the effect of disinfection on clipper blade maintenance.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disinfectants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disinfection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equipment Contamination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The initial step when presented with a vomiting patient is to differentiate between vomiting and regurgitation or dysphagia. There are numerous causes for chronic vomiting in cats, and therefore a detailed and comprehensive patient history and a systematic diagnostic approach are key steps in determining the cause for vomiting and the most appropriate treatment plan. Common causes for chronic vomiting in cats may include inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy, gastrointestinal motility disorders, neoplasia, and extra-gastrointestinal diseases, such as renal disease, hepatobiliary disease, and hyperthyroidism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vomiting</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The present article describes three cases of strangury, abdominal pain, and anorexia associated with seminal vesiculitis in pet rabbits. Three non-neutered male pet rabbits aged 3.6, 1.5, and 2.1 yrs were presented with strangury, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Seminal vesiculitis was diagnosed based on clinical signs and ultrasonography findings. Vesiculectomy was performed in two cases that presented strangury refractory to medical treatment, and diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. In the third case, the patient received medical treatment, and a sequela in the form of lithiasis of the seminal vesicle was detected 3 yrs later. Plain radiographs were nearly unremarkable, and results from complete blood analysis and urinalysis were not specific in all three cases. Contrast radiography was performed in one case, showing a dilated seminal vesicle. Ultrasound and surgical biopsy seem to be the most sensitive techniques in the diagnosis of this pathology. Seminal vesiculitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of acute or chronic strangury in male pet rabbits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluoroquinolones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genital Diseases, Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orchiectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabbits</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Seminal Vesicles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The lesion was identified using computed tomography and ultrasonography and confirmed as sarcoma on histopathological analysis of incisional biopsies. Clinical signs dramatically improved following surgical biopsy before recurring three months later. Repeat epineurotomy of the deep branch of the radial nerve resulted in clinical improvement for a further month before signs once again returned.

This report describes three dogs with acute onset dyspnea due to hemorrhagic pleural effusion resulting from intrathoracic extracardiac masses, which were confirmed as HSA by histopathology. The dogs were stabilized with thoracocentesis and intravascular fluid resuscitation. Computed tomography identified intrathoracic masses, which were not originating from the heart or pulmonary parenchyma. Surgical exploration was performed in all cases. Case 1 was euthanized intraoperatively as the tumor could not be dissected from the aorta. In cases 2 and 3, hemostasis and resection of the tumors was successful. Case 2 was euthanized 1 mo after surgery and case 3 was alive at the time of writing, 5 mo postoperatively. Intrathoracic extracardiac HSA should be considered as a differential for nontraumatic hemothorax and surgical treatment can be palliative.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemothorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vascular Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Spirometers continuously measure volume, airway pressure, and flow while calculating and continuously displaying respiratory system compliance and resistance in the form of loops. The aim of this case series is to show how observation of spirometric loops, similar to electrocardiogram or CO2 curve monitoring, can improve safety of anesthetic management in small animals. Spirometric monitoring cases described in this case series are based on use of the anaesthesia monitor Capnomac Ultima with a side stream spirometry sensor. The cases illustrate how recognition and understanding of spirometric loops allows for easy diagnosis of iatrogenic pneumothorax, incorrect ventilator settings, leaks in the system, kinked or partially obstructed endotracheal tube, and spontaneous breathing interfering with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. The case series demonstrates the potential of spirometry to improve the quality and safety of anesthetic management, and, hence, its use can be recommended during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and procedures in which interference with ventilation can be expected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiration, Artificial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spirometry</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ophthalmic examination revealed multiple linear foreign bodies throughout the adnexal tissue and cornea of the left eye. Manual removal of material was unsuccessful. The palpebral conjunctiva required excision with tenotomy scissors to remove structures and allow corneal healing. Microscopic examination revealed structures believed to be setae from a Theraphosidae tarantula. This was confirmed morphologically by an entomologist and by comparison with hairs from a captive spider of the suspected species. The excised tissue also contained fruiting bodies, hyphae, and microconidia consistent with Aspergillus spp. The captive spider hairs also cultured positive for Aspergillus, suggesting a relationship between this fungus and tarantulas in captivity and in their native habitat. This is the first report in the veterinary literature to confirm tarantula hair as the causative agent in keratoconjunctivitis and corneal ulceration, adding it to the list of differential diagnoses for ocular foreign body. This is also the first report to suggest a relationship between Aspergillus and tarantulas of the Theraphosidae family, which should be considered in the diagnostics and treatment of patients with suspected tarantula hair keratoconjunctivitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corneal Ulcer</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eye Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hair</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Keratoconjunctivitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Miconazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spiders</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This report describes temporary rectal stenting in two dogs following severe perineal wounds. Dog 1 presented with a 4 &#215; 4 cm full-thickness perineal slough secondary to multiple rectal perforations. A 12 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube was placed per-rectum as a temporary stent to minimize fecal contamination. The stent was removed 18 days after placement, and the perineal wound had healed at 32 days post-stent placement, when a minor rectal stricture associated with mild, intermittent tenesmus was detected. Long-term outcome was deemed good. Dog 2 presented with multiple necrotic wounds with myiasis, circumferentially surrounding the anus and extending along the tail. A 14 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube was placed per-rectum. The perineal and tail wounds were managed with surgical debridement and wet-to-dry and honey dressings prior to caudectomy and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Delayed secondary wound closure and stent removal were performed on day six without complication. Long-term outcome was deemed excellent. Temporary rectal stenting may be a useful technique for fecal diversion to facilitate resolution of complex perineal injuries, including rectal perforation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perineum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rectum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wounds and Injuries</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Unremarkable veterinary evaluation and lack of disease progression over time made common systemic, cardiac, and neurologic causes of exercise intolerance unlikely. Survey questions addressed signalment, age of onset, description of episodes, and owner perception of factors associated with collapse. Most dogs were young adults (median 2 yr) when episodes began, and they had experienced from 2 to more than 100 episodes (median 6) prior to their owners completing the survey. Retrieving was the activity most commonly associated with episodes (112/165 dogs, 68%), followed by herding stock (39/165 dogs, 24%). Owners reported that high environmental temperatures (111/165 dogs, 67%) and excitement (67/165 dogs, 41%) increased the likelihood of their dog having an episode during strenuous activity. Veterinary evaluation of videotapes of presumed border collie collapse (BCC) episodes (40 dogs) were used to provide a description of the typical features of BCC episodes. Altered mentation, symmetrical ataxia affecting all four limbs, increased pelvic limb extensor tone and toe scuffing or knuckling, truncal swaying, and falling to the side were common features, suggesting that BCC may be an episodic diffuse central nervous system disorder.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gait</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Conditioning, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Video Recording</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

EOL care should focus on maximizing patient comfort and minimizing suffering while providing a collaborative and supportive partnership with the caregiver client. Timely, empathetic, and nonjudgmental communication is the hallmark of effective client support. Veterinarians should not allow an EOL patient to succumb to a natural death without considering the option of euthanasia and ensuring that other measures to alleviate discomfort and distress are in place. Animal hospice care addresses the patient's unique emotional and social needs as well as the physical needs traditionally treated in clinical practice. An EOL treatment plan should consist of client education; evaluating the caregiver's needs and goals for the pet; and a collaborative, personalized, written treatment plan involving the clinical staff and client. Primary care practices should have a dedicated team to implement palliative and hospice care for EOL patients. How the healthcare team responds to a client's grief after the loss of a pet can be a key factor in the client's continued loyalty to the practice. Referral to professional grief-support counseling can be a helpful option in this regard.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bioethics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Euthanasia, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospice Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Human-Animal Bond</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Management</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palliative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Practice Guidelines as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Societies, Scientific</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In order to evaluate the effect of two different preoperative fasting times on the incidence of GER during general anesthesia, 120 dogs were randomly assigned to two groups: administration of canned food 3 h before premedication (group C3, n = 60) and administration of canned food 10 h before premedication (group C10, n = 60). The animals were premedicated with propionyl-promazine. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium and maintained with halothane. A pH electrode was introduced into the esophagus, and the esophageal pH was constantly monitored. Esophageal pH of less than 4 or greater than 7.5 was taken as an indication of GER. Three of the 60 dogs of group C3 and 12 of the 60 dogs of group C10 experienced a GER episode, the difference being statistically significant (P = .025). Feeding the dog 3 h before anesthesia at a half daily rate reduces significantly the incidence of GER during anesthesia, compared to the administration of the same amount and type of food 10 h before anesthesia. The administration of a half daily dose of an ordinary canine diet may be useful in clinical practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastroesophageal Reflux</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Preoperative Period</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

At referral, the dog was diagnosed initially with typical hypoadrenocorticism, and 2 d later, concurrent primary hypothyroidism was detected. Hormonal replacement therapies, including fludrocortisone, prednisolone, and levothyroxine, were initiated, but a few days later the dog became abruptly tachypneic, and thoracic radiographs indicated the development of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography showed that there were abnormalities indicating impaired left ventricular function, although the heart valves were normal. Following treatment with pimobendan and furosemide, the pulmonary edema resolved. The dog had no recurrence of the clinical signs after 10 mo of follow-up, despite being off all cardiac medications; consequently, the cardiac failure was transient or reversible in this dog.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical features of DCM in standard schnauzers. Medical records for 15 standard schnauzers diagnosed with DCM were reviewed. The median age at diagnosis of DCM was 1.6 yr, with all dogs developing left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF). The median age of onset of CHF was 1.6 yr, and was significantly shorter in males (1.5 yr) than for females (2.35 yr). The median survival time after diagnosis of CHF was 22 days, and was shorter in males (13 days) than females (62 days). The occurrence of early onset DCM in multiple closely related standard schnauzers suggests a familial predisposition in this breed.

To investigate this, 20 dogs presenting for elective correction of brachycephalic airway syndrome (cases) and 20 non-brachycephalic dogs (controls) undergoing other elective surgeries were prospectively enrolled. Dogs underwent a standardized anesthetic protocol, and esophageal pH was monitored. Signalment, body weight, historical gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, complete blood count, serum biochemical values, radiographic findings, and anesthetic and surgical time were compared between cases and controls, and dogs that did and did not have basic (pH &gt; 7.5), acidic (pH &lt; 4), or any GER. Controls had higher mean esophageal pH (6.3) compared to cases (5.6, P = .019), but there was no difference in % with GER (cases 60%, controls 40%, P = .34). When all dogs were evaluated, dogs with GER had increased creatinine (P = .01), % positive for esophageal fluid on radiographs (P = .05), and body weight (P = .04) compared to those without GER.

The dog was initially presented for positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) as full-body staging following amputation and adjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of OSA of the proximal tibia. The initial PET/CT did not show evidence of metastatic disease. Six mo after OSA, diagnosis pulmonary metastatic nodules were identified and oral toceranib phosphate was initiated. Twelve mo postdiagnosis the dog developed neck pain and non-ambulatory tetraparesis and was diagnosed with a C7 vertebral metastatic lesion based on magnetic resonance imaging. A second PET/CT was performed to screen for further metastatic lesions, and a nodule within the right ischium was identified. The C7 and ischial lesions were treated with stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT). Sixteen mo postdiagnosis, a third PET/CT was performed due to increasing size of the pulmonary nodules and a right-sided liver metastasis was detected. The liver mass was treated with SRT. The PET/CT scans facilitated identification of gross metastatic lesions that were subsequently treated with SRT, which resulted in clinical improvement of the dog's neurological signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Positron-Emission Tomography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiosurgery</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, with some exceptions, there are very few reports of thromboembolism in such dogs. This multicentre retrospective observational study describes a case series of thromboembolism (TE) in eight dogs with PLE secondary to non-neoplastic, chronic small intestinal disease. Seven dogs had poorly controlled PLE when the thromboembolic event occurred. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) occurred in six dogs, while one dog developed splenic vein thrombosis and another had concurrent splenic vein and aortic TE. Six dogs died, all with PTE. Antithrombin activity was decreased in one of two dogs in which it was measured. Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations were measured in three dogs and cobalamin was subnormal in all three. Serum magnesium, measured in two dogs, was low in both. Dogs with uncontrolled chronic small intestinal disease and PLE are at risk for developing serious life-threatening TE, mostly PTE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestine, Small</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Observational Studies as Topic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protein-Losing Enteropathies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thromboembolism</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Bleomycin is an antitumor antibiotic with a minimal adverse event profile; though commonly used for human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, its use is poorly characterized in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective case series was to describe the clinical response and adverse event profile of systemic bleomycin for canine multicentric lymphoma (n = 10). A partial response was noted in one dog that died 24 days later due to unrelated disease. Adverse events were infrequent and limited to grade 1 gastrointestinal and grade 1 constitutional toxicity. Although clinical response was minimal, systemic bleomycin was well tolerated when administered at 0.5 U/kg. Additional studies are warranted to determine the influence of administration schedule and dose on the efficacy of bleomycin for veterinary neoplasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antibiotics, Antineoplastic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bleomycin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The technique was performed using an aiming device in all four elbow joints and assisted by intraoperative fluoroscopy in one. All screws were successfully placed on first attempt and no elbow joint required repositioning of the transcondylar screw. On immediate postoperative radiographs, median transcondylar screw angulation was 2.9&#176; and median percentage of screw eccentricity relative to the theoretical center of the humeral condyle was 14%. No short-term postoperative complications (&lt;1 mo) were observed. The surgical technique described is a feasible option for surgical management of incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle in dogs that allowed accurate transcondylar screw placement and orientation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Screws</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Forelimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteogenesis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Early enteral nutrition (EEN) in critically ill humans can lead to improved outcome. This study was performed to determine the safety of early postoperative feeding in canine septic peritonitis. In this retrospective case series, 56 dogs were identified. Sixteen dogs received EEN, defined as nutrition within 24 hr of surgery; 27 received late enteral nutrition (LEN) defined as nutrition more than 24 hours following surgery; and 13 dogs had no enteral nutrition in hospital (NEN). Signalment, physical examination findings, and occurrence of pre-admission vomiting, regurgitation, and length of anorexia were the same amongst all groups. There was no significant difference in the number of gastrointestinal complications postoperatively between the EEN, LEN, and NEN groups or in the occurrence of vomiting/regurgitation postoperatively compared to preoperatively. There was no difference in the length of hospitalization between any group, although fewer dogs in the NEN group survived compared to the EEN/LEN combined group (46% [6/13] versus 81% [37/40]). This study indicates it is safe to initiate EEN without additional risk of gastrointestinal complications. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the potential benefits of EEN in dogs with septic peritonitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Administration Schedule</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enteral Nutrition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records review identified azotemic and non-azotemic cats prescribed benazepril. Blood pressure was recorded at the first available time after initiation of therapy. No cats experienced documented systolic systemic hypotension (&lt;90 mmHg). Serum creatinine, and potassium when available, were recorded at baseline and in time windows after initiation of treatment: 1-30 days and 31-60 days. Blood chemistry results were screened for hyperkalemia (&#8805;6.0 mEq/L). During the first 2 mo after starting benazepril therapy, there was a low incidence (3.7%) and clinically insignificant magnitude of hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine increases of greater than 30% from baseline were noted. This change was found in 11.0% of cats during the first 30 days of therapy and in 13.7% of cats from days 31-60 after initiation of therapy. The long-term survival of the cats that had &gt;30% increases in creatinine from baseline was not statistically different from the survival of those that did not experience these increases, which suggests this finding may not be a reason to discontinue therapy. Benazepril appeared safe in a heterogeneous population of cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antihypertensive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Benzazepines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertension</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Renal Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Antidiarrheic therapy was previously administered without success and inflammatory bowel disease localized to the small intestine was suspected, given the chronic clinical signs and by ruling out other known causes of gastrointestinal inflammation. Endoscopic biopsy of duodenum showed a moderate increase in lamina propria lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Basophilic bodies were seen in the cytoplasm of numerous macrophages, suggestive of Leishmania spp, confirmed by immunostaining, and a diagnosis of granulomatous duodenitis associated to Leishmania infection was made. After 7 mo of therapy, a significant clinical improvement and weight gain were observed, and endoscopic histology showed no evidence of Leishmania. A progressive decline of anti-leishmanial antibody titer was also observed during follow-up. This report emphasizes the importance of atypical symptoms and the unusual location of visceral leishmaniasis, suggesting the need to consider leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis of canine chronic enteritis, especially in endemic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Allopurinol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Therapy, Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Duodenitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmaniasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meglumine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meglumine Antimoniate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organometallic Compounds</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

History included weight loss, increased activity and appetite, gagging, and occasional diarrhea. Exam findings included a body condition score of 4/9 and palpable ventral cervical nodules. A serum thyroxine (T4) value was 8.0 ug/dL (normal = 0.8-3.5ug/dL). Doppler systolic blood pressure readings ranged from 200-210 mmHg (normal systolic blood pressure &lt;150 mmHg). The diagnosis was hyperthyroidism due to active thyroid masses. Due to financial constraints, the owner elected conservative management. Initial treatment with methimazole resulted in a decreased T4 value of 5.0 ug/dL at approximately 4 mo after initiation of treatment. A commercially available iodine-restricted feline diet was fed and this resulted in further reduction in serum T4 levels, improved sleeping cycles, reduced anxiety, and reduced systolic blood pressure. A temporary suspension of iodine-restricted feline diet for 2 mo resulted in increases in serum T4 concentrations, which, subsequently, decreased with re-introduction of the diet. Roughly 10 mo after initiation of the therapeutic diet and 16 mo after intial diagnosis, the dog remains relatively normal clinically despite active growing cervical masses with T4 concentration of 2.3 ug/dL.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amlodipine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertension</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperthyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methimazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trazodone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Fifty-one normal dachshunds had radiographs and an echocardiogram performed. Five observers measured VHS to the nearest 0.25 vertebra. The data was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, calculation of reference and confidence intervals, Spearman rank-order correlations, and generation of intra-class correlations and confidence intervals. P &lt; .05 was considered significant. The median for right lateral VHS was significantly larger than left (10.3 [range 9.25-11.55] versus 10.1 [range, 8.7-11.31], p &lt; .0001). VHS for females was significantly larger than for males (left: 10.56 [9.2-11.31] versus 9.74 [8.7-10.88] and right: 10.8 [9.5-11.55] versus 9.99 [9.25-10.8], p = .0002). Observer consistency was high with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.95. No significant correlation was found between left atrial echocardiographic parameters and VHS. Results indicate normal dachshunds have a median VHS above the published generic canine reference range, and VHS can be reliably performed by observers with varying degrees of clinical experience.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography, Thoracic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reference Values</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracic Vertebrae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28282235</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Artifacts During Short-Term Interictal Electroencephalographic Recording in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>The electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrodiagnostic technique widely used in both scientific research and clinical medicine. It makes it possible to study the neurophysiology of brain activity by recording real-time changes in electrical potential produced by cortical activation. The importance of EEG in diagnosing canine epilepsy demonstrates its usefulness when the owner's description of crises is not clear or when the episodes cannot be differentiated from behavioral or cardiac disorders. However, EEG recordings also often record electrical activity from sources other than the brain, which may interfere with the clinical event-related signal. This activity is known as artifactual electrical activity, and the signal changes recorded in these cases corrupt the trace when they are superimposed on brain activity or even, in some cases, mimic pathologic abnormalities. The first step in analyzing and interpreting EEG traces is to recognize artifacts and other specific transient events. This retrospective study set out to ascertain whether artifacts comparable to those described in humans are observed in protocols used to perform short-term interictal EEG for canine epilepsy and how these can be classified.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Artifacts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroencephalography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epilepsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Observer Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eighteen adult hounds were heavily sedated with IV morphine (0.2 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine to undergo thoracic skin incisions. After reversal, dogs were randomly assigned to receive loading doses of lidocaine and ketamine (MLK), lidocaine and saline (ML), or equivalent volume of saline (M), followed by 18 hr constant infusions of morphine (0.12 mg/kg/hr), lidocaine (3 mg/kg/hr) and ketamine (0.6 mg/kg/hr); morphine (0.12 mg/kg/hr) and lidocaine (3 mg/kg/hr); or morphine (0.12 mg/kg/hr), respectively. Pain was assessed with Short Form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale and mechanical nociception with von Frey filaments (VFFS). Data were analyzed with linear mixed model on ranks. Independently of treatment, Short Form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale was significantly higher than baseline for 24 hr (p &lt; .0001), while VFFS was significantly lower than baseline for 48 hr post-recovery (p &lt; .0001), with no difference between MLK and M groups.

Fourteen client-owned dogs with confirmed cycad palm ingestion were identified by reviewing the medical record database at Gulf Coast Veterinary Specialists. Information on signalment, time of ingestion to presentation, clinical signs, physical examination findings, initial and peak/nadir laboratory abnormalities, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, treatment modalities, liver histopathology, and clinical outcome was retrieved. Of the 14 dogs, nine (64%) died as a direct result of cycad palm intoxication, and three survivors had persistently elevated liver enzymes, signifying residual liver damage. Despite decontamination, patients continued to display evidence of illness, indicating rapid absorption of toxins. When evaluating initial and peak/nadir laboratory values, nadir serum albumin levels and nadir platelet counts were significantly lower in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (1.25 g/dL [0.4-2.1 g/dL] versus 2.6 g/dL [1.7-3.4 g/dL] and 21 &#215; 10[3] [0-64 &#215; 10[3]] versus 62 &#215; 10[3] [6-144 &#215; 10[3]], respectively).

Seventeen dogs were evaluated with 10 meeting inclusion criteria for this study. Evaluations included orthopedic exam, visual lameness scoring, Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI), goniometry, kinetic gait analysis, and radiography. Initial lameness score, age, body weight, duration of lameness, and CBPI scores did not differ between groups. Change in CBPI pain severity score in the prolotherapy group from wk 6-12 was significantly less improved than in the placebo group, with no other significant differences in pain severity or pain interference scores between groups. Range of motion and radiographic scores did not differ between groups at any time. Mean kinetic forces improved in prolotherapy dogs but were not significantly different between treatment groups at any time. Although easily performed and well-tolerated, there were no statistically significant benefits of dextrose prolotherapy for treatment of osteoarthritis of the elbow and stifle in dogs. Post hoc power analysis of these sample means and standard deviations found that 29-106 animals per group would be necessary to demonstrate significant differences in kinetic forces, providing useful guidance for future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Double-Blind Method</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intra-Articular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Measurement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Weight-Bearing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of epilepsy in dogs on their owners, utilizing an online survey tool. A questionnaire was developed to explore a variety of factors, including seizure history, treatment, outcome, quality of life, costs associated with therapy, and sources of support. A total of 225 responses were obtained. The majority of respondents reported positive scores for overall quality of life, although scores were significantly lower for dogs with poorly controlled epilepsy and medication-related adverse effects. The median monthly expenditure for antiepileptic medication was $51-75. Despite the considerable financial burden placed on the dog owner, monthly medication cost was not associated with quality of life score. Few published reports follow dogs with epilepsy after diagnosis, and there is a growing need to understand the issues associated with long-term management of this population. The results of this study provide useful information that can help veterinary professionals educate owners and set expectations regarding treatment of seizures and quality of life for dogs with epilepsy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anticonvulsants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Caregivers</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epilepsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28291398</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Periodontal Therapy in Dogs Using Bone Augmentation Products Marketed for Veterinary Use.</Title>	<Abstract>Periodontal disease is extremely common in companion animal practice. Patients presenting for a routine oral examination and prophylaxis may be found to have extensive periodontal disease and attachment loss. Vertical bone loss is a known sequela to periodontal disease and commonly involves the distal root of the mandibular first molar. This case report outlines two dogs presenting for oral examination and prophylaxis with general anesthesia. Both patients did not have any clinical symptoms of periodontal disease other than halitosis. Both patients were diagnosed with three-walled vertical bone loss defects of one or both mandibular first molars utilizing dental radiography as well as periodontal probing, measuring, and direct visual inspection. These defects were consistent with periodontal disease index stage 4 (&gt;50% attachment loss). The lesions were treated with appropriate root planing and debridement.

Laryngoscopic exam revealed diffuse, severe edema and static displacement of redundant glossoepiglottic (GE) mucosa causing complete obstruction of the larynx and epiglottic entrapment. Static displacement of the GE mucosa was observed and determined to be the overriding component of dyspnea in this patient with BOAS. Resection and primary closure with two separate, simple continuous sutures of the GE mucosa were performed. Resection and primary closure of the GE mucosa resolved the acute onset of dyspnea in this patient. Surgical correction of the stenotic nares, elongated soft palate, and everted laryngeal saccules were performed under the same anesthetic procedure. Static displacement of the GE mucosa may occur in patients with BOAS. Surgical resection and closure of the GE mucosa resolved this patient's dyspnea and is recommended in airway obstruction. It remains to be determined if primary closure and subsequent tensioning or scar tissue of the GE mucosa results in further complications related to restricted epiglottic movement.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epiglottis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laryngeal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Respiratory Mucosa</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Measurements were obtained on lateral radiographs before and after stenting to determine percent of the trachea occupied by the stent. These values were monitored over time and compared to complication rates and survival. Overall median survival time was 502 days. Six month survival rate was 78%, 1 yr survival was 60%, and 2 yr survival was 26%. Median percent of trachea occupied by the stent at initial placement was 79% (range, 41-93%). Percent of the trachea occupied by the stent at the time of placement did not significantly correlate to complication rate (0.397) or survival time (0.853). Incidence of serious complications was 37%, including granuloma formation, pneumonia, material failure, and stent migration. For patients experiencing serious complications, median survival was shorter, at 208 days, but was not significantly different from survival without serious complications. Within the margins of the data from this study, the proportion of the trachea occupied by the stent at the time of placement does not appear to impact incidence of complications or survival time in dogs with tracheal collapse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tracheal Stenosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Specifically, distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded from 34 puppies (both sexes) of a variety of breeds, from 6-10 wk of age, and the results were compared to brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) recorded from the same puppies. Recordings were obtained from both ears in awake or lightly anesthetized puppies, and the results from each ear were compared. In all 62 ears that had normal BAERs, the distortion product otoacoustic emissions screener gave a response of "Pass." The three puppies that had flat BAER recordings in one or both ears provided a screener result of "Refer." In two ears with unusual BAERs (waveforms with reduced amplitudes and prolonged latencies) and a "Refer" response from the screener, there was compacted debris in one external ear canal, and the other ear canal was normal. The screener technology has proven application in human infants and is an attractive alternative to BAER testing in puppies because of expense and ease of use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Deafness</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hearing Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Studies have examined slide evaluation techniques, ear swab cytology staining methods, and observer variations; few studies compare common clinical sampling techniques. The primary aim of this study was to measure detection of microorganisms and neutrophils by impression smear compared to acetate tape preparation; comparison of agreement between two acetate tape staining methods was a secondary aim. Thirty lesions consistent with superficial pyoderma were sampled via impression smear and acetate tape preparation. Acetate tape preparations were either stained with modified Romanowksy stain solutions two and three or solution three alone. Impression smears were stained in the standard manner. Bacteria, yeast, and neutrophils were evaluated using a semi-quantitative scale [0-4]. Quantities were aggregated and compared using Cohen's kappa to measure agreement between methods. When impression smears were compared to acetate tape, the lowest agreement occurred for neutrophils, with impression smears detecting more neutrophils. Comparison of acetate tape staining methods had the highest agreement for yeast detection. Sampling technique and staining method did not differ for detection of bacteria. Impression smears detected more neutrophils, and yeast detection appeared equivalent for acetate tape staining methods.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ear Canal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Observer Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Specimen Handling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staining and Labeling</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

All dogs had radiographic findings of soft tissue opacity in the area of the pharynx, larynx, or trachea, and several had narrowing of the tracheal lumen. Coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) were present in the four dogs that underwent testing. Four of five dogs were treated for the coagulopathy, presumably due to anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis, and survived to discharge.Upper airway obstruction is an unusual presentation for anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis in dogs.

Nine days after the last dose of cyclophosphamide (day +9), the dog was evaluated at Perth Veterinary Specialists. Physical examination revealed mucosal pallor, a grade 2/6 systolic heart murmur, and severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Severe nonregenerative pancytopenia was detected on hematology. Broad spectrum antibiotics, two fresh whole blood transfusions, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and tranexamic acid were administered. Five days after presentation (day +14), the peripheral neutrophil count had recovered, and by 12 days (day +21) the complete blood count was near normal. A second episode of thrombocytopenia (day +51) was managed with vincristine, prednisolone, and melatonin. The dog made a complete recovery with no long-term complications at the time of writing.

Esophageal dilatation and severe diffuse proliferative lesions of the esophageal mucosa were found via radiography and esophagoscopy, respectively. Histopathologic examination revealed severe, chronic, diffuse, hyperplastic eosinophilic and mastocytic esophagitis. Eosinophilic infiltrates were prominent, with a mean of 29.8 eosinophils per high power field, supportive of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Significant clinical improvement was seen with dietary modification using a hydrolyzed diet. The addition of glucocorticoids did not result in further improvement in clinical signs. Repeat histopathology showed near resolution of eosinophilic infiltration. EoE is an uncommon and rarely reported condition in dogs and cats. Diagnosis involves histopathologic confirmation and exclusion of other causes of eosinophilic infiltration within the esophagus. This case report demonstrates the importance of biopsy in identification of EoE and the efficacy of dietary modification in the treatment of this disease in a kitten.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eosinophilic Esophagitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glucocorticoids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Anxiety about anesthetizing dogs with heart disease is a common cause of referral to specialty centers. To begin to address the potential effect of heart disease on anesthetic complications in dogs undergoing anesthesia for routine dental procedures, we compared anesthetic complications in 100 dogs with heart disease severe enough to trigger referral to a specialty center (cases) to those found in 100 dogs without cardiac disease (controls) that underwent similar procedures at the same teaching hospital. Medical records were reviewed to evaluate the occurrence of anesthetic complications. No dogs died in either group, and no significant differences were found between the groups in any of the anesthetic complications evaluated, although dogs in the heart disease group were significantly older with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. Midazolam and etomidate were used more frequently, and alpha-2 agonists used less frequently, in the heart disease group compared to controls. This study suggests dogs with heart disease, when anesthetized by trained personnel and carefully monitored during routine dental procedures, are not at significantly increased risk for anesthetic complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dental Prophylaxis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intraoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Oropharyngeal foreign objects are an uncommon but potentially serious disease that can lead to chronic abscessation and pain. Two dogs were presented with chronic complaints, including pain and inability to fully open the mouth for a 1 yr and 5 mo duration, respectively. There was no history or evidence of skin sinus or submandibular/cervical swelling on physical examination of either dog. Both dogs had normal oropharyngeal anatomy with the exception of an asymmetric contrast-enhancing lesion within the pterygoid muscle on CT imaging. As there were no gross abnormalities visible during surgery, the use of contrast CT was vital in order to isolate the focus of infection. A paramedian submandibular approach was used to explore this region, and in both cases, foreign material was successfully removed with subsequent resolution of clinical signs. The dogs were immediately free of clinical signs and showed no recurrence for at least 8 and 17 mo after the exploration, respectively. A novel surgical approach is described to remove oropharyngeal foreign objects and necrotic debris within the pterygoid muscle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pterygoid Muscles</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Canine cadaver larynges were used. A unilateral arytenoid lateralization (UAL) was performed with low or high suture tension and with the CA joint preserved or disarticulated. Rima glottidis area was measured with the epiglottis in an open and closed position. Results indicated that RG area was increased over baseline when UAL was performed with both low and high suture tension when the epiglottis was in an open position. High suture tension resulted in a greater increase in RG area compared to low suture tension, both when the CA was preserved and disarticulated. There was no difference in RG area when the CA was disarticulated versus preserved at either suture tension. Rima glottidis area was not significantly increased over baseline when the epiglottis was in a closed position except in the group with CA joint preservation and high suture tension. Although this study suggests that UAL can be performed with or without CA disarticulation, further studies are warranted before UAL without CA disarticulation can be recommended clinically.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arytenoid Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cricoid Cartilage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epiglottis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Anchors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Techniques</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The few existing reports evaluating the efficacy of medical therapy in controlling USMI in males have demonstrated limited success. In this case series, we report the effect of testosterone cypionate, given at a median dose of 1.5 mg/kg intramuscularly every 4 wk, in eight male dogs with USMI. Response was evaluated through the review of medical records and telephone interviews with the clients. Based on owners' assessments, a good to excellent response was reported in three of eight dogs (38%), a slight response was reported in one of eight dogs (12%), and a poor response was reported in four of eight dogs (50%). Adverse effects were not reported, and benefit was judged sufficient to continue therapy in two cases. The results reported in this case series suggest that testosterone cypionate might be an effective and safe treatment option for male dogs with USMI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Testosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed initially of the thoracolumbar vertebral column and was followed by MRI sequences of the brain for confirmation of the presence of a primary intracranial tumor.

Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of a primary choroid plexus carcinoma, with diffuse metastatic lesions to the spinal cord. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of MRI findings of spinal cord metastasis of a choroid plexus carcinoma in a dog. Additionally, this case demonstrates primary clinical signs arising from metastatic lesions.

Echocardiography revealed a fluid-filled structure and parts of the liver in the pericardial cavity. Computed tomography confirmed the existence of the PPDH and the herniation of the right medial liver lobe and the gallbladder. Cystic masses were observed in the pericardial and the peritoneal cavities, possibly communicating through the PPDH. A median laparotomy revealed a single lobulated cystic lesion extending into both the pericardial and peritoneal cavities through the PPDH. Because of the nonviable aspect of some parts of the liver parenchyma, the gallbladder was dissected from the fossa, and the central division of the liver was resected. A cholecystopexy was performed on the diaphragm to limit gallbladder mobility. The PPDH was closed in the standard fashion. Histopathology of the cystic structure was compatible with a pericardial pseudocyst. Two months postoperatively, the dog was healthy, and the results of blood biochemistry and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. A pericardial pseudocyst can be associated with a PPDH in young dogs. Moreover, cholecystopexy appears to be a safe and effective method of limiting gallbladder mobility after resection of the central hepatic division.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biliary Tract Surgical Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diaphragm</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gallbladder</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Cyst</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pericardium</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The study purpose was to retrospectively compare mitotic index, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs)/nucleus, Ki-67 index, KIT labeling pattern, and internal tandem duplication mutations in c-KIT between stage I and stage II grade II MCTs. Medical records and tumor biopsy samples from dogs with Grade II MCTs with cytological or histopathological regional lymph node evaluation were included. Signalment, tumor location and stage, and presence of a recurrent versus de novo tumor were recorded. Mitotic index, AgNORs/nucleus, Ki-67, KIT staining pattern, and internal tandem duplication mutations in exon 11 of c-KIT were evaluated. Sixty-six tumors (51 stage I; 15 stage II) were included. Only AgNORs/nucleus and recurrent tumors were significantly associated with stage (odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.0, P = .049; odds ratio 8.8, 95% CI 1.1-69.5; P = .039). Receiver-operator characteristic analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of AgNORs/cell &#8805; 1.87 were 93.3% and 27.4%, respectively, (area under the curve: 0.65) for predicting stage. Recurrent tumors and higher AgNORs/nucleus are associated with stage II grade II MCTs; however, an AgNOR cutoff value that reliably predicts lymph node metastasis was not determined.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Proliferation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymph Nodes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastocytosis, Cutaneous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitotic Index</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records from two veterinary teaching hospitals from 1992 to 2014 were reviewed. The aims of the study were to determine imaging findings, common underlying disease processes, and prevalent bacterial species and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in dogs with emphysematous cystitis. The most common lower urinary tract sign was hematuria. Gas was detected in the wall and lumen of the urinary bladder in 14 of 27 dogs (51.9%), in only the wall of the bladder in 9 of 27 dogs (33%), and in only the lumen of the bladder in 4 of 27 dogs (14.8%). Comorbid diseases were identified in all but one case. The most common comorbid disease processes were diabetes mellitus in 33% of dogs, neurologic disease in 26% of dogs, and adrenal disease in 19% of dogs. Bacterial isolates included Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus spp., and Actinomyces spp. Enterococcus spp. were always isolated in mixed infections with gas-producing bacterial species. During the period of study, most isolates were predicted to be susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, but updated veterinary breakpoints suggest that fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would be more appropriate choices for empiric therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Multiple abdominal ultrasounds did not detect the tumor, yet dual-phase computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a focal hypoattenuating nodule in the left lobe of the pancreas. A 3-port laparoscopic approach to the abdomen confirmed a 1.5-cm mass in the mid-left limb of the pancreas, and resection of the mass was performed with a bipolar vessel-sealing device. The surgery was performed without complication, and the dog became normoglycemic within 4 hr following surgery. Final histopathology results revealed pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the &#946; cells. Recurrence of hypoglycemia was noted 18 mo postoperatively; however, repeat computed tomographic angiography did not reveal pancreatic abnormalities and fine needle aspirates of liver nodules did not suggest metastatic disease. Medical management was elected and the patient was euthanized 28 mo after surgery due to refractory hypoglycemic seizures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin-Secreting Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>28892426</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Agreement of Axillary and Auricular Temperature with Rectal Temperature in Systemically Healthy Dogs Undergoing Surgery.</Title>	<Abstract>Obtaining a patient's temperature is an important part of a patient's physical examination. As human medicine transitions to noninvasive temperature measurements, so does veterinary medicine. Historically, temperature measurement has been obtained from rectal readings; however, alternative methods, such as axillary and auricular temperatures, are increasing in popularity. The purpose of the study was to compare these alternative techniques to the gold standard of rectal temperature. Temperatures were obtained three ways for each patient: rectal, axillary, and auricular. Results indicated a positive linear relationship between rectal and axillary temperatures (bivariate correlation coefficient [r] = 0.65, P &lt; .001) and axillary and auricular temperatures (r = 0.55, P &lt; .001). Agreement was strongest between rectal and auricular temperatures (r = 0.80, P &lt; .001). The average discrepancy between axillary and rectal temperature was 1.2&#176;C [2.1&#176;F] with the highest difference being 4.0&#176;C [7.3&#176;F]. The average discrepancy between auricular and rectal temperature was 0.6&#176;C [1.2&#176;F] with the highest difference being 2.2&#176;C [4.1&#176;F]. Despite auricular temperatures having stronger agreement, Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement testing revealed that it was a poor predictor of rectal temperature. Based on these results, axillary and auricular temperatures should not be substituted for rectal temperature.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Axilla</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Temperature</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rectum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Temperature</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two adult, stray dogs were admitted in our clinic with a generalized, multifocal to diffuse and nonpruritic dermatitis that was characterized by severe crusting, scaling, and ulceration. In both instances, leishmaniosis and N/CS were diagnosed by immunofluorescent antibody test serology, lymph node cytology, and skin scrapings in which high numbers of Sarcoptes mites were found. The combination of miticidal and antileishmanial treatment, supported by topical treatment and nutritional support, resulted in the complete resolution of the skin lesions and spectacular improvement of the body condition in both cases. Dog 1 eventually died from end-stage kidney disease attributed to leishmaniosis-associated glomerulonephritis, whereas the also proteinuric dog 2 remains clinically healthy. The manifestation of the rare type of N/CS in these dogs could be attributed to cell-mediated immunosuppression, which was most likely induced by leishmaniosis and malnutrition. The necessity of searching for leishmaniosis in those scabietic cases, especially in the endemic areas of leishmaniosis, is strongly recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Topical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leishmaniasis, Diffuse Cutaneous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoptes scabiei</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scabies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 7 mo old male castrated American bulldog (case 2) presented for vomiting and anorexia for 2 days without diarrhea. Both dogs were diagnosed with mesenteric volvulus based on exploratory laparotomy, which also revealed an intestinal foreign body obstruction. Case 1 required critical care support during recovery but was ultimately discharged, whereas case 2 had an uncomplicated recovery. Both were reported to be back to normal 1 wk after surgery. Case 1 survived 3 mo and then died due to a colonic torsion diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy. Case 2 has been reported to be completely normal more than 18 mo after surgery. These two cases illustrate that mesenteric volvulus can be present with a several-day history of gastrointestinal signs and that shock may be absent on presentation. This is also the first published report of mesenteric volvulus with a concurrent foreign body obstruction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Volvulus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mesentery</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vomiting</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Among the 33 dogs, 18 dogs received LDM-C. Clinical stage was available for all dogs (5 stage I, 18 stage II, and 10 stage III). Nine dogs had macroscopic, and 24 dogs had microscopic disease at the start of DOX treatment. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 125 and 133 days, respectively. Clinical stage and tumor burden (microscopic versus macroscopic) at the start of chemotherapy was prognostic for PFS. No significant difference was observed in PFS or overall survival for the addition of LDM-C after a completed DOX protocol (P = .563 and P = .148, respectively). Based on the results of this retrospective study, the addition of LDM-C therapy as a maintenance regimen following a completed protocol of DOX adjuvant treatment of canine hemangiosarcoma may not improve outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chemotherapy, Adjuvant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In each of these cases, eubacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization enabled colocalization of intrahepatic bacteria with neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation in samples that were negative for bacteria when evaluated by routine hematoxylin and eosin histopathology augmented with histochemical stains. Positive responses to antimicrobial therapy were observed in of 2 out of 2 patients that were treated with antimicrobials. These findings suggest that eubacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histopathological sections is more sensitive than conventional histochemical stains for the diagnosis of bacteria-associated canine hepatitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatitis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Inflammation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The initial negative pressures of EBCT sized 3, 6, 10, and 15 mL were measured and the stability of the system monitored. The pressure-to-volume curve as either air or water was added and maximal filling volumes were measured. Evacuated blood collection tubes beyond the manufacture's expiration date were evaluated for initial negative pressures and maximal filling volumes. Initial negative pressure ranged from -214 mm Hg to -528 mm Hg for EBCT within the manufacturer's expiration date. Different pressure-to-volume curves were found for air versus water. Optimal negative pressures of CSSD are debated in the literature. Drain purpose and type of exudates are factors that should be considered when deciding which EBCT size to implement. Evacuated blood collection tubes have a range of negative pressures and pressure-to-volume curves similar to previously evaluated CSSD rigid reservoirs. Proper drain management and using EBCT within labeled expiration date are important to ensure that expected negative pressures are generated.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drainage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>In Vitro Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The pathogenesis of USMI is multifactorial and complex. Studies have shown variable results regarding the effects and timing of sterilization on the incidence of USMI. Diagnosis of USMI is often based on history, physical examination, and elimination of other differentials. Treatment options for USMI include medications, such as &#945;-adrenergic agents and estrogen products, minimally-invasive urethral bulking procedures, surgical procedures (e.g., indwelling urethral occluders), or combination therapy. The overall prognosis for USMI is typically fair to good with long-term therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29131673</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluation of Parasite Egg and Cyst Recovery Using Devices Designed for Centrifugal or Stationary Flotation.</Title>	<Abstract>Two new devices (OT, ST), were recently introduced for the recovery of parasite eggs and cysts for microscopic examination. These devices, two stationary flotation devices, and a standard double-centrifugal sugar-flotation were compared using common flotation solutions and methods recommended by the manufacturers for the recovery of hookworm, ascaridoid, and whipworm eggs from companion animal fecal samples. Additionally, the recovery of Giardia cysts in the OT device using a zinc sulfate versus sodium nitrate solution was evaluated. Double-centrifugal sugar-flotation (1.30 specific gravity) was the most sensitive method for the recovery of the nematode eggs from feces of companion animals. Overall, centrifugation increased the recovery of eggs as compared with standing flotation methods, with the ST performing equivalently to the OT. Although these more recently introduced tests have good sensitivities for the nematodes tested, egg recovery was routinely markedly less than that achieved by standard double-centrifugal sugar-flotation, and false-negatives did occur. Still, the OT and ST generally have increased recoveries over the two standing flotation devices, and are significantly better than these for the recovery of ascaridoid and whipworm eggs from dog and cat samples. Zinc sulfate (1.18 specific gravity) is recommended for the recovery of Giardia cysts when using the OT device.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Centrifugation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cysts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasite Egg Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parasites</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Radiographs showed a cleft between the second and fifth metacarpal bones of the left thoracic limb compatible with ectrodactyly and spina bifida affecting T4 and T5 vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed dorsal reposition of the spinal cord and a tract connecting from the dura mater to the skin. No other malformations were detected. Surgical excision of the tract was performed and histopathological examination diagnosed a dermoid sinus type IV. Dermoid sinus and spina bifida are well-recognized congenital spinal and spinal cord defects, yet association with other congenital malformation are rarely reported in dogs. The here-reported dog had spinal and spinal cord abnormalities with concurrent limb malformation, which are two components of a nonrandom association of birth defects described as VACTERL in people. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing concurrent dermoid sinus type IV, spina bifida, and ectrodactyly in a dog, and highlights the importance of patient examination for occurrence of multiple malformations to provide an appropriate prognosis for an owner.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anal Canal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophagus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Defects, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Limb Deformities, Congenital</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trachea</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of the study is to describe clinical, imaging, and histopathological findings of this tumor. Medical records and the diagnostic laboratory database at Colorado State University from 2000 to 2015 were reviewed and complete medical records were available for the eight animals in this report. Similar to what has been reported in people, poor long-term survival and high metastatic rate, particularly to the lungs, was observed in our case series. A bimorphic pattern on imaging (radiographs, computed tomography, and MRI) consisting of mineralized and nonmineralized areas was seen mirroring the high-grade sarcomatous component adjacent to a low-grade chondroid component seen histopathologically. A review of the human literature including suspected etiology, imaging findings, histopathology, and survival times with various treatment options is presented. This article describes the first reported cases of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in the veterinary literature. Early accurate recognition could lead to treatment plans tailored to this variant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chondrosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Because pugs are predisposed to necrotizing meningoencephalitis, they may be at higher risk of developing neurologic complications after CEPSS attenuation. We hypothesized that pugs have a higher prevalence of postoperative neurologic complications and that pugs who died due to neurologic complications would have evidence of encephalitis at necropsy. Records were searched for pugs that had undergone surgical correction of a single extrahepatic CEPSS. Fourteen pugs met the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 30 dogs of varying breeds who also underwent surgical attenuation for a single CEPSS. Four of 14 pugs (28.6%) died or were euthanized within 1 mo after surgery for neurologic complications, compared with only 1 of 30 dogs in the control group (P &lt; .029). No evidence of necrotizing meningoencephalitis was seen on necropsy. Pugs may be at an increased risk of developing fatal neurologic complications following surgical attenuation for CEPSS. Further studies are indicated to investigate reasons for this increased risk, as well as to determine any factors that may indicate which pugs are at higher risk.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningoencephalitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Portasystemic Shunt, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The 2018 AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats revise and update earlier guidelines published in 2010. The 2018 guidelines retain much of the information in the earlier guidelines that continues to be applicable in clinical practice, along with new information that represents current expert opinion on controlling DM. An essential aspect of successful DM management is to ensure that the owner of a diabetic dog or cat is capable of administering insulin, recognizing the clinical signs of inadequately managed DM, and monitoring blood glucose levels at home, although this is ideal but not mandatory; all topics that are reviewed in the guidelines. Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for clinical DM. The guidelines provide recommendations for using each insulin formulation currently available for use in dogs and cats, the choice of which is generally based on efficacy and duration of effect in the respective species. Also discussed are non-insulin therapeutic medications and dietary management. These treatment modalities, along with insulin therapy, give the practitioner an assortment of options for decreasing the clinical signs of DM while avoiding hypoglycemia, the two conditions that represent the definition of a controlled diabetic. The guidelines review identifying and monitoring patients at risk for developing DM, which are important for avoiding unnecessary insulin therapy in patients with transient hyperglycemia or mildly elevated blood glucose.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypoglycemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed based on ultrasonography, cystoscopy, urinalysis, and culture of Corynebacterium urealyticum from the urine. Unilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter were suspected to be secondary to obstruction at the trigone. The dog was treated with focal debridement of plaques at the left ureter, urinary acidification, and long-term antibiotic therapy with complete recovery. This is the first report of encrusted cystitis as a complication of cystoscopic-guided laser ablation for ectopic ureters, and suggests cystoscopic debridement may be useful if ureteral obstruction occurs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laser Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ureter</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ureteral Obstruction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Closure patterns included a modified Gambee, simple interrupted, simple continuous, and skin staple closure. Forty-eight 3-cm enterotomy constructs were created from jejunal segments harvested from 12 dogs. Twelve each were randomly assigned to the four closure methods. Time of closure, as well as initial and maximum leak pressures, were measured and compared. The modified Gambee closure was the slowest closure to perform, with skin staple closure being the fastest. All suture patterns tested had higher mean initial leak pressures than reported physiologic intestinal pressures during peristalsis, although the skin staple closures resulted in leakage below normal physiologic pressure in several samples. The modified Gambee closure was able to sustain a significantly higher initial leak pressure than skin staple closures. The modified Gambee suture pattern had the greatest maximum leak pressure of all enterotomy closure patterns tested. Use of the modified Gambee suture pattern should be considered in enterotomy closure, although in vivo studies are required to determine if these differences are clinically significant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Suture Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sutures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Direct access to the sinus via the nasal ostium was possible with a flexible endoscope to allow sinuscopy. Debridement of fungal plaques in the frontal sinus and the nasal cavity was performed, and a sinus and nasal deposition therapy with clotrimazole (1%) cream was made under rhinoscopic guidance. No oral medication was administered following the procedure. A rhinoscopic follow-up was performed monthly until cure. Six of ten (60%) dogs presented fungal plaques in the nasal cavity and in the frontal sinus and 4/10 (40%) dogs presented fungal plaques only in the frontal sinus. Five of ten (50%) dogs were considered to be cured at the first follow-up rhinoscopy, 4/10 (40%) after the second follow-up, and 1/10 (10%) after the third. Two dogs had delayed recurrence of SNA rhinoscopically assessed 12 and 21 mo, respectively, after the last clotrimazole treatment. Endoscopic debridement of fungal plaques and clotrimazole (1%) cream deposition therapy seems to be a valuable minimally invasive technique for SNA treatment in dogs without the use of complementary oral medication. Delayed recurrence is a potential finding following treatment of SNA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aspergillosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Clotrimazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Debridement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasal Cavity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Patients diagnosed with unilateral cranial cruciate ligament disease requiring a 9- or 12-mm TTA cage were included. Twenty-six consecutive client-owned dogs were prospectively selected for this clinical study. Age, weight, sex, breed, cage size, surgery date, and follow-up time were recorded. Radiographs were scored for healing and measured for PTA immediately, at 6 wk, and at 10 wk postoperatively. All stifles were assessed for complications throughout the study period. Stifles with PGA cages had similar overall healing scores compared to previously reported values for metallic cages, and the PTA was well maintained at 6 and 10 wk postoperatively. Polyglycolic acid cages were associated with a higher complication rate (10/26, 38%; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.61) compared with previously reported complication rates for metallic cages. Despite favorable healing scores and overall PTA maintenance, PGA cage use resulted in a high complication rate. Proposed advantages offered by this particular implant over currently used metallic cages are offset by this high complication rate. Additional investigation of bioabsorbable materials and implant design should be considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyglycolic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tibia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computed tomography and MRI scans showed a well-defined, ovoid, single mass in the left dorsal cervical region connected to the common carotid artery, histologically consistent with carotid body paraganglioma. The mass was surgically resected. Frameless stereotactic body radiation therapy with volumetric modulated arc therapy was set up as adjuvant treatment. After radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin was started. During the first yr of follow-up, acute grade I dermatitis and grade I left-side laryngeal mucositis were recognized. One yr after radiation therapy, no signs of late radiotoxicity or tumor recurrence were observed. Grade I thrombocytopenia concurrent with chemotherapy was observed. This is the first reported case of a carotid body paraganglioma treated by multimodal therapy, with surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Thirty-nine patients with encephalic and spinal meningiomas assumed from MRI findings were recruited and received high-dose hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy by a linear accelerator equipped with an external beam modulator micro-multileaf collimator and an XVI cone beam computed tomography system. The prescribed mean dose was 33 Gy in five fractions. The treatment feasibility was tested through planned and delivered dose agreement checks. Regular clinical examinations were performed during and after irradiation time, with regard to mentation, deambulation, cranial nerve dysfunction, and seizures. Serial MRI exams were done 60 days after irradiation and after 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo. Volumetric disease reduction criteria implemented with clinical neurological systematic evaluation were adopted to assess the course and to categorize patients' responses. Complete and partial responses were observed on the whole in 65.5% of alive patients 24 mo after irradiation. Two-yr overall and disease-specific survival rates were 74.3% and 97.4%, respectively, and the putative radiotoxic effects were found to be few and slight.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningeal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiotherapy Dosage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical characteristics of English bulldogs with presumed ARVC. The medical records were searched for English bulldogs examined between 2001 and 2013 with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC. The average age of the 31 dogs identified was 9.2 &#177; 1.6 yr (range 7-13 yr). Males were overrepresented by a factor of 2.9 to 1. At initial presentation, 5 dogs had subclinical arrhythmia, 10 dogs had clinical signs attributable to arrhythmia, and 16 dogs had congestive heart failure. Eighteen dogs (58%) had ventricular tachycardia and five (16%) also had supraventricular arrhythmias. Four dogs experienced sudden death, 2 dogs died from congestive heart failure, 11 dogs were euthanized for cardiac causes, and 2 dogs died or were euthanized for noncardiac causes. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median survival time of 8.3 mo. This is the first study to describe the clinical characteristics of a population of English bulldogs with presumed ARVC. Further studies are needed to better characterize the clinical features of the disease in this breed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Breeding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs diagnosed with LSA and previously treated with chemotherapy were included in the study. A total of 20 dogs met the inclusion criteria, and 19 were evaluable for response. Bleomycin was administered subcutaneously on days 1 and 8 and cytosine arabinoside was administered subcutaneously on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. The median number of chemotherapy drugs given prior to the administration of Bleo/Cytarabine was 8.5. A total of 23 cycles of Bleo/Cytarabine were administered. The overall response rate was 36.8% (7 of 19 dogs had a partial response). The median time to progression was 15 days. Three dogs developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia and one dog had a grade 4 neutropenia.

In this study, 114 dogs had a visual awake examination of the oral cavity and were administered an oral-fluid thiol-detection test prior to undergoing a a full-mouth anesthetized oral examination and digital dental radiographs. The results show the visual awake examination underestimated the presence and severity of active periodontal disease. The thiol-detection test was superior to the visual awake examination at detecting the presence and severity of active periodontal disease and was an indicator of progression toward alveolar bone loss. The thiol-detection test detected active periodontal disease at early stages of development, before any visual cues were present, indicating the need for intervention to prevent periodontal bone loss. Early detection is important because without intervention, dogs with gingivitis (active periodontal disease) progress to irreversible periodontal bone loss (stage 2+). As suggested in the current AAHA guidelines, a thiol-detection test administered in conjunction with the visual awake examination during routine wellness examinations facilitates veterinarian-client communication and mitigates under-diagnosis of periodontal disease and underutilization of dental services. The thiol-detection test can be used to monitor the periodontal health status of the conscious patient during follow-up examinations based on disease severity.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gingivitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Periodontal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sulfhydryl Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wakefulness</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The adhesive patch monitor (APM) is a single-lead, lightweight, up to 14-day continuous ambulatory ECG monitor. This study aimed to prospectively assess its usability in four boxer dogs considered either to be healthy or to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Optimal recording was obtained by placing the APM on the left side of the animal's thorax, at the fifth intercostal space, slightly dorsal to the costochondral junction, and oriented either vertically or parallel to the long axis of the heart. In three dogs, the APM remained attached for 14 days. One dog removed the APM after 59 hr. Skin irritation was documented in all dogs and resolved spontaneously after removal of the APM. The analyzable time was &gt;93% of the total wear time and recordings provided an unambiguous rhythm diagnosis at rest. Walking, running, or playing caused intermittent motion artifact that could impair ECG interpretation. APM results were comparable to those obtained with 24-hr Holter monitoring. Extended continuous ECG monitoring with the APM is feasible in boxer dogs and provides interpretable recordings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adhesives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography, Ambulatory</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two full-thickness skin wounds, measuring 2 &#215; 2 cm, were created on both sides of the dorsal midline of 10 cats; bilaterally, one randomly selected wound was bandaged with a hydrocolloid dressing and the second one (control) with a semiocclusive pad. Subjective clinical evaluation of granulation tissue formation, of the quantity and nature of wound exudate, and planimetry were performed on the right-side wounds, and histological examination on the left. No significant differences in subjective clinical evaluation or in planimetry were observed between the hydrocolloid-treated wounds and controls. Most wounds had serous or absence of exudate (41.25% and 25%, respectively), whereas purulent exudate was observed in 7.5% of wounds. Edema was significantly increased in the hydrocolloid-treated wounds compared with controls on day 7 but no significant differences in the other histological variables were observed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bandages, Hydrocolloid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colloids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intention</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This retrospective case series describes six miniature dachshunds with refractory ICRP, who were treated with chlorambucil (CLB) combined with firocoxib or prednisolone. Improvement in clinical manifestations was seen in five of the six dogs by the end of the study period; four were treated with CLB/firocoxib and one with CLB/prednisolone. One dog had nonregenerative anemia after 23 mo of treatment with CLB, but whether there was a causative relationship was unclear. No severe adverse events were observed during treatment in the remaining five dogs. CLB in combination with firocoxib or prednisolone appears to be an effective alternative treatment for ICRP in dogs.

Overall, eight dogs (21%) experienced grade 3 neutropenia and five dogs (14%) experienced grade 4 neutropenia on day 7 following mitoxantrone chemotherapy. Dogs &#8804;10 kg body weight were significantly more likely to develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (5.8 relative risk; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-12.9; P &lt; .0001) than dogs &gt;10 kg.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to document azotemia and proteinuria in dogs infected with Babesia sp. and to describe the response to antiprotozoal therapy. The electronic database of the North Carolina State University Vector Borne Disease Laboratory was searched to identify dogs who were diagnosed with babesiosis and to determine if they had proteinuria and/or azotemia. Dogs were excluded if they had coinfections or comorbidities known to cause glomerular injury. Of 35 dogs identified during the initial search, 5 were included; however, only 4 of these dogs had both pre- and posttreatment data. All five dogs were American pit bull terriers or American pit bull terrier-mixed breed dogs, were infected with Babesia gibsoni, and had hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. Three dogs had azotemia. Responses to antiprotozoal treatment included normalization of (three) or increase in (one) serum albumin, resolution (one) or improvement (one) of azotemia, and reduction in proteinuria (two). Laboratory findings consistent with glomerular disease can be found in Babesia gibsoni-infected dogs, and treatment can lead to improvement of the azotemia and proteinuria.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Azotemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Babesiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA, Protozoan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proteinuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ninety-two dogs diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism met the entrance criteria and were enrolled into the study. Levothyroxine sodium was administered to each dog on a daily basis either as the whole dose q 24 hr or as half the dose q 12 hr. Dosing started at 0.1 mg/10 lb (0.022 mg/kg) and continued for approximately 6 mo to Day 182. During this time, the thyroid status of each dog was evaluated at monthly intervals. For the determination of effectiveness, dogs classified as euthyroid at Day 182, based on their thyroid hormone values, were considered treatment successes. Results of the statistical analysis showed that there was no difference between the two dosing regimens (P = .11) and that when the data from both groups were pooled, the overall success rate was 75.64% (95% confidence interval = 66.34%).

<Rec><Common><PMID>29757662</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>A Review of the Surgical Management of Perineal Hernias in Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>Perineal hernia refers to the failure of the muscular pelvic diaphragm to support the rectal wall, resulting in herniation of pelvic and, occasionally, abdominal viscera into the subcutaneous perineal region. The proposed causes of pelvic diaphragm weakness include tenesmus associated with chronic prostatic disease or constipation, myopathy, rectal abnormalities, and gonadal hormonal imbalances. The most common presentation of perineal hernia in dogs is a unilateral or bilateral nonpainful swelling of the perineum. Clinical signs do occur, but not always. Clinical signs may include constipation, obstipation, dyschezia, tenesmus, rectal prolapse, stranguria, or anuria. The definitive diagnosis of perineal hernia is based on clinical signs and findings of weak pelvic diaphragm musculature during a digital rectal examination. In dogs, perineal hernias are mostly treated by surgical intervention. Appositional herniorrhaphy is sometimes difficult to perform as the levator ani and coccygeus muscles are atrophied and unsuitable for use. Internal obturator muscle transposition is the most commonly used technique. Additional techniques include superficial gluteal and semitendinosus muscle transposition, in addition to the use of synthetic implants and biomaterials. Pexy techniques may be used to prevent rectal prolapse and bladder and prostate gland displacement. Postoperative care involves analgesics, antibiotics, a low-residue diet, and stool softeners.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herniorrhaphy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Perineum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical signs, surgical findings, and culture results were consistent with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Initial management consisted of extensive surgical debridement, wound lavage, and bandaging. Surgical closure was achieved with an axillary fold flap and distant direct single-pedicle thoracoabdominal flap. Three mo later, following deterioration of the lameness that was associated with carpal valgus, carpal subluxation, and tendinopathy of the distal radial insertion of the biceps brachii tendon, a closing wedge pancarpal arthrodesis and tenotomy of the biceps brachii tendon was performed. We hypothesize that extensive soft tissue trauma and subsequent fibrosis and tendon contracture following soft tissue reconstruction contributed to the complications seen.

Itraconazole bioassay was performed on serum/plasma from 95 dogs and 20 cats receiving itraconazole (compounded from bulk powder, generic pelletized, or brand name) for systemic mycosis treatment. Mean itraconazole concentration was lower in the compounded group (n = 42) as compared with the generic (n = 40) or brand name (n = 33) groups (0.5 &#181;g/mL versus 8.3 &#181;g/mL and 6.5 &#181;g/mL, respectively; P &lt; .001).

Hair cycle arrest (alopecia X) is a noninflammatory alopecia that is frustrating to diagnose and treat due to lack of understanding of disease pathogenesis. A variety of therapies for hair cycle arrest have been described with inconsistent efficacy in different dog breeds and sexes; no definitive treatment is available. This report describes the use of a deslorelin acetate implant in two sexually intact adult male keeshonden, both diagnosed with hair cycle arrest. The dogs had progressive alopecia of the trunk that spared the head and distal limbs present for at least 2 yr. Diagnosis of hair cycle arrest was made based on clinical features, dermatohistopathology, and lack of systemic abnormalities. Treatment with a single subcutaneous 4.7 mg deslorelin acetate implant resulted in profuse hair regrowth within 3.5 mo that endured for at least 14 mo. Deslorelin implantation is a management option that is safe, affordable, and appears effective for sexually intact male keeshonden with hair cycle arrest.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Alopecia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Implants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Luteolytic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triptorelin Pamoate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal radiography revealed two round, disk-shaped, metallic-opacity foreign objects within the bowel with loss of serosal detail. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and revealed circumferential full-thickness necrosis and perforation of the intestines at the ileocolic junction with a small amount of peritoneal effusion. Two disk batteries were palpated in the colon and milked out of the rectum. An ileocolic anastomosis was performed without complication. However, the dog died following cardiopulmonary arrest shortly after extubation. Disk batteries are capable of causing severe tissue necrosis due to the generation of electric current when prolonged contact with mucosal surfaces occurs.

Physical examination findings included dehydration, tachypnea, tachycardia, and muffled heart sounds. Thoracic radiographs revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography revealed a mild volume of pericardial effusion and no evidence of right atrial tamponade or a cardiac-associated mass. Cytological analysis of the pericardial effusion was consistent with blood. There was no evidence of neoplasia. Coagulation parameters were within normal limits. Initial treatment consisted of pericardiocentesis. A subtotal pericardiectomy was later performed. No surgical complications were noted, and the dog was discharged 2 days following surgery. Results of the histological examination of the pericardium revealed hemangiosarcoma. Treatment with doxorubicin was initiated 12 days after surgery, at which time, pulmonary metastasis was suspected. The dog survived for 18 days after subtotal pericardiectomy, when it was euthanized because of complications presumably related to pulmonary metastatic disease. This is the first published report of primary pericardial hemangiosarcoma. The dog had a short survival time; thus, the response to subtotal pericardiectomy combined with adjuvant doxorubicin treatment could not be determined. Pulmonary metastatic disease was suspected 12 days following surgery. Based on this case report, pericardial hemangiosarcoma carries a guarded prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pericardium</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-six days following the original surgery, the dog was re-presented with signs consistent with an intestinal obstruction. A mural intestinal abscess was found as the cause of the obstruction during exploratory surgery, and the site was successfully removed with a resection and anastomosis. Histopathology showed multifocal abscessation with cyst-like structures partially lined with mucosa. The dog recovered without complication and remains healthy 4 mo later. The exact cause of the lesion is not known; however, local contamination through a focal mucosal defect or complications related to the use of barbed suture in the original enterotomy repair may have contributed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Jejunum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On physical exam, the patient was febrile and tachycardic, and an arrhythmia with pulse deficits was noted. Clinicopathological abnormalities included thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, nonregenerative anemia, and mild hypoalbuminemia. The patient progressed overnight to develop a productive cough, and an echocardiogram performed the next morning revealed irregular proliferative lesions of the pulmonic valve with moderate pulmonic regurgitation. Subsequent blood cultures grew two organisms: alpha-hemolytic streptococci spp. and Empedobacter brevis. The dog was treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics for 2 wk and then switched to oral therapy. The clinicopathologic abnormalities, fever, and clinical signs resolved with oral antibiotic treatment. To the authors' knowledge, this case report represents the first detailed published case of bacterial endocarditis with E brevis bacteremia involving the pulmonic valve. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up are discussed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Endocarditis, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flavobacteriaceae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Flavobacteriaceae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Valve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Streptococcus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On examination, an ill-defined left maxillary mass, a 2 cm swelling under the left eye, and an enlarged left mandibular lymph node were noted. The dog was bright and alert but appeared painful upon jaw extension. Cytology from the lymph node revealed metastatic disease. Thoracic radiographs and computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary nodules. Computed tomography of the head and neck revealed a 6.7 &#215; 4.1 &#215; 6.5 cm mass at the rostral aspect of the left zygomatic arch invading the orbit. A second opinion of the biopsy specimen in conjunction with positive immunohistochemical staining for desmin led to a revised diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Treatment consisted of three doses of palliative radiation therapy, in 8 Gy fractions, and chemotherapy with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. A rapid clinical response was noted shortly after treatment initiation; however, the response was temporary, and the dog was euthanized due to widespread metastatic disease and associated clinical signs 74 days after initial therapy.

Medical records of dogs who received PT from 2002 to 2016 were reviewed. A questionnaire was given to owners verbally or by e-mail to ascertain their perception of their dog's outcome after PT. Median time to questionnaire administration from PT surgery was 608 days (64-3,708). Owner satisfaction after PT was high (89.7%), with the majority stating they would have the procedure performed again (79.5%). Owners reported an improvement in their dog's personality (30.8%) and increased activity (41%). Median survival time was 1,825 days (64-2,663), with 6 of 39 dogs (15.4%) alive at study end. Of the 33 dogs who died, 11 (33.3%) died from underlying respiratory conditions suspected to be related to the PT. The overall complication rate was 82.1%, with mucus secretion being the most common. Revision surgery was required in 30.8% of dogs (most commonly due to skin occlusion), and aspiration pneumonia occurred in 17.9% of dogs. Overall, owner satisfaction after PT in dogs is high despite intensive postoperative management, and long survival times can be achieved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tracheostomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A survey containing a combination of multiple-choice and open-ended questions was distributed via e-mail with an online link during 2013 to graduates of the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine. Demographic data and opinions regarding treatment for cases of canine heartworm disease (HWD) were obtained, and motivation for recommending different treatment strategies was assessed. Nearly all 170 respondents (99%) indicated that they recommend melarsomine dihydrochloride for first-line treatment of canine HWD. Exercise restriction (80%) and monthly heartworm preventive (75%) were components of the treatment approach to HWD with no clinical signs. The majority of respondents (74%) indicated that when first-line treatment recommendations were declined, they endorsed long-term administration of ivermectin (i.e., "slow-kill" method) despite current American Heartworm Society guidelines that recommend against the use of long-term macrocyclic lactone administration for the monotherapy treatment of canine HWD. Respondents also indicated that owners' financial concerns frequently result in modification of HWD treatment. Routine inclusion of exercise restriction is commonly, but not universally, utilized and may represent an opportunity for improvement in the management of this disease. In addition, when first-line recommendations for heartworm disease treatment are declined, a two-dose melarsomine protocol instead of the slow-kill method should be considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Cortex Hormones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arsenicals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cholestyramine Resin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dirofilariasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxycycline</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ivermectin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Conditioning, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Schools, Veterinary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Triazines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ten dogs were divided in two groups. In the INC group, the soft palate was incised with scissors and the wound was sutured in a continuous pattern. In the PBRA group, a wand was used to ablate the desired portion of the soft palate, without suture. Clinical, biological, macroscopic, and histologic assessments were scheduled over 14 days. The duration of surgery was significantly shorter for the PBRA group. The C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly higher in the PBRA group at 6 hr and on day 3 (P &lt; .05) but with values very close to the baseline. C-reactive protein concentrations were maximal, but with low values (&lt;25 mg/L), at day 1 for both techniques. The irregularity scores for the soft palate caudal border on days 1, 3, and 14 were significantly higher in the INC group than in the PBRA group (P &lt; .05). The main histopathologic changes were the presence of superficial granulomas and a significantly greater depth of tissue damage in the INC group (2.5 &#177; 0.3 mm) compared with the PBRA group (1.5 &#177; 0.1 mm; P &lt; .05). PBRA compared favorably with the traditional technique in terms of ease, duration of surgery, and depth of tissue damage. Future studies are warranted to validate its effectiveness for treating brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Airway Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Catheter Ablation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrosurgery</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palate, Soft</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plastic Surgery Procedures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A reduction in HRV is used as an index of pain in neonatal human patients. Objective measures of pain would be valuable in the evaluation of canine patients and assessment of response to pain management strategies. We hypothesized that dogs with diseases associated with discomfort (osteoarthritis and bone neoplasia) would have reduced HRV compared with normal, healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to calculate the sample size necessary to investigate this hypothesis. Seventeen dogs from the Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania patient population or owned by Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania staff were enrolled in this single-blind, prospective pilot study. A 30 min electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained from each dog using an ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor. All ECGs were obtained between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ECGs were analyzed and time-domain HRV indices computed. Sample size calculations suggest that 207 dogs would be necessary to ascertain if HRV is reduced in dogs experiencing discomfort or pain (50 in the arthritis group, 79 in the bone cancer group, and 78 in the control group).</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Autonomic Nervous System</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electrocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sample Size</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Studies reporting long-term outcome of cats after surgical removal of solitary pancreatic carcinomas are rare, due to the uncommon diagnosis and paucity of cats who undergo treatment. In this study, nine cases of feline exocrine pancreatic carcinoma from seven academic and private practice veterinary hospitals were reviewed to examine the outcome in cats undergoing surgical removal of the mass. The median postsurgical survival time for the nine cats was 316.5 days (range, 25-964 days), with three cats alive at a median follow-up time of 309 days. This study demonstrates that surgical removal of pancreatic exocrine tumors in cats with localized disease can result in survival times of over 300 days.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records were reviewed to extract information on long-term (&gt;365 days) outcome data. Telephone owner questionnaire was performed to assess postoperative urinary continence scores (scale 1-10, where 10 is complete continence) and the presence and frequency of complications. Twenty female dogs were included. Mean (&#177;standard deviation) time to follow-up was 1,205.1 (&#177;627.4) days. Median continence score/10 (range) was 3.5 (2-6) preoperatively, and 9.0 (7-10) at the last follow-up. Median continence score was significantly higher at all time points postoperatively compared with before surgery (P &lt; .001). Complete continence was achieved in 90% of bitches. Minor complications occurred in 13 bitches and included dysuria (8), bacterial cystitis (8), longer urination time (10), incisional seroma (5), urinary retention (3), hematuria (2), and pain when urinating (2). Major complications occurred in one dog (static hydraulic urethral sphincter removed 28 mo after placement). Continence scores were sustainably improved in the long-term. Complications were mostly minor. Urinary tract infections were the most common but resolved with conventional antibiotic treatment.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Follow-Up Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Sphincter, Artificial</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Efficacy of peritoneal lavage has not been proven in veterinary studies. Our objective was to evaluate differences in bacterial identity and susceptibility in samples obtained pre- and postlavage in animals who underwent laparotomy for treatment of septic peritonitis and to assess the effect of empirical antimicrobial selection on survival. Culture samples were collected from the peritoneal surface pre- and postlavage from dogs and cats treated surgically for septic peritonitis. Culture results were compared for each patient with regard to bacterial isolates and bacterial susceptibility profiles. Survival to discharge was evaluated. Microbial growth occurred in at least one culture in 88.6% of patients. There was no significant difference in bacterial isolates or susceptibility profiles pre- versus postlavage. Positive culture pre- or postlavage and appropriate antimicrobial selection did not significantly affect survival. For individual animals, culture results differed between pre- and postlavage samples, although no definitive effect of peritoneal lavage was seen for the population as a whole. Antimicrobials most commonly effective against isolates were Cefotaxime, Ceftazidime, and Imipenem. If prompt surgical source control is employed, antibiotic choice may not affect clinical outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteriological Techniques</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritoneal Lavage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this prospective, a descriptive cohort study on 100 client-owned dogs who were presented with GDV, is to describe a modified belt-loop gastropexy and determine its intraoperative complications and long-term efficacy. The transversus abdominis muscle was used to make an oblique belt-loop. A seromuscular antral fold, instead of a seromuscular antral flap, was passed through the belt-loop, and then, the passed portion of the antral fold was sutured to the dissected edge of the abdominal wall. Intraoperative complications related to gastropexy were recorded, and the incidence of GDV recurrence was determined a minimum of 1 yr postoperatively via telephone with the referring veterinarians and the owners. There were no intraoperative complications related to the modified belt-loop gastropexy technique. Based on follow-up conversations, none of the dogs presented signs of GDV recurrence during the follow-up period. Based on the results, there is strong clinical evidence that a modified belt-loop gastropexy prevents recurrence of GDV in dogs surviving an acute episode.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastropexy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Volvulus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a simple and affordable biomarker that has been used in human clinical settings of sepsis but has not been investigated in veterinary species. We evaluated NLR in dogs with septic and nonseptic systemic inflammatory diseases and compared with a healthy dog population. An NLR &#8805;6 had an 84.39% sensitivity and 86.95% specificity to identify dogs with systemic inflammatory states; however, no ratio distinguished septic and nonseptic causes. The NLR was not associated with length of hospitalization, morbidity based on the acute patient physiologic laboratory evaluation scoring system, or mortality. The disassociation may be due to the retrospective nature of the study, including a restricted population size and acquisition of only a one-time blood sample. NLR is currently of limited use for diagnosis and prognosis in systemic inflammatory states in dogs, and larger, prospective studies are necessary to further evaluate NLR.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphocyte Count</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutrophils</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prognosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recently, the escalating use of multiagent immunosuppression protocols (especially those that include cyclosporine) has resulted in an increased number of patients with opportunistic fungal infection encountered by small animal practitioners and has altered the typical case phenotype. Based on histologic and cytologic features such as pigmentation, hyphal diameter, and distribution in tissue, these opportunistic mycoses can be placed into categories such as phaeohyphomycosis, hyalohyphomycosis, and eumycotic mycetoma. This review aims to summarize the clinical presentations, methods for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and prognosis for both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with opportunistic fungal infections.

All dogs were assigned a BAS score based on an owner questionnaire. Inclusion criteria included presentation to the hospital for a problem unrelated to the respiratory system and unremarkable blood analyses and physical examination. In awake dogs, SpO2 values were obtained from a minimum of two sites. Dogs were then sedated, and SpO2 values were obtained again concurrently with an arterial blood gas sample. The SpO2 values were significantly lower in BD compared with MDD, but there were no statistically significant differences between BD and MDD for any arterial blood gas parameters.

This blinded, randomized prospective study compared the quality of clinical recovery and duration of hospitalization in canine parvoviral dogs receiving either maropitant (1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb] IV q 24 hr, n = 11) or ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg [0.23 mg/lb] IV q 8 hr, n = 11). All dogs were treated with IV fluids, cefoxitin, and enteral nutrition. Frequency of vomiting and pain scoring were recorded twice daily. Rescue analgesics and antiemetics were administered as dictated by specific pain and vomiting criteria. Clinical severity scoring, body weight, and caloric intake were monitored daily. When comparing dogs receiving maropitant versus ondansetron, respectively, there were no differences in duration of hospitalization (3.36 &#177; 0.56 versus 2.73 &#177; 0.38 days, P = .36), requirement of rescue antiemetic (3/11 versus 5/11 dogs, P = .66), duration of vomiting (5 versus 4 days, P = .65), or days to voluntary food intake (2 versus 1.5 days, P = 1.0). Results of this study suggest that maropitant and ondansetron are equally effective in controlling clinical signs associated with parvoviral enteritis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enteritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ondansetron</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parvoviridae Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parvovirus, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quinuclidines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On initial examination, the dog was non-weight bearing on his right rear limb. Ophthalmic examination revealed a centrally located, superficial corneal ulcer in the right eye and blood in the anterior chamber. Radiographic findings of the pelvis and right rear were suggestive of avascular necrosis of the right femoral neck with resultant fracture and possible avascular necrosis of the left femoral neck. The dog presented 20 days later for evaluation of an acute left rear limb lameness. A left distal femur Salter-Harris type II fracture; a nondisplaced, healing right pubic fracture; and a healing right zygomatic arch transverse fracture were seen on radiographs. The dog's initial injuries were attributed to a routine fall at home, and radiographic interpretation suggested that this was plausible. Subsequent patient visits, evaluation of additional injuries, and interviews with the owner indicated that both animal and domestic abuse had occurred. Veterinarians must be alert to recognize signs of animal abuse and must be aware of the connection between animal and domestic abuse.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corneal Ulcer</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnostic Errors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Femur</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Physical Abuse</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Such a breach, in the practice or home-care setting, can lead to medical, social, and financial impacts on patients, clients, and staff, as well as damage the reputation of the hospital. To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout the hospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice. To support these recommendations, these practice-oriented guidelines include step-by-step instructions to upgrade ICPB efforts in any hospital, including recommendations on the following: establishing an infection control practitioner to coordinate and implement the ICPB program; developing evidence-based standard operating procedures related to tasks performed frequently by the veterinary team (hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, phone triage, etc.); assessing the facility's ICPB strengths and areas of improvement; creating a staff education and training plan; cataloging client education material specific for use in the practice; implementing a surveillance program; and maintaining a compliance evaluation program. Practices with few or no ICPB protocols should be encouraged to take small steps. Creating visible evidence that these protocols are consistently implemented within the hospital will invariably strengthen the loyalties of clients to the hospital as well as deepen the pride the staff have in their roles, both of which are the basis of successful veterinary practice.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Infection Control</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Security Measures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A sinusotomy was performed, with intraoperative infusion of amikacin-impregnated gel and systemic administration of postoperative amikacin. Antibiotic therapy was initially chosen because of historic culture of Mycoplasma. Fungal culture of the frontal sinus identified S. brevicaulis by combined phenotypic characterization and DNA sequencing after morphologic analysis failed to identify the organism. Systemic terbinafine therapy was instituted after fungal culture results were available. The patient recovered well and has had no clinical relapse of disease 3 yr after treatment. This is the first reported case of a fungal rhinosinusitis caused by S. brevicaulis in a dog. Reports of Scopulariopsis infections in humans indicate that treatment of S. brevicaulis infection is hampered by multidrug resistance; prognosis may be poor in people with invasive infections and is currently unknown in dogs. Multimodal therapy, including concurrent surgical and systemic intervention, may be necessary to optimize treatment success.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mycoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rhinitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scopulariopsis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sinusitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Terbinafine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Partial response was achieved in three dogs, stable disease was achieved in one dog, and progressive disease occurred in two dogs, according to the canine Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0. Observed adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and reported in accordance with the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group's common terminology criteria for adverse events v1.1. Activities of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase decreased in the cases that were sensitive to treatment with toceranib, whereas the activities remained high in resistant cases. Additionally, the level of phospho-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 was found to be increased in a resistant case. Single-agent toceranib might prove to be an effective treatment for canine hepatocellular carcinoma pending further validation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A secondary objective was to describe the time elapsed between vaccination and initial diagnosis of IMHA. A medical record search identified cases meeting criteria for primary IMHA. Owners and referring veterinarians were surveyed regarding vaccination of the dog following diagnosis. Referring veterinarians were surveyed regarding vaccination prior to diagnosis of IMHA. A completed survey was returned in 44 cases. Twenty-two dogs received vaccinations after diagnosis, and 22 dogs did not. The median time elapsed between vaccination and initial diagnosis was 280 days. No dog was vaccinated within 30 days of diagnosis. Two of the following possible reactions were noted out of 22 dogs vaccinated: vomiting and urticarial eruption in a dog administered a rabies and canine distemper vaccine, and recurrent anemia in a dog administered a rabies vaccine. The rate of vaccine reactions was higher than previously reported, although the time period evaluated was longer than in previous studies. The relationship between initial vaccination and development of IMHA, and between vaccination and vaccine reaction, in this population is uncertain and may reflect coincidence or differences in susceptibility.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rabies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Time Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viral Vaccines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This pilot study was conducted to determine preliminary pharmacokinetic parameters and relative oral bioavailability of a human generic and veterinary proprietary 4:1 amoxicillin-clavulanic acid formulation in healthy dogs to evaluate whether drug exposure was similar and to determine if further comparative investigation is warranted. Each dog received a single oral dose of each formulation containing 500:125 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid at two separate instances with a 2 wk washout period between product administration. Following drug administration, blood was collected at fixed times over 24 hr to measure plasma amoxicillin and clavulanic acid concentrations using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. There were no statistically significant differences between pharmacokinetic parameters of either formulation. Clavulanic acid showed greater between-dog variation in drug exposure between formulations compared with amoxicillin and was also observed to be more variable within the veterinary proprietary formulation. The average relative oral bioavailability was 98.2% (23.6% coefficient of variation) for amoxicillin and 152.6% (64.3% coefficient of variation) for clavulanic acid between formulations. This pilot investigation supports the need for further bioequivalence studies regarding these formulations before commenting on product interchangeability.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Area Under Curve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Lactamase Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biological Availability</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Compounding</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drugs, Generic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Half-Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The prevalence of copper in routine diagnostic liver cytology samples, clinical findings associated with high cytologic copper (cCu) grade, and the correlation between cCu grade and histologic findings, including histologic copper (hCu) grade, are unknown. This data may be helpful in ascertaining when to determine a cCu grade and when interpreting cCu grade. Clinical data and available archived hepatic histologic and cytologic samples from 198 dogs were collected, evaluated, rhodanine stained, and graded for copper. Prevalence of increased cCu &gt;5 in a randomly collected group of 163 individuals, and the correlation between cCu and clinical data (n = 198), hCu grade (n = 37), or findings on hematoxylin and eosin-stained hepatic sections (n = 32) were evaluated. The observed prevalence was 1.23%. Dogs with elevated alanine transaminase &gt;180 IU/L or aspartate transaminase &gt;90 IU/L and patients who subsequently had hepatic copper quantification were statistically more likely to have pathologic levels of copper detected by cytology. There was significant and modest correlation between cCu and hCu, interface hepatitis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis.

The hypothesis was that transdermal phenobarbital would achieve therapeutic serum concentrations (15-45 &#181;g/mL) with minimal short-term adverse effects. Enrolled cats had normal physical and neurologic exams and unremarkable bloodwork. Transdermal phenobarbital in a pluronic lecithin organogel-based vehicle was administered at a dosage of 3.0-3.1 mg/kg per ear pinna (total of 6.0-6.2 mg/kg) every 12 hr for 14 days. Serum phenobarbital concentrations were measured 3-6 hr after dosing at seven different times over 15 days. The mean and median serum concentration of phenobarbital at study completion were 5.57 and 4.08 &#181;g/mL, respectively. Mean peak concentration and mean time to peak concentration were 5.94 &#181;g/mL and 13.3 days, respectively. Mild adverse effects were observed. Potency was analyzed in three replicates of the transdermal phenobarbital gel administered; potencies ranged from 62.98 to 82.02%. Transdermal application of phenobarbital in healthy cats achieves a detectable, but subtherapeutic, serum concentration and appears safe in the short term. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended when this formulation of phenobarbital is used to ensure therapeutic serum concentrations are achieved.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Cutaneous</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Monitoring</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gels</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypnotics and Sedatives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phenobarbital</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Elimination of organisms from the renal tubules terminates leptospiruria and prevents transmission of the organism. This report describes the discovery of persistent leptospiruria in the face of therapy with doxycycline in four dogs and enrofloxacin in one dog. Leptospiruria was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing for pathogenic leptospires in all five dogs. In two dogs, leptospiruria resolved after a change in therapy to enrofloxacin. In three dogs, doxycycline and/or enrofloxacin were ineffective at eliminating leptospiruria, which then resolved after therapy with clarithromycin. Pet owners could be at risk as persistent leptospiruria poses a potential zoonotic risk.

The hormone melatonin has been shown to have significant anticonvulsant effects; epileptic humans have lower serum melatonin levels than unaffected individuals. We hypothesize that serum levels of melatonin will be lower in dogs with seizures as compared with normal dogs. Sixty-two dogs were enrolled in the study: 29 normal dogs (Group 1) and 33 dogs with seizures (Group 2). Blood sampling was done at three separate time points (8:00 a.m., 12:00, and 4:00 p.m.). The majority of dogs in Groups 1 (69%) and 2 (76%) had serum melatonin levels &lt;0.5 pg/mL as measured by radioimmunoassay. There were no significant differences in serum melatonin values between the groups or within groups when time of blood draw, length of sample freezing, time of day/year of sampling, or presence of anticonvulsant therapy were compared.

Lobular dissecting hepatitis should be considered as a differential in young dogs with precontrast hyperattenuating hepatic nodules on noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Amoxicillin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Proteins</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatic Encephalopathy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatitis, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lactulose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Omeprazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This retrospective study examined the tolerability and efficacy of the combination of 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4-carboxamide (dacarbazine) (DTIC) in a population of dogs with lymphoma resistant to a doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy protocol. Mitoxantrone was administered at 5 mg/m[2] IV over 10 min followed by DTIC at 600 mg/m[2] IV over 5 hr, every 3 wk. All dogs were treated with prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and metoclopramide. The frequency of grade 4 neutropenia was 18%, and 5% of dogs were hospitalized from sepsis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was uncommon. The overall response rate was 34% (15 of 44; 95% confidence interval 20-48%) for a median duration of 97 days (range 24-636 days, 95% confidence interval 44-150 days). Fourteen of 15 dogs who received mitoxantrone and DTIC as first rescue responded to treatment. Dogs who achieved complete remission to their initial L-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy protocol were more likely to respond to mitoxantrone and DTIC (23 versus 11%, P = .035). The combination of mitoxantrone and DTIC is a safe treatment option for resistant lymphoma in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dacarbazine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mitoxantrone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutropenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The patient had undergone extra-capsular stifle stabilization surgery 14 wk prior to treat ligament disease in the same knee. Laboratory testing and treatment for anemia, presumptive immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and possible hemostatic disorder was initiated. A persistent anemia, progressive thrombocytopenia, and the development of a firm swelling and neurologic impairment in the limb raised concerns for compartment syndrome (CS). A musculoskeletal ultrasound revealed a large aneurysm in the caudal thigh surrounded by abnormal muscle tissue. The patient underwent amputation of the limb and recovered without further complication. Pathology findings were consistent with the development of femoral CS secondary to a ruptured peripheral arterial aneurysm or a pseudoaneurysm. A consumptive thrombocytopenia and regenerative anemia were attributed to periodic or progressive thrombosis of the vessel and regional hemorrhage. Postoperative CS can develop in combination with peripheral arterial aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, and screening for vascular abnormalities as well as CS should be considered in complicated recovery from orthopedic surgery with compatible clinical signs including progressive soft tissue swelling, persistent anemia, and thrombocytopenia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Amputation, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aneurysm, False</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aneurysm, Ruptured</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Compartment Syndromes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stifle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombocytopenia</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

No sedation was obtained with ACE, and sedation scores were higher with ALF than with AA treatment. Compared with baseline, an increase in heart rate occurred after ACE, and all treatments caused a decrease in systemic arterial pressure. Decreased left ventricular internal dimension in diastole, end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle, stroke volume, and left atrial dimension were identified after AA. There were minimal changes in echocardiographic variables after ALF. Biochemical and blood gas analysis showed no significant changes after all treatments. Although the difference in quality of recovery between the AA and ALF treatment groups was insignificant, all cats treated with AA or ALF showed ataxia. The AA combination did not change the recovery score, and tremor and twitching were identified more frequently with AA than ALF. ALF had no significant effects on echocardiographic, biochemical, or blood gas variables.

Data on previous treatment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, diagnostic findings, surgical techniques, and outcomes was retrieved. Follow-up clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed immediately; &#8764;1, 2, and 6 mo postoperatively; and at annual follow-up examinations. The stress myelography demonstrated spinal cord dynamic compression in three of four dogs and change in size or shape of the SAD in all four. Two dogs who had SAD recurrences 4 and 13 mo after previous surgical dural fenestration, and one dog with no previous SAD treatment demonstrated long-term neurological improvement after vertebral stabilization (49, 77, and 126 mo). In two other dogs, recurrence of clinical signs was observed at the follow-up (8 and 12 mo). This case series suggested that repetitive spinal cord injury from the dynamic lesion appears to be one potential cause of thoracolumbar SADs. In cases with dynamic lesions confirmed by stress myelography, vertebral stabilization with conventional techniques is indicated to prevent SAD recurrence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myelography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Compression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy has been advocated for improving wound healing and pain reduction; however, robust clinical trials are lacking. The present prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated targeted PEMF therapy administered to 53 client-owned dogs who underwent hemilaminectomy for naturally occurring disk extrusion intervertebral disc disease. The dogs were randomized to receive either targeted PEMF (n = 27) or placebo treatment (n = 28). Wound healing, evaluated by visual analog score and wound evaluation scale, was significantly improved at 6 wk postoperatively in the treatment compared with the control group (P = .010 and .023, respectively). Pain medications were administered less frequently in dogs receiving PEMF treatment during the 7 day postoperative period compared with the control treatment group (P = .010) with codeine administered 1.8 times more frequently in the control group. No untoward effects were recorded in either treatment group. More frequent evaluation of outcome measures with larger patient numbers, as well as histologic samples, may be useful in future studies. Dogs receiving PEMF therapy following postoperative hemilaminectomy demonstrated improved wound scores at 6 wk and reduced mean number of owner-administered pain medications compared with the control group therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Double-Blind Method</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Field Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain, Postoperative</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Random Allocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Wound Healing</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

When these dogs undergo pituitary surgery and the tumor regrows there are few reports of subsequent treatments. A 7 yr old male Maltese diagnosed with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism developed seizures in conjunction with a large pituitary corticotroph adenoma and underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. After 3 yr of clinical remission, hypercortisolism recurred, and trilostane therapy was initiated. One year later, the dog developed new neurological signs and computed tomography revealed regrowth of a large pituitary mass that was then treated with radiation therapy. The dog lived disease-free for 3 more yr. At postmortem examination, a more aggressive pituitary neoplasm than the one examined at the time of surgery was found, which is suggestive of malignant transformation into a carcinoma despite the absence of convincing metastasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypophysectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pituitary Gland</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pituitary Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of the present study was to evaluate HTG as a mediator between endocrine diseases and pancreatitis in dogs. The study design was a retrospective case-control study. Medical records of dogs newly diagnosed with acutely presenting pancreatitis between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed for the presence or absence of hyperadrenocorticism (HAC), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. A matched case-control analysis was performed, and the association between endocrine diseases and pancreatitis was evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis. In dogs with pancreatitis, the odds of HAC (P &lt; .001) and DM (P &lt; .001) were 4.5 and 12.4 times that of dogs without pancreatitis, respectively. HTG significantly mediated the association between DM and pancreatitis but not between HAC and pancreatitis. Additional studies will be necessary to confirm these findings and to further elucidate the associations between endocrine diseases and pancreatitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertriglyceridemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypothyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Shampooing with chlorhexidine followed by dilute bleach rinses are often recommended, but household bleach can dry the skin and is unpleasant to use. A shampoo formulated with sodium hypochlorite and salicylic acid was evaluated as sole therapy for dogs with superficial pyoderma associated with S. pseudintermedius, including methicillin-resistant strains. Client-owned dogs were recruited based on positive culture for methicillin-resistant staphylococci or prior failure of pyoderma to respond to antibiotics. This prospective, open-label pilot study assessed the efficacy of the shampoo when used three times weekly for 4 wk. Dogs were evaluated at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk by cytology, clinical examination, and owner assessment. Digital images were also obtained. Baseline bacterial counts, clinical assessments and owner scores were significantly improved at 2 and 4 wk. Clients completing the study reported excellent lathering and dispersion, reduction in odor, and brightening of white and light coats. No owners reported skin dryness or other adverse events during the study. We conclude that this shampoo containing sodium hypochlorite in a vehicle that avoids skin drying is an effective treatment for canine pyoderma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Infective Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dosage Forms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methicillin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Methicillin Resistance</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Salicylic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sodium Hypochlorite</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Skin Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study involved eight privately owned adult greyhounds presenting with persistent A. caninum ova shedding despite previous deworming treatments. The dogs received a combination treatment protocol comprising topical moxidectin, followed by pyrantel/febantel/praziquantel within 24 hr. At 7-10 days posttreatment, a fecal examination monitored for parasite ova. Dogs remained on the monthly combination treatment protocol until they ceased shedding detectable ova. The dogs then received only the monthly topical moxidectin maintenance treatment. The dogs remained in the study for 5-14 mo with periodical fecal examinations performed. During the study, three dogs reverted to positive fecal ova status, with two being associated with client noncompliance. Reinstitution of the combination treatment protocol resulted in no detectable ova. Use of monthly doses of combination pyrantel, febantel and moxidectin appears to be an effective treatment for nonresponsive or persistent A. caninum ova shedding. Follow-up fecal examinations were important for verifying the presence or absence of ova shedding despite the use of anthelmintic treatment. Limitations of the current study include small sample size, inclusion of only privately owned greyhounds, and client compliance with fecal collection and animal care.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Ancylostoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ancylostomiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Combinations</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Therapy, Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Feces</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Eosinophilia was found on complete blood count, and the remaining blood work was normal. A trial treatment with clindamycin and anti-inflammatory prednisone did not result in improvement of clinical signs; therefore, the dog was euthanized. On histopathologic examination, cross sections of a 75 &#956;m wide nematode larva with a 5 &#956;m cuticle, prominent lateral cords, lateral alae, and coeloemyelian musculature were identified in a focally extensive region of cerebellar necrosis. The size and morphology of the parasites was most consistent with Baylisascaris procyonis. This case highlights a rare but important zoonotic disease that should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any dog exhibiting acute, progressive central nervous system signs, and peripheral eosinophilia. The index of suspicion should be elevated in dogs with an unknown deworming history and known or suspected exposure to raccoons. Because most anthelminthics have been shown to be effective against B. procyonis, annual deworming is recommended in the at-risk population to reduce the likelihood of aberrant migration and zoonosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascaridida Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ascaridoidea</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System Helminthiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An abdominal ultrasound revealed multifocal lesions throughout the liver, which were suspicious for intrahepatic metastasis, with no evidence of extrahepatic metastatic disease. Cytology indicated neoplasia of epithelial origin, with neuroendocrine neoplasia the primary suspicion. The patient was started on a maximally tolerated chemotherapy protocol of doxorubicin and metronomic cyclophosphamide. Stable disease was found on repeat abdominal ultrasounds, and the patient tolerated the protocol well. On completion of five doxorubicin doses, the dog was continued on metronomic cyclophosphamide and meloxicam. Progressive hepatic disease was found at 10 mo. The patient was euthanized 15.5 mo (465 days) after commencing treatment. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (synaptophysin) performed on liver collected postmortem indicated (primary) hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinomas are rare in dogs, and there is no standard of care for treatment.

One cat's signs progressed over 2 wk; the other cat progressed over 5 days. Examinations were consistent with a process involving the prosencephalon, vestibular system, and general proprioceptive/upper motor neuron systems. MRI of the brain and cervical spinal cord reveal widespread T2 hyperintensity of the white matter. Affected areas included the cerebrum, cerebral peduncles, corticospinal tracts of the pons and medulla, and the cerebellum. T2 hyperintensity was present in all funiculi of the spinal cord. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were consistent with cytotoxic or intramyelinic edema. Differential diagnosis included toxic or metabolic/degenerative leukoencephalopathies. Necropsies revealed widespread spongy degeneration of the central nervous system white matter. Toxicologic assays of liver specimens revealed desmethylbromethalin, a metabolite of bromethalin. Bromethalin is a rodenticide that causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Antemortem diagnosis is challenging. DWI and ADC maps were instrumental in narrowing the differential diagnosis and raised the index of suspicion for bromethalin. Bromethalin intoxication should be considered in all animals with a progressive course of multifocal neurologic deficits. MRI, specifically, DWI and ADC maps, may serve as a biomarker of cytotoxic or intramyelinic edema associated with spongiform leukoencephalomyelopathy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aniline Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodenticides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-one dogs undergoing prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy with a simple continuous barbed suture without incising the seromuscular layer of the stomach and transversus abdominis muscle were reviewed. In 20 cases, additional procedures were performed (18 ovariectomies and 2 prescrotal castrations); 1 dog had two prior episodes of gastric dilation without volvulus and underwent gastropexy with a prophylactic intent. The gastropexy procedure had a median duration of 33 min (range 19-43 min). V-Loc 180 absorbable and the V-Loc PBT nonabsorbable suturing devices were used in 8 and 13 dogs, respectively. Minor intraoperative complications occurred in four cases: broken suture (1), needle dislodgement (2), and folded needle (1). Minor complications included self-limiting wound complications (3), abdominal discomfort (2), vomiting (1), and inappetence (2). Postoperative abdominal ultrasound performed after a median of 8 mo (6-36 mo) confirmed permanent adhesion at the gastropexy site in all dogs. One dog developed a fistula (1 yr postoperatively) and another a granuloma (3 mo postoperatively), both at the gastropexy site.

Results were obtained from 300 completed surveys by 128 board-certified neurologists and 172 board-certified emergency and critical care (ECC) specialists. Case volume was slightly different between groups, with 36% of neurologists and 18% of ECC specialists managing &gt;50 cases of first-time canine seizure patients yearly. The initial AED of choice was similar between the groups, with 66% of neurologists and 64% of ECC specialists using phenobarbital and 16% of neurologists and 26% of ECC specialists using levetiracetam. Although most respondents gave a loading dose of phenobarbital, roughly one-fourth of neurologists did not load the drug versus 6% of ECC specialists. The total loading dose was similar between respondents (16 mg/kg) but varied in administration protocol. Approximately half of neurologists and nearly two-thirds of ECC specialists gave a higher initial dose of levetiracetam than recommended. Almost all the respondents who gave a higher initial dose of levetiracetam used 60 mg/kg IV once. Understanding the common practices in AED use may promote future discussions regarding best practices in the management of canine idiopathic epilepsy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anticonvulsants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Administration Schedule</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Emergency Medicine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Epilepsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurology</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical and imaging findings (acute onset and radiological evidence of lateralized disc material dispersed beyond the margins of the intervertebral disc space) allowed proper diagnosis of disc extrusion. Decompressive surgery via hemilaminectomy was performed in both patients with favorable outcomes. Intervertebral disc extrusions should be considered as a differential diagnosis of large-breed dogs with acute onset, upper-thoracic spinal cord disease.

Dogs &#8805;3 mo of age that visited any of 787 US hospitals at least twice from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012, were included. Survival curves were constructed for dogs by reproductive status, breed, body size, and purebreed (versus mixed-breed) status. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify factors associated with lifespan. There were 2,370,078 dogs included in the study, of whom 179,466 (7.6%) died during the study period. Mixed-breed dogs lived significantly longer than purebred dogs, and this difference was more pronounced as body size increased. Controlling for other factors, dogs of either sex had a greater hazard of death over the study follow-up period if sexually intact rather than gonadectomized.

An 8 yr old male neutered Scottish fold cat was presented for a mass on his hind paw. The mass caused decreased mobility in the metatarsal region and digits and resulted in significant discomfort. Because of extensive skeletal abnormalities attributed to breed-related osteochondrodysplasia, the owner was reluctant to pursue amputation. Radiation therapy was pursued for palliation of pain. After coarsely fractionated external beam radiotherapy resulted in stabilization of the mass with eventual progression after 14 mo, samarium-153-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetramethylene phosphonic acid was administered systemically, and the cat showed immediate, whole-body improvement in mobility. Concurrent intestinal and respiratory disease was evaluated and managed. Samarium-153-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetramethylene phosphonic acid administration was repeated approximately every 6 mo for three treatments until the cat succumbed to thromboembolic disease attributed to previously diagnosed cardiac disease. Radiation therapy administered using either external beam or bone-seeking radioisotopes can be effective at palliating clinical signs associated with the skeletal abnormalities that accompany this disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Organophosphorus Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteochondrodysplasias</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radioisotopes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Samarium</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>TRPV Cation Channels</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A commercial at-home urinalysis reagent strip kit using a smartphone app to evaluate free-catch urine is being marketed directly to dog and cat owners. We compared agreement between simultaneous urinalysis using the commercial kit and standard reference methods in 48 canine urines submitted to our referral laboratory. Agreement was defined by analyte based on clinical impact. Sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa evaluated categorical data, and a paired t test was used for continuous variables (significance P &lt; .05). The commercial kit had &#8805;1 disagreement with the reference method per sample and produced results if the test strip was absent or reversed. Specific gravity and pH concurred with the reference method in only 31% (P &lt; .011) and 27% (P &lt; .001) of cases, respectively. The sensitivity was low for all analytes except ketones, which had 77% false positives. False-positive nitrites and leukocytes were also frequent (36 and 19%, respectively). False negatives for blood (27%), nitrites (38%), and protein (54%) were common. This kit is inaccurate; its use for clinical decisions is not recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reagent Strips</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinalysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Serology testing is used commonly. Serum was collected from 35 atopic dogs and separated into three samples each (1, 2, and 3). Samples 1 and 2 were sent to IDEXX Laboratories the same day; sample 3 was stored at -80&#176;C and submitted &#8764;30 days later. Specific immunoglobulin type E reactivity to various allergens were determined using monoclonal anti-canine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as ELISA absorbance units. Percent difference ranged from 14.30 to 127.34% for samples 1 and 2. These values increased when comparing samples a month apart (21.78 to 129.65%). Between samples 1 and 2, for each allergen there were differences in interpretation 15.18% of the time; 32 of 35 dogs (91.4%) had at least one allergen with a different interpretation. Comparing sample 3 and the average of samples 1 and 2, differences in interpretation increased to 22.32%; all dogs had at least one allergen that was interpreted differently. These differences in interpretation can alter immunotherapy. Overall, results show the need for better reliability for allergen-specific immunoglobulin type E serology testing using monoclonal anti-canine ELISA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Allergens</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis, Atopic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypersensitivity, Immediate</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laboratories</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Observer Variation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reproducibility of Results</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serologic Tests</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to describe the occurrence and clinical features of carpal or tarsal ligament laxity in cases of nonerosive IMPA in dogs for the first time. Five client-owned dogs with a diagnosis of nonerosive IMPA and carpal or tarsal ligament laxity in which the influence of corticosteroids was excluded were identified. Medical records were reviewed, and data including signalment, investigative findings, and treatment regimen (e.g., surgical management) was extracted. Primary care practices were contacted to obtain follow-up, and the data was descriptively analyzed. The affected joints were either carpi and tarsi (n = 3) or carpi only (n = 2). In three cases, surgical arthrodesis was performed. Three dogs were euthanized (1 mo, 12 mo, and 5 yr) as a result of the severity of clinical signs and poor control. In the four dogs surviving &gt;6 mo, multiple episodes of relapse were recorded, and multimodal immunosuppression was needed. The prognosis for the dogs described was poor, with none achieving control of the disease without ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. Damage to soft-tissue periarticular structures may be related to prolonged clinical disease or a more severe presentation. Jaccoud's arthropathy in humans with systemic lupus erythematosus may represent a homologous presentation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Instability</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligaments</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Moral Judgment</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A standardized contrast videofluoroscopy technique was used to evaluate esophageal transit characteristics in dogs with ME while in an upright position. Twelve dogs with ME (congenital, acquired idiopathic, or secondary to myasthenia gravis) were placed in an upright position using Bailey chairs and given liquid barium, canned food meatballs, and their normal diet consistency if different than meatballs. Passage of ingesta was videofluoroscopically evaluated by direct observation and change in ingesta area as determined by manual tracing or barium column product calculations. Significant individual variation was seen. Complete esophageal clearance of liquid was seen in four dogs, and complete clearance of meatballs in three dogs, with a median time of 5 min for both. Two of seven dogs fed a slurry diet had complete clearance by 10 min. No significant difference was found between area calculated via tracing or barium column product. Based on imaging results, alterations in food consistency, duration upright, or medication were recommended for nine dogs. In dogs with ME accustomed to a Bailey chair, contrast videofluoroscopy was technically straightforward and allowed for more specific physician-guided management recommendations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Achalasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Motility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gravitation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A questionnaire was made available to primary care veterinarians to gather information on cases diagnosed with canine spontaneous HAC. Inclusion criteria were an adrenocorticotropic stimulation test and/or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test consistent with HAC. Exclusion criteria included concurrent systemic diseases, any clinical sign (CS) not typically associated with HAC, a urinary corticoid:creatinine ratio within reference interval, administration of steroids during the 3 mo before diagnosis, treatment with any drug causing CSs of HAC, and ongoing treatment for canine spontaneous HAC. Sixty-two cases were identified. The prevalences of various CSs were similar to those historically reported. No association between the patient weight and CSs was identified. The platelet count was negatively correlated to the weight (P = .005, r[2] = 0.3). Alanine aminotransferase (P = .016, r[2] = 0.17) and alkaline phosphatase (P = .05, r[2] = 0.0014) activities were positively correlated to the CS ratio. In this group of dogs, CSs were not significantly different between dogs &#8804;20 kg and dogs &gt;20 kg. The prevalences of various clinical findings appeared to be similar to those historically reported. Dogs with more CSs tended to have higher alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenal Cortex Hormones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Alanine Transaminase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Alkaline Phosphatase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Creatinine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

He had previously received hypofractionated radiation therapy for an amelanotic oral malignant melanoma (OMM) 7 mo prior to presentation. At presentation, the dog was gasping and dyspneic. Oral examination identified the OMM on the right hard palate. Thoracic radiographs revealed an angular soft-tissue opacity within the trachea just distal to the thoracic inlet. No evidence of pulmonary metastatic disease was seen. Tracheoscopy identified a pedunculated, nonpigmented mass within the lumen of the distal trachea near the carina. Treatment options were presented to the owners and included tracheal stenting or tracheal resection and anastomosis. Because of the poor prognosis, the owners elected humane euthanasia. Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of melanoma in the distal trachea; no other sites of OMM metastasis were identified. The cause of OMM development in the distal trachea in this case is suspected to have resulted from mechanical tumor cell seeding during endotracheal tube placement for general anesthesia 7 mo prior to presentation. Despite the reported rarity of mechanical tumor seeding, this potential complication warrants consideration in dogs with OMM.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Iatrogenic Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intubation, Intratracheal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melanoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mouth Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Seeding</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Data analyzed included signalment, histopathologic diagnosis, presence or absence of hemoperitoneum, breed associations, and survival times. In the current study, 44% (163/370) of dogs had nonneoplastic splenic lesions and 56% (207/370) had neoplastic lesions. Hemangiosarcoma was present in 27% (100/370) of splenic lesions. Hemoperitoneum was present in 31% (115/370) of dogs, and of this population, 66% (76/115) had malignant splenic lesions. The most common breeds were miniature schnauzers, dachshunds, and beagles, with beagles exhibiting a positive association with malignancy. The presence of hemoperitoneum was associated with malignancy. Distribution for nodular splenic lesions, correlation of hemoperitoneum to malignancy, and median survival time were similar to previous reports in large-breed dogs. Small-breed dogs who present with hemoperitoneum are 2.6 times more likely to have a diagnosis of a malignant splenic lesion. The most common small-breed dogs with nodular splenic lesions were miniature schnauzers, dachshunds, and beagles. Beagles and small-breed terriers were more likely to have malignant splenic lesions, and small-breed terriers were more likely to present with hemoperitoneum.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenic Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Parameters that were reviewed for an association with long-term outcome included signalment, clinical history, results of staging tests, tumor and surgical variables, and administration of adjunctive therapy. History of previous surgery, type of surgery performed, status of surgical margins, tumor location, and whether adjunctive therapy was performed were associated with tumor recurrence. The distal forelimb was the most common location reported overall (46/167 [27.5%]). Dogs with tumors located at the tail/perineum had the fastest recurrence rate, with a median disease-free interval of &#8764;16 mo (505 days). Tumor grade alone was not associated with recurrence (P = .069), but when analyzing tumor grade and margin, low-grade tumors with dirty margins had a significantly shorter time to recurrence than low-grade tumors with either clean or narrow margins. Tumor location should be considered when assessing the treatment plan and follow-up recommendations for any hemangiopericytomas. Aggressive initial surgical treatment is recommended when possible to reduce the chance of local tumor recurrence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Combined Modality Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease-Free Survival</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiopericytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenic Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 9 yr old, neutered male Maltese was presented for hematochezia of &#8764;36 h duration. The dog had a history of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that was well managed with prednisone and azathioprine. Initial evaluation was unremarkable except for increased rectal temperature and hematochezia on digital rectal examination. Abdominal radiographs revealed diffuse gas within the colonic wall consistent with pneumatosis coli. Scant-free air was also appreciated in the peritoneal and retroperitoneal cavities. The dog was managed for 4 days in hospital with broad spectrum antibiotic, anthelminthic, and gastroprotectant therapy. He received one session of hyperbaric oxygen therapy while in hospital. Repeat abdominal radiographs after 72 hr of medical management showed improvement of the pneumatosis coli. After 4 days of hospitalization, he was discharged with resolution of clinical signs. Pneumatosis coli is rarely diagnosed in dogs but should be considered in cases with clinical signs of colorectal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperbaric Oxygenation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pretreatment differentiation of these tumors using fine needle aspiration or biopsy is essential because lymphomas are treated medically, whereas TETs are treated surgically. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether thoracic radiographic findings can be used to aid clinicians in preliminarily differentiating the two tumor types before cytology or histopathology results become available. Medical records, available cytologic or histologic samples, and thoracic radiographs were evaluated for 62 dogs and 28 cats. Seventeen radiographic criteria were assessed by two examiners, and regression modeling was performed to test for significant predictors of tumor type. In dogs, CMMs with at least two well-defined radiographic margins on a lateral view and CMMs causing a rightward shift of the cardiac silhouette on a ventrodorsal or dorsoventral view were significantly more likely to be TETs than lymphomas (P &lt; .001 and P &lt; .01, respectively). No significant predictive variables were identified in cats. Radiographic findings do not eliminate the need for invasive sampling, but in dogs, they may guide the clinician in providing preliminary information to owners regarding the staging and therapeutic measures that may eventually be recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mediastinal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thymus Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Both dogs underwent single-phase contrast computed tomography (CT) to characterize the extent of the dermoid sinus prior to surgical excision. Soft tissue and bony abnormalities of the vertebral spine associated with the dermoid sinuses were confirmed in both dogs prior to surgery, demonstrating communication with the dura of the spinal cord. Surgical exploration and excision of the dermoid sinus was performed in each dog, including partial laminectomy. Both cases had resolution of the sinus and an uncomplicated recovery. These cases show that single-phase contrast CT was accurate in characterizing the extent of the dermoid sinus without adjunctive tests or more invasive diagnostics. Single-phase contrast CT should be considered as a preoperative method to characterize the extent of dermoid sinuses, avoiding the risks associated with myelography or fistulography and the expense of MRI.

Toceranib (TOC) phosphate represents a novel agent for the treatment of canine TCC. Thirty-seven dogs were identified who had received TOC for bladder tumor treatment. The TOC was generally well tolerated, although 56% of dogs had progression of azotemia while receiving TOC. A partial response to TOC was observed in 6.7% of dogs, and 80% of dogs had stable disease for a median duration of 128.5 days. Median time to progression was 96 days, and median survival time after the start of TOC was 149 days. There were no significant variables influencing time to progression or survival time in this group of dogs. This retrospective study suggests that TOC may be useful for the treatment of TCC. However, careful monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients with bladder tumors receiving TOC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Transitional Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Indoles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyrroles</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been previously reported to lower serum desmethylbromethalin levels in an asymptomatic dog, and repeated mannitol has been investigated in a laboratory setting, there are no published reports of successful treatment of symptomatic bromethalin toxicosis in dogs. A 9 yr old castrated male Norwich terrier was evaluated for obtunded mentation, seizures, cranial nerve deficits, and tetraparesis secondary to bromethalin toxicosis. The patient was treated with ILE, mannitol, and ginkgo biloba and returned to normal neurological function. Bromethalin exposure was confirmed by serum desmethylbromethalin levels. Previous literature indicates that the prognosis for patients who suffer from symptomatic bromethalin toxicosis is poor to grave, and the return to normal neurological function after severe toxicosis has not been reported. ILE, mannitol, and ginkgo biloba are readily available and relatively inexpensive, and in combination may be of benefit in symptomatic bromethalin intoxication.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aniline Compounds</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diuretics, Osmotic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ginkgo biloba</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mannitol</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plant Extracts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Poisoning</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rodenticides</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our aim was to explore the effects of this procedure using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) patch on arrhythmogenicity and right ventricular function. Four healthy beagles and one client-owned golden retriever with recurrent cardiac tamponade as a result of hemangiosarcoma were included. The four healthy dogs underwent right atrioventricular ePTFE patch graft reconstruction after complete resection of the right auricle. Right ventricular function and arrhythmia were evaluated using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tissue Doppler imaging on echocardiography and Holter electrocardiography, respectively, before and after surgery. The golden retriever underwent right atrioventricular ePTFE patch graft reconstruction followed by resection of the cardiac mass. None of the echocardiographic values, not involving systolic function, changed after surgery in the four healthy dogs. Transient arrhythmias tended to increase 1 day after surgery. The dog with recurrent cardiac tamponade exhibited more severe arrhythmia and required transient antiarrhythmic treatment for 3 days and survived the cardiac tamponade for 434 days after surgery. We showed that an ePTFE patch can serve as a suitable alternative material for right atrioventricular patch graft reconstruction, although transient arrhythmias may occur following surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiac Tamponade</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polytetrafluoroethylene</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ventricular Function</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In both cases, computed tomography revealed a voluminous nasal mass, which was later histologically identified as carcinoma, without cribriform plate involvement. Nasal hydropulsion was performed in both animals in sternal recumbency under general anesthesia. A Poole suction tip was inserted into the orad esophageal opening and adequacy of the endotracheal tube cuff inflation was checked. Sterile saline was forcefully infused into the obstructed nasal cavity to dislodge the tumor. Both patients had temporary resolution of clinical signs. Nasal hydropulsion was repeated as a palliative last-resort treatment at each clinical relapse (four times in both animals over &#8805;1 yr), allowing long-term survival. Minor complications included a self-limiting retrobulbar and oropharyngeal swelling in the cat and self-limiting epistaxis in both animals. Although this technique is not intended to represent an equivalent alternative to radiation or surgical therapies, nasal hydropulsion may represent an appropriate palliative, last-resort treatment in case of obstructive nasal tumors in dogs and cats, when radiation therapy or surgery is not affordable, available, or desired.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palliative Care</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Dogs were randomly assigned to the study group or the placebo-control group and administered oral melatonin or an oral inert tablet, respectively, for 28 days. Dogs in the study group were administered melatonin at 3 mg per os q 12 hr for dogs weighing &lt;15 kg and 6 mg per os q 12 hr for dogs weighing 15 kg or more. Complete blood counts were obtained at 0, 7, 14, and 28 days of medication administration. No adverse effects or sedation were noted in any dog. The placebo group had a statistically significant transient increase in both plateletcrit and mean platelet volume on day 7 relative to baseline, which was not observed in the melatonin group. Oral melatonin did not appear to have a direct thrombopoietic effect in normal healthy dogs. Future studies are required to investigate the pharmacokinetics of melatonin in dogs and the potential benefits of melatonin in both thrombocytopenia and immune-mediated diseases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Administration, Oral</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Platelets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Melatonin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our objective was to evaluate the function of the short lateral collateral ligaments (SLCLs) of the tarsocrural joint in 90&#176; flexion. Eight canine cadaveric limbs were tested for internal/external rotation and valgus/varus before and after transection of one or both SLCLs. In one group, the fibulocalcaneal ligament was transected first, followed by the fibulotalar. In the second group, the order of ligament transection was reversed. Angular changes between two k-wires were measured and compared. External rotation increased significantly after transection of one or both SLCLs (P = .009 and P &lt; .0005), as did varus (P = .021 and P = .001). Lateral subluxation was only possible when both SLCLs were cut. Unlike the long lateral collateral ligament, which stabilizes against deviation toward medial, both SLCLs are major stabilizers against subluxation toward lateral. This important difference must be considered in clinical patients with isolated rupture of the SLCLs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biomechanical Phenomena</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cadaver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligaments</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tarsus, Animal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Our objective was to evaluate the function of the short medial collateral ligaments (SMCLs) in 90&#176; flexion. Eight cadaveric limbs were tested for internal/external rotation and valgus/varus before and after transection of one or both SMCLs. In one group, the tibiocentral ligament was transected first, followed by the tibiotalar. In the second group, the order of transection was reversed. Angular changes between two k-wires were measured and compared. Internal rotation increased significantly after transection of one or both SMCLs (P = .015 and P = .004), with higher angular changes in the group in which the tibiotalar ligament was transected first (P = .003). Transection of this ligament alone was sufficient to cause caudomedial subluxation upon internal rotation. Valgus angulation increased after transection of one ligament (P = .022), but there was also an increase in varus angulation after transection of both ligaments (P = .027). Unlike the long medial collateral ligament, which stabilizes against deviation toward lateral, the SMCL stabilizes against subluxation toward medial, with the tibiotalar ligament being the major stabilizer in flexion.

Ultrasound and cystoscopic examination revealed innumerable, intraluminal, finger-like proliferations arising from the dorsal urinary bladder (UB) wall. Histological examination of mucosal biopsies obtained by cystoscopy was suggestive of granulomatous cystitis. The proliferative lesions were removed surgically and submitted for histological examination. The UB submucosa was heavily infiltrated by macrophages with periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasm exhibiting rare Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of malakoplakia. The puppy was prescribed with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The urinary signs disappeared despite the persistent UB wall thickening revealed by abdominal ultrasound. Urine culture performed during the ninth week of treatment showed a persistent infection by E coli resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The dog was switched to doxycycline but was then lost to follow-up. Malakoplakia is a chronic granulomatous inflammation well documented in humans. Its pathophysiology is not fully understood, but bacterial infection, immunodepression, and a defective lysosomal function may lead to the intracytoplasmic accumulation of partially degraded bacteria that can subsequently mineralize to form the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Malakoplakia should be suspected when UB mass lesions are identified in a young dog with bacterial cystitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Malacoplakia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The infection can cause various diseases including respiratory, neurologic, cardiac, dermatologic, and ocular disease as well as osteomyelitis in dogs and many other mammals. Obtaining a definitive diagnosis can be challenging. Serology is commonly used as a screening diagnostic test for disease, but both false-negative and false-positive results have been reported. Fifty-two cases of coccidioidomycosis diagnosed via histopathology were retrospectively evaluated. The sensitivity of serology in the study population was determined to be 87% for immunoglobulin G and 46% for immunoglobulin M. The cases were evaluated for an association between negative serology results and anatomic location of disease, but these variables were found to be independent. This study reports the sensitivity of serology for canine coccidioidomycosis and highlights the importance of using multiple diagnostic tests for definitive diagnosis of infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Coccidioidomycosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Serologic Tests</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This dog had an ovariohysterectomy as a puppy and did not experience any evidence of estrous until 4.5 yr later. The owner had been using a topical hormone replacement therapy (estradiol spray) twice daily for the duration of the dog's clinical signs of 1 yr. On presentation, the dog had truncal alopecia, comedones, enlarged vulva with a malodorous, and purulent discharge. Bloodwork showed a leukocytosis with a neutrophilia, d&#246;hle bodies, and moderate toxic changes. An abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged uterine stump with a thickened wall, ovoid projection cranially, and echogenic luminal contents. An exploratory laparotomy identified an enlarged cervical stump. Histopathology revealed chronic suppurative vaginitis with endometritis, necrosis, and intraluminal coccoid bacteria. The dog recovered well from surgery. A baseline estrogen level post operatively was measured at 56.4 pg/mL (&lt;50.0 pg/mL for a spayed bitch), at this time, the dog had been separated from the owner for 7 days. After surgery, the clinical signs disappeared, and the dog's dermatologic changes improved.

The objective of this study was to describe the management of those conditions with a modified triple tibial osteotomy (TTO) in nine dogs. Medical records of dogs who underwent a modified TTO were reviewed. The mean pre- and postoperative patellar tendon angles were 104.2&#176; and 92.9&#176;, respectively. The mean pre- and postoperative mechanical medial proximal tibial angles were 99.5&#176; and 91.5&#176;, respectively. Medial patellar luxation was present in five dogs (55.6%) and treated in all five dogs with a tibial crest transposition. Tibial torsion was grossly resolved in two dogs (22.2%). Perioperative distal tibial crest fracture was treated by pins and a figure-of-eight tension-band wire in five dogs (55.6%). One major (surgical site infection) and three minor postoperative complications were observed. At the last follow-up, seven dogs (77.8%) had no lameness, one dog (11.1%) had mild lameness, and one dog (11.1%) had moderate lameness. Radiographic evaluation showed good (2/9; 22.2%) to excellent (7/9; 77.8%) bone healing. The visual analog scale evaluation revealed good-to-excellent owner satisfaction. Cranial cruciate ligament rupture, tibial deformities, and medial patellar luxation are difficult to treat together.

The previously reported cases and the dog in this report had marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase concentrations, and liver histopathology consistently showed bridging fibrosis and biliary hyperplasia. The condition is most often diagnosed in humans during exploratory surgery, which was also the case in the previous three dogs reported with GA. Computed tomography (CT) or MRI is now recommended for diagnosis of the condition in humans, and this is the first report of CT findings in an affected dog diagnosed without surgery. Bile stasis and cholangiohepatits have been proposed as secondary pathologies in both humans and dogs with GA, and histopathology and CT findings in this case support those theories.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Congenital Abnormalities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gallbladder</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical parameters, urinalysis, and urine culture and sensitivity results were retrieved from the medical records of 208 dogs with positive urine cultures over a 3 yr period at the Louisiana State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Several groups were defined including dogs presented for primary care versus referred cases; simple UTI, complicated UTI, and pyelonephritis; dogs pretreated with antimicrobials; and dogs having an indwelling catheter in place prior to sampling. Nearly 80% of dogs had complicated UTI. Of all dogs, 70% had no documented clinical signs of lower urinary tract disease (LUTD), with 68% of them showing hematuria and/or pyuria. Based on clinical signs or urinalysis, 19% of all dogs had no evidence of lower UTI. In dogs without LUTD signs the most common comorbidities were immunosuppressive treatment and severely restricted mobility (23%). Chronic recurring UTI were present in 19% of dogs with LUTD signs. Distribution of bacterial species was comparable with the existing literature and not significantly different between clinical subgroups. Isolates from dogs pretreated with antimicrobials showed decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin.

A noteworthy change from the earlier guidelines is the division of the dog's lifespan into five stages (puppy, young adult, mature adult, senior, and end of life) instead of the previous six. This simplified grouping is consistent with how pet owners generally perceive their dog's maturation and aging process and provides a readily understood basis for an evolving, lifelong healthcare strategy. The guidelines provide the following recommendations for managing 10 health-related factors at each of the first four canine life stages: lifestyle effect on the patient's safety, zoonotic and human safety risk, behavior, nutrition, parasite control, vaccination, dental health, reproduction, breed-specific conditions, and a baseline diagnostic profile.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Husbandry</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Societies, Scientific</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Additional evidence is needed to evaluate the potential role of this procedure in veterinary medicine. The aim of the study was to describe the techniques used and evaluate the response to balloon dilation of benign urethral strictures in dogs. Medical records were reviewed from eight client-owned dogs who underwent balloon dilation of a benign urethral stricture over a 13 yr period in this retrospective case series. Clinical signs improved for five of eight dogs after a single balloon dilation during a follow-up period of 1 wk to 3 yr. After a second procedure, an additional dog demonstrated improvement for 5.5 yr. Adverse outcomes included urinary incontinence in two dogs and recurrent bacteriuria in four dogs. Findings suggest that balloon dilation is an effective, minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of benign urethral strictures in dogs. Urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and stricture recurrence are potential outcomes for dogs undergoing this procedure either as a result of the nature of the underlying disease or as a result of the procedure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Stricture</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31715111</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Gastric Dilatation Organoaxial Volvulus in a Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>A 9 yr old castrated male mixed-breed dog was presented for acute vomiting. Abdominal radiographs appeared to show a normal positioned stomach with marked gas dilation, which persisted despite frequent suctioning with a nasogastric tube. An abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly, malpositioning of the spleen, and the pyloroduodenal junction. A ventral midline celiotomy revealed an organoaxial gastric volvulus, rotating on the gastroesophageal, and pyloroduodenal junctions. The omentum was not overlying the stomach, typically seen in mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus. The body of the stomach was derotated with no evidence of gastric necrosis noted. The spleen was in the right cranial abdomen and returned to its normal anatomic position after derotation of the stomach. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged the next day. To the authors' knowledge, organoaxial gastric volvulus has not been reported in dogs. This is rare in humans but occurs most commonly in children &lt;5 yr of age associated with hernias. The recommended treatment is surgical in majority of cases. As a result of the unusual orientation of the stomach, the diagnosis of gastric dilatation-volvulus was challenging. Organoaxial gastric volvulus demonstrates the need for further imaging and evaluation in cases of persistent gas dilation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastric Dilatation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach Volvulus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>31715112</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Jejunal Lesion Identified at a Previous Anastomosis Site in a Dog Using Capsule Endoscopy.</Title>	<Abstract>A 3 yr old spayed female French bulldog was evaluated for a progressive regenerative anemia of unknown origin that was unresponsive to empiric immunosuppressive and gastroprotective therapy. The patient had a history of previous resection and anastomosis of a small intestinal diverticulum &#8764;2 yr prior to evaluation for her anemia. Capsule endoscopy revealed a focal abnormality in the distal jejunum at the site of a previous bowel resection and anastomosis. This lesion was suspected to be the cause of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Exploratory laparotomy combined with endoscopy was performed to further investigate and localize the jejunal lesion. The lesion was resected, and a primary end-to-end jejunal anastomosis was performed. Histopathology of the specimen revealed jejunal suture granulomas with focal ulceration. The patient recovered well from surgery with significant improvement of the anemia and resolution of clinical signs at recheck examinations 1 and 2 wk postoperatively. Complete resolution of the anemia was noted at a 6 wk follow-up. The case report demonstrates how, in cases of unknown causes of anemia, capsule endoscopy is a noninvasive method of identifying the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding as a result of lesions that might otherwise not be detectable with abdominal ultrasound or conventional endoscopy. The report also documents a long-term complication to a resection and anastomosis surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Capsule Endoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diverticulum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Jejunum</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Ninety-nine dogs diagnosed with nonstructural ME were included. Congenital idiopathic ME was present in 10 cases, with complete resolution of clinical signs in a single case. Eighty-nine cases were considered acquired, with most cases being either idiopathic (42.7%) or associated with myasthenia gravis (38.2%). Idiopathic cases represented a smaller percentage of acquired ME than previously reported. Death or euthanasia directly related to ME occurred in almost 50% of acquired cases, whereas clinical signs persisted in &#8764;20% of cases and resolved in 30% of cases. A diagnosis of an underlying etiology, in particular myasthenia gravis, was associated with a better outcome in acquired ME. ME continues to be a challenging condition to manage, with a guarded-to-poor prognosis, particularly when an underlying etiology is not identified. Thorough diagnostic testing for an underlying neurological disorder is important in cases with ME as this may allow institution of appropriate treatment and the potential for a better prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Achalasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

West Highland white terriers were over-represented. Mean age of the dogs at presentation was 38.6 mo, and mean duration of clinical signs associated with esophageal foreign bodies was 5.8 days. A TG was performed via an eighth or ninth left intercostal thoracotomy, and clinical results were successful in 12 dogs. In 1 dog, gastrotomy failed to retrieve a foreign body and esophagotomy was performed. Foreign bodies that were removed included 3 fishhooks and 10 animal bones. Postoperatively, all dogs developed esophagitis, 1 dog showed esophageal stricture, and 1 dog died of pyothorax associated with esophageal perforation 1 day postsurgery. Overall, 12 dogs survived and were free of clinical signs after a median follow-up time of 17 mo. TG is an effective surgical technique for the retrieval of distal esophageal foreign bodies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

<Rec><Common><PMID>31715116</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Effect of Insulin and Fasting Regimen on Blood Glucose Concentrations of Diabetic Dogs During Phacoemulsification.</Title>	<Abstract>This study aimed to compare four protocols for preanesthetic insulin administration and fasting time with respect to the variation of intraoperative blood glucose (BG) concentrations versus preanesthetic values (baseline). The patient records of dogs undergoing cataract surgery were included. Data on anesthetic protocols, comorbidities, and intraoperative complications (hyper- and hypoglycemia, hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia) were analyzed. The insulin/fasting protocols included (A) 12 hr fasting and half insulin dose, (B) 6 hr fasting and half insulin dose, (C) 12 hr fasting and full insulin dose, and (D) 12 hr fasting and no insulin. Forty-eight dogs were included (14 in A, 10 in B, 13 in C, and 11 in D). Protocol D resulted in a significant increase of intraoperative BG concentrations compared with baseline (P = .001), whereas in the remaining groups, the baseline BG did not differ from intraoperative values. There were no statistically significant associations between the treatment group and the occurrence of intraoperative complications or the presence of diagnosed comorbidities. In conclusion, different insulin and fasting regimen protocols may be used for diabetic patients with no apparent benefit or risk from one protocol versus another. The use of insulin before surgery results in lesser increase of BG intraoperatively as compared with preanesthetic values. However, whether this should be interpreted as better perioperative control of glycemia remains debatable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Glucose</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Food Deprivation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Insulin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Phacoemulsification</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Three months earlier, a small stone embedded in the right parotid duct was noted and removed through a ductal incision by the referring veterinarian. At referral, the dog's general physical condition was normal except for a cylindrical mass on the right cheek. Skull radiographs showed a possibly retained sialolith or dystrophic mineralization within the previous surgical site. Aspiration of the mass yielded a thick, yellow/tan, mucopurulent fluid. Cytology of the fluid demonstrated degenerative neutrophils without bacteria. The cylindrical mass was excised with a carbon dioxide laser. The caudal end of the mass was connected to the parotid salivary gland and the rostral one-third of the mass tapered to a point. The caudal end of the mass was ligated with 3-0 polydioxanone and excised immediately rostral to the ligation. Histopathology revealed that the mass was parotid duct ectasia. The dog completely recovered with some mild temporary facial paresis and had no recurrence of parotid duct ectasia at 4 mo follow-up. The case report describes a dog with an unusual parotid salivary duct ectasia caused by parotid duct sialolith removal.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dilatation, Pathologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parotid Gland</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Serum biochemistry, complete blood count, and physical examination were unremarkable apart from the cervical swelling. Serosanguinous fluid was drained from the cyst-like structure; however, the mass returned. Computed tomographic imaging revealed a large rounded-to-oval-shaped cystic structure in the region of the right thyroid gland with no obvious metastatic changes to the pulmonary parenchyma. The mass was surgically excised, and the tissues were histologically consistent with thyroid carcinoma. No evidence of recurrence or metastasis was present 6 mo postoperatively. Thyroid carcinomas are rarely reported in domestic cats; consequently, there is little research available on the topic. Until more research is made available, veterinarians may look to information available in canine literature to guide their treatment plans, but no definitive statements regarding therapy and ultimate prognosis can be made.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroid Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

After amputation of the left hindlimb and debridement of the necrotic footpads on the right hindlimb, the remaining pads were insufficient for ambulation. The complete carpal pads and the peripheral, nonweight-bearing portions of the second and fifth digital pads of both forelimbs were harvested for pad grafting. All segments were sutured on the cutaneous trunci muscle in the predetermined location of the right abdominal wall for the pouch flap. After detaching the flap, the grafted segments were gradually strengthened, and the dog was able to regain ambulation. When considering pad grafting, the entire carpal pad and crescent-shaped segments from the nonweight-bearing surfaces of digital pads are excellent candidates for free grafts without compromising the ambulation of other limbs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foot Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plastic Surgery Procedures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Cytology of fine-needle aspirates of the mass was inconclusive, so exploratory celiotomy was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. An enlarged, hemorrhagic papillary process of the caudate lobe was identified, with twisting of the vasculature at the hilus, so a complete lobectomy was performed using a thoracoabdominal stapler.

This retrospective study determines the complications and outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation of coxofemoral luxations using a toggle rod stabilization in 58 dogs. The purpose of the study was to compare the results with previous studies to ascertain commonalities and differences. A majority of the canine luxations were stabilized using a 4.0 or 3.2 mm commercial toggle rod and either one or two strands of OrthoFiber, FiberWire, or monofilament nylon suture. Postoperative complications developed in 25 of the 58 (43%) dogs, with major complications in 9 cases (15.5%). The most common major complication was reluxation, which occurred in 6 dogs (10%). Five of the 6 cases of reluxation received monofilament suture, although there was not a statistically significant relationship between suture type and reluxation. Owner responses to a questionnaire reported good to excellent results for satisfaction with the procedure in 90% of cases. Results of the present study suggest that toggle rod stabilization remains an effective method for the treatment of coxofemoral joint luxation in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Nails</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hip Dislocation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ownership</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MRI studies of 49 dogs with trigeminal neuropathy were blindly reviewed and were classified into the following three groups: neoplasia, neuritis, or idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy (ITN). Thirty-one percent were suspected to have neoplasia (all unilateral), 16% to have neuritis (1 bilateral and 7 unilateral), and 53% to have ITN (4 unilateral and 22 bilateral). Dogs with clinical bilateral trigeminal dysfunction were most likely to have a diagnosis of ITN (predicted probability 95.7%). Unilateral clinical signs were significantly associated with neoplasia or neuritis compared with ITN (P &lt; .001 and P = .002, respectively). Even with marked brainstem neoplastic involvement, central neurological deficits may be absent. Sensory impairment was significantly associated with either neoplasia or neuritis compared with ITN (P = .007 and P = .03, respectively). Ipsilateral noninfectious middle ear effusion was only seen in dogs with neoplasia (33%). Horner's syndrome was present in 12% of all dogs (2 dogs in each group). Dogs with neoplasia were significantly older than dogs with neuritis (P = .02) and ITN (P = .002).

Single-port laparoscopy (SPL) is an alternative to ventral midline laparotomy for treatment of ORS. Medical records of 13 client-owned female dogs who underwent SPL for the treatment of ORS were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate surgical technique and outcome. Dogs who had undergone a previous attempt at open ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy were included. Major intraoperative complications did not occur and conversion to open laparotomy was not required. In 1 dog, an SPL + 1 technique was used, in which an additional port was placed cranial to the single-port device to aid in dissection and tissue manipulation. Median surgical time was 45 min (range, 30-90 min). Clinical signs related to estrus had resolved in 11 of 13 dogs with a median follow-up time of 18 mo. Two of 13 dogs were lost to follow-up at 3 mo postoperatively; however, signs of estrus had resolved at time of last follow-up. SPL treatment for ORS was feasible and successful in this cohort of dogs. Reduced surgical time was found in this study compared with previous reports investigating multiple-port laparoscopic treatment of ORS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cohort Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparotomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovarian Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Canine HSA arising from the falciform fat/ligament represents a rare anatomic variant, with only two reports in the veterinary literature. In this study, we describe the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of seven dogs with primary HSA of the falciform ligament. Histologic grade and mitotic score were not significantly associated with outcome. All dogs had the primary tumor surgically excised except for one diagnosed at necropsy. Median overall survival for all dogs diagnosed prior to necropsy was 339 days, and the 1 yr survival rate was 50%. Four dogs were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and had a significantly longer median overall survival (394 versus 83 days) than those that did not (P = .018). Dogs with HSA of the falciform ligament may have improved 1 yr survival rates and longer median survival time compared with dogs with HSA in more common visceral locations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Round Ligament of Liver</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The metastatic rate of sinonasal osteosarcoma (OSA) is not well characterized, and reported outcomes of these patients are variable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome and metastatic behavior of canine sinonasal OSA. Medical records of canine patients diagnosed with sinonasal OSA via histopathology between January 2005 and December 2015 were reviewed. Patients with any form of treatment or no treatment were included. Time to local progression, time to metastasis, and overall survival data were evaluated. Variables that may impact outcome, such as tumor stage and treatment type, were evaluated. Twenty-seven dogs were identified that fit the inclusion criteria. Overall, 30.0% of dogs developed metastasis over the disease course, with a median time to metastasis of 458 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 318-758 days). The median time to local progression was 335 days (95% CI 264-544 days). The overall median survival time was 410 days (95% CI 341-627 days). Regarding metastasis, sinonasal OSA behaves similarly to sinonasal neoplasms of other histologies and dissimilarly to appendicular OSA. The outcome of treated patients appears similar to that of sinonasal tumor patients with other histologies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nose Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Skin histopathology revealed transepidermal keratinocyte apoptosis with lymphocyte satellitosis and lymphocytic and histiocytic interface infiltrate. Histopathology combined with clinical signs and history were compatible with the diagnosis of erythema multiforme major. Treatment was initiated with multidrug immunosuppression. Following 36 hr with no improvement, intravenous human immunoglobulin (0.45 mg/kg IV) was administered resulting in notable improvement in the dog's attitude and appetite within 2 hr and the dog's skin lesions within 48 hr. Following discharge, the dog improved daily with near complete resolution of dermatologic disease achieved 1 mo postdischarge.

Medical records of 65 canine and feline patients who underwent thoracic surgery were evaluated. Dogs and cats who underwent thoracotomy and had a chest drain placed intraoperatively were included. Data retrieved from medical records included signalment, body weight, diagnosis, surgical approach, surgical procedure, type of thoracostomy drain, postoperative analgesia, duration of thoracostomy drain, and postoperative complications. The incidence of complications and number of medications used in pain protocols were compared among types of thoracostomy drains. JP (n = 31), TRO (n = 25), and GW (n = 9) thoracostomy drains were placed in 65 patients. Ten minor (15.3%) and four major (6.2%) complications occurred. Cases with JP thoracostomy drains were significantly less likely to have complications (2 minor, 1 major) than cases with TRO thoracostomy drains (8 minor, 3 major, P = .009).

A narcolepsy-cataplexy episode with associated hypertension and bradycardia was triggered during examination. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the episode. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were compatible with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affecting the mesencephalon, pons and rostral medulla oblongata. The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities. Although very rare, symptomatic narcolepsy/cataplexy can occur in dogs and can be secondary to brainstem encephalitis. Cardiovascular changes can occur in association with narcolepsy/cataplexy and should be considered when dealing with patients presenting with these specific clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Brain Stem</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cataplexy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningoencephalitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Narcolepsy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, the use of guidelines, checklists, and training can decrease the risk of anesthesia-related adverse events. These tools should be used not only during the time the patient is unconscious but also before and after this phase. The framework for safe anesthesia delivered as a continuum of care from home to hospital and back to home is presented in these guidelines. The critical importance of client communication and staff training have been highlighted. The role of perioperative analgesia, anxiolytics, and proper handling of fractious/fearful/aggressive patients as components of anesthetic safety are stressed. Anesthesia equipment selection and care is detailed. The objective of these guidelines is to make the anesthesia period as safe as possible for dogs and cats while providing a practical framework for delivering anesthesia care. To meet this goal, tables, algorithms, figures, and "tip" boxes with critical information are included in the manuscript and an in-depth online resource center is available at aaha.org/anesthesia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anesthesia, General</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animal Welfare</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Monitoring, Physiologic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinary Medicine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study evaluated data from 11 dogs including 5 with macroscopic tumors that were treated in the primary setting and 6 that underwent aggressive local therapy while being treated in the adjuvant setting. The median ACNU starting dose was 25 mg/m[2] (range, 20-30 mg/m[2]; 3- to 5-wk intervals, 1-8 administrations). The median overall survival in the primary and adjuvant settings was 120 days (median progression-free survival [PFS], 63 days) and 400 days (median PFS, 212 days), respectively. Neutropenia was observed in eight cases (grade 1, n = 1; grade 2, n = 2; grade 3, n = 2; grade 4, n = 3) with nadir neutrophil count at 1 wk after ACNU administration. Mild gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 1-2) was observed in three cases. ACNU was well tolerated and showed a similar outcome to that seen for lomustine, which is a drug commonly used to treat canine HS, in terms of overall survival and PFS in the current study population. Further investigations will need to be undertaken to definitively determine if ACNU is an appropriate alternative to lomustine for the treatment of HS.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Histiocytic Sarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutropenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nimustine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Histopathology revealed a poorly differentiated, moderately well-demarcated, unencapsulated, highly infiltrative round cell neoplasm, and immunohistochemistry was supportive of a plasmacytoma. Performance of a rostral partial mandibulectomy was initially discussed with the owners, but the lesion improved spontaneously both clinically and on repeated computed tomography scanning before surgery could be performed.

MRI appearance of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis has been described in horses, and the use of MRI has been proposed as a diagnostic alternative to radiographs to allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment. MRI is also routinely used in human medicine for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis owing to increased accuracy of evaluation of the soft tissue involvement. In the case of a 5 mo old male boxer dog described here, radiographs were suggestive of the diagnosis of septic physitis, although an MRI was obtained to rule out neurologic etiologies of lameness based on history and physical exam findings. MRI identified a fluid pocket communicating with the physis. The diagnosis of septic physitis was then confirmed via ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate of the fluid pocket communicating with the physis that was seen on the MRI.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthritis, Infectious</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humerus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Development of a suspected secondary infection, with subsequent discovery of an unexpectedly high level of T-cell suppression despite a relatively low cyclosporine dose, prompted an investigation into the cause of possible excessive immunosuppression. Blood cyclosporine concentrations were within expected target ranges, and the dog was determined to be heterozygous for the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1; ATP-binding cassette sub family B member 1-1&#916;) gene mutation. The MDR1 mutation was suspected to have contributed to the excessive immunosuppression experienced by this patient. This case highlights the need to monitor immunosuppressive therapy in the individual patient, especially when the patient is not responding to therapy at typical dosages or when secondary infections develop at dosages lower than expected to cause significant immunosuppression. Pharmacodynamic monitoring can be used to help identify unexpected excessive immunosuppression in dogs receiving cyclosporine, and MDR1 genotyping should be further explored as a potential method of predicting and preventing its occurrence.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anemia, Hemolytic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclosporine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppression Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mutation</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The survey response rate was 10% (89/867). Approximately half (43%) of respondents had LLLT units, of which all used LLLT for OA treatment in dogs. In respondents without LLLT units, 20% referred patients for LLLT OA treatment. Training was most often obtained in-house by a representative of the LLLT unit manufacturer (76%). Treatment dose was largely unknown and chosen by predetermined settings on the LLLT unit (65%). In the majority of patients (84%), no treatment site preparation was performed. An average of four patients with OA were treated per wk with an average cost per treated joint of $28 (range: $15-45). This study provides insight into the current clinical use and estimated annual economic impact ($6.2 million per year) of treating a single OA joint in dogs with LLLT by Missouri veterinarians. The frequency with which LLLT is used in the treatment of OA combined with the variation in training and treatment protocols supports the need for further research regarding the application and efficacy of LLLT in dogs with OA.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Low-Level Light Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Missouri</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoarthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Practice Patterns, Physicians'</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surveys and Questionnaires</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Veterinarians</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A 10 yr old female intact mixed-breed dog was presented with a 7 mo history of vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination revealed abdominal discomfort. Ultrasonography and endoscopy identified a submucosal gastric mass. Excision was performed by partial gastrectomy and histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed a T-cell IVL. The owner declined chemotherapy, and the dog was instead treated palliatively with prednisolone. Two months after surgery, vomiting recurred and abdominal ultrasonography revealed a large gastric ulcer with focal peritonitis. The dog was euthanized 4 mo after initial presentation and postmortem examination confirmed IVL recurrence in the stomach and an isolated nodule of neoplastic cells in the omentum. No involvement of other organs was found following histopathological examination.

The authors present an alternative to established flexible and rigid endoscopic approaches when case limitations require such an approach. In seven dogs, after the identification of a mass on physical exam and computed tomographic evaluation, the colorectum was accessed using obturator-assisted prolapse to isolate discrete masses and perform shielded sampling via core needle biopsy. Histopathologic diagnosis was adequate for treatment planning in all dogs. No major complications were recorded 65-475 days after the procedure. This technique may be useful when traditional endoscopy and surgery for biopsy of colorectal masses is unavailable.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colorectal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Specimen Handling</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The cat had experienced bacterial cystitis and constipation since weaning. Contrast referral images revealed an enlarged colon with a patent anus. Clinical examination revealed an anogenital cleft with a common anovulvar orifice. The rectum was patent upon digital rectal palpation, and fecal contamination of the vulva was present. Abdominal radiographs revealed two distinct colons, both filled with a moderate amount of formed fecal material. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed segmental duplication of the descending colon with a dominant right colon and a smaller accessary left colon. The two structures conjoined at the transverse colon proximally and at the pubic brim distally. A common anogenital orifice with anovulvar communication was also noted. The anogenital cleft malformation was successfully repaired surgically. A celiotomy was performed to remove the smaller accessory colon. An ovariectomy and partial hysterectomy were also performed.

However, there is a paucity of contemporary literature to support these assertions. The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to report the prevalence, clinical presentation, and long-term follow-up of cholelithiasis in dogs. The electronic database at the Small Animal Hospital, University of Glasgow was searched to identify dogs that were diagnosed with cholelithiasis on ultrasound between 2010 and 2018. Sixty-eight dogs were identified, giving an overall prevalence of cholelithiasis in our hospital of 0.97% (confidence interval 0.76-1.22%). Medical records of 61 dogs were available for review. Cholelithiasis was classified as an incidental finding in 53 (86.9%) dogs, with 8 (13.1%) dogs being classified as symptomatic, having complications of cholelithiasis that included biliary duct obstruction, biliary peritonitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, and acute cholecystitis. Follow-up was available for 39 dogs, with only 3 dogs (7.7%) developing complications attributed to cholelithiasis, including biliary duct obstruction and acute cholecystitis, within the subsequent 2 yr. Cholelithiasis is an uncommon but frequently incidental finding in dogs. Within the follow-up period, few of the dogs with incidental cholelithiasis went on to be become symptomatic.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cholelithiasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prevalence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Scotland</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Exposure to Ehrlichia spp. was defined as having an Ehrlichia spp. antibody-positive result recorded at any point in their available patient history. The outcome of CKD was defined as concurrent increased symmetric dimethylarginine (&gt;14 &#181;g/dL) and creatinine (&gt;1.5 mg/dL) for a minimum of 25 days with inappropriate urine specific gravity (&lt;1.030). Patients were matched using propensity score matching to control for age, geography, and breed. A total of 22,440 patients and controls in E canis-endemic regions of the United States were used in this analysis. Contingency tables were used to compare dogs with and without exposure to Ehrlichia spp.-infected ticks and CKD outcome. The relative risk of CKD for patients exposed to ticks carrying Ehrlichia spp. was found to be 2.12 (95% confidence interval [1.35-3.15], p &lt; 0.0006).

However, to date, there is no single effective treatment that can be used to treat all cats with Scottish Fold osteochondrodysplasia (SFOCD). A 4 yr old castrated Scottish Fold cat presented with plantar exostoses in the right hindlimb, the largest of which was caudal to the tarsometatarsal joint and had stretched the overlying skin, causing ulceration and bleeding. There was right hindlimb lameness. The cat was diagnosed with SFOCD, and the skin lesions were treated by excision of the exostoses, removal of the damaged skin, and wound closure. All extremities were treated with radiotherapy and subcutaneous pentosan polysulfate for chronic pain. The cat's gait improved after surgery, and increased activity was noted after radiotherapy. There were no signs of excessive bone proliferation or adverse effects at 80 wk postoperatively. In conclusion, a combination of surgical, radiation, and medical therapies could be an effective treatment strategy for SFOCD with skin ulceration.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Combined Modality Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hindlimb</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteochondrodysplasias</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Examination revealed pain and effusion in multiple appendicular joints and pyrexia. Clinicopathologic testing revealed moderate neutropenia as well as nondegenerate neutrophilic inflammation in multiple joints. Radiographs showed capsular joint swelling and heterogeneous metaphyseal lucencies in the distal radius, ulna, femur, and tibia. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13B gene and a diagnosis of trapped neutrophil syndrome (TNS). Within 24 hr of initiating prednisone therapy (1 mg/kg, per os, q 12 hr), the dog was afebrile and nonpainful with normal ambulation. Lameness recurred twice over the next 5 mo. At 9 mo of age, diagnostics showed severe erosive polyarthritis of both stifles with an inflammatory leukogram and arthrocentesis findings consistent with septic arthritis, and the dog died despite antibiotic therapy. This is the first case of TNS described in the North American literature, and it is unique in that we had the opportunity to document progression of radiographic abnormalities over more than 6 mo. TNS should be considered in young border collies with signs suggestive of immune-mediated polyarthritis, septic arthritis, or hypertrophic osteodystrophy, combined with neutropenia or gastrointestinal signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arthritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lameness, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neutropenia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vesicular Transport Proteins</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) infusion was initiated, with reduction in tremoring and improved patient mentation being noted after &#8764;20 min of therapy. An elevated cardiac troponin I value measured at 1.02 ng/mL the day after presentation. Serum toxicological assay revealed marked reduction in serum lamotrigine levels following ILE and continued reduction during hospitalization. The dog's clinical signs resolved, corrected QT interval returned to normal, and the patient was discharged 38 hr after presentation. Individual cases of lamotrigine toxicosis have not been fully reported in veterinary literature.

This study evaluated a novel training program teaching handlers to administer naloxone to their LEK9 in the event of an overdose. Seventy-five LEK9 handlers from a governmental agency attended a naloxone training session. A presurvey given to the handlers evaluated their knowledge of opioid overdose in LEK9s and their confidence administering naloxone. Officers were educated via a PowerPoint presentation about naloxone and how to administer it to their LEK9. A postsurvey evaluated changes in their knowledge and confidence as a result of the presentation. Sixty-two presurveys and 47 postsurveys were completed. Nearly all handlers had never given their LEK9 an intramuscular or intranasal injection. Most handlers were not comfortable monitoring their LEK9's vital signs for an opioid overdose. After the training, handlers demonstrated a mild increase in comfort level administering intramuscular and intranasal naloxone (15 and 14% increase, respectively). Comfort level monitoring vital signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose increased 38 and 32%, respectively. Handlers may not be fully prepared to assess and treat their LEK9 and may benefit from a targeted training program teaching them to administer naloxone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Administration, Intranasal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Intramuscular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Law Enforcement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Naloxone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Narcotic Antagonists</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Opiate Overdose</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A caudal auricular axial pattern flap was used for reconstruction, and its margin was sutured to only the medial and lateral canthus in two cats; in the third cat, a narrow strip of spared conjunctiva was sutured to the flap margin. Postoperatively, superficial corneal ulcers occurred in two cats, but they healed with topical treatment. Apart from a reduced ability to blink, no further functional deficits persisted, and the long-term cosmetic appearance was considered satisfactory by the owners. Tumor-free excisional margins were achieved in two cases. Tumor recurrence in the long-term was observed for two cats, 350 and 380 days after surgery, one of whom had excisional noninfiltrated margins on histologic examination. UE reconstruction to preserve eyelid function following tumor excision without exenteration is challenging. In selected cases, caudal auricular axial pattern flap is one of the surgical options available to reconstruct the defect resulting from en bloc UE removal without any replacement of the mucosal layer.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eyelid Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eyelids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Plastic Surgery Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Flaps</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A positive-contrast retrograde urethrogram identified diffusely irregular margins of the urinary bladder but no active leakage of urine into the peritoneal cavity. An abdominal ultrasound identified severe thickening and loss of wall layering of the apex of the bladder. The dog was initially managed with an indwelling urinary catheter; however, when the catheter was removed 5 days later, the dog developed a recurrent uroabdomen after an episode of dysuria. Subsequent surgical exploration identified numerous (&gt;5), small (1-2 cm), black cyst-like nodules within the bladder wall at the apex of the bladder. A partial cystectomy, removing approximately 65% of the cranial bladder, was performed. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the bladder identified hemangiosarcoma of the bladder wall with chronic neutrophilic and hemorrhagic cystitis. The dog recovered from surgery without major complication and is still alive 9 mo following surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of successful treatment of canine bladder hemangiosarcoma by partial cystectomy in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemangiosarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records of 43 client-owned dogs were retrospectively reviewed, and follow-up information was gathered via phone or follow-up examination. Progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free interval (DFI), and overall survival were calculated. Forty-two and twenty-two dogs, respectively, had grade 2 (Patnaik grading system) or low-grade tumors (two-tier grading system). Median PFS was 1474 days. Median DFI was not reached at &gt;1968 days. Overall median survival time was not reached at &gt;1968 days. In univariate analysis, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and mitotic index were negatively prognostic for PFS whereas Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and microvessel density were negatively prognostic for DFI. In multivariate analysis, AgNORs remained negatively prognostic for PFS. Results suggest that proliferation indices, especially AgNORs, may be useful in predicting the rare poor outcomes in dogs with subcutaneous MCTs. The vast majority of subcutaneous MCTs appear to be low or intermediate grade with excellent outcomes from good local tumor control.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antigens, Nuclear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mastocytoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Soft Tissue Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Initial examination findings were mild pelvic limb ataxia and moderate right pelvic limb lameness. A computed tomography with a myelogram was performed and showed a suspected intramedullary spinal mass. MRI was conducted and supported the computed tomography with myelogram findings of a possible intradural spinal mass at L1. A left-sided hemilaminectomy followed by a durotomy at L1 was performed and a firm, tan mass was removed. The histopathologic findings indicated a vascular proliferation most suggestive of a rare proliferative disorder of leptomeningeal blood vessels termed meningioangiomatosis. Although the dog's signs initially worsened after surgery and he was nonambulatory with marked paraparesis, he regained ambulation within 3-4 wk after the operation. Eighteen months after surgery, he was ambulatory with mild hind limb ataxia with no progression of signs. This case suggests that surgical resection of lesions of suspected meningioangiomatosis can result in improvement of clinical signs with a good long-term prognosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lumbar Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningeal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thoracic Vertebrae</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This study's objective was to define the maximally tolerated dose and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of oxaliplatin in cancer-bearing dogs. This was a prospective, single-patient-cohort, dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin in client-owned dogs with confirmed, spontaneous malignancy. A single infusion was administered; the starting dose was 50 mg/m[2], with 10 mg/m[2] escalation-increments if no DLT was documented, up to a maximum dose of 140 mg/m[2]. Plasma total platinum was measured at multiple timepoints and patients were monitored weekly. Ten dogs were enrolled in single-patient-cohort treatment levels up to the maximum level of 140 mg/m[2]. There were no DLTs, and the maximally tolerated dose was not determined. The area under the curve0-7 days for 100-140 mg/m[2] ranged from 77,850 to 82,860 ng/mL &#215; hr; the area under the curve0-4 hr for 50-140 mg/m[2] was linear with dose (r[2] = 0.639, P = .0055). The data suggest a single infusion of oxaliplatin is well tolerated in cancer-bearing dogs up to 140 mg/m[2]. There was good correlation between exposure and dose, while achieving plasma levels similar to therapeutic levels documented in humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Oxaliplatin</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a subcapsular fluid-filled lesion of the left kidney, suspected cholecystitis, and a splenic infarct. The renal lesion was fully drained and cytology of the renal subcapsular and perirenal fluids revealed septic exudate. Bacterial culture of the urine, bile, and perirenal and subcapsular fluids were all positive for Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Antimicrobial therapy was instituted based on culture sensitivity. After 7 days the dog re-presented for vomiting and abdominal pain, and a focal intestinal injury was suspected based on abdominal ultrasound. Enterectomy of an ischemic jejunal loop, a partial splenectomy, and excision of the left renal subcapsular abscess were performed. The renal parenchyma was left intact. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of a renal subcapsular abscess, intestinal infarction, and focal pyogranulomatous splenitis. Cholecystitis was confirmed by bile cytology and culture. No major complications and no recurrences were encountered at 1 yr follow-up. This is the first report of a renal subcapsular abscess in the dog, with septic complications, and treated with a kidney-sparing surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abscess</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcal Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Staphylococcus</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of NTIHs in dogs. Medical records of 42 dogs with surgically treated NTIHs were reviewed. Forty-one dogs were included in the study, all dogs were small breeds weighing &lt;10 kg, and middle to older age (&gt;5 yr old; 33 cases), female sex (34 cases), and miniature dachshunds (26 cases) predominated. Left-sided occurrence was common (30 left, 9 right, 2 bilateral), and organ protrusion was seen in 22 cases (15 uteri, 9 small intestines, 1 colon). Fourteen of 15 uterine herniations (93%) were located left side. Ovariohysterectomy was performed with herniorrhaphy in 27/30 intact bitches, two of whom also underwent resection and anastomosis of a devitalized portion of the small intestine. Recurrence was seen in only one male dog. These results suggest that NTIHs are more likely to occur in small-breed female dogs, and that age may increase the risk of left-sided uterine protrusion; however, the long-term results after herniorrhaphy with ovariohysterectomy are excellent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia, Inguinal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Herniorrhaphy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33113556</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Evaluation of Contamination of Multiuse Suture Cassettes in an HQHVSN Environment.</Title>	<Abstract>Historically, it has been thought that suture cassettes become contaminated by bacteria through multiuse. However, High-Quality, High-Volume Spay/Neuter (HQHVSN) veterinarians have been using them for years without issue because of their significantly lower cost. The objective of this study was to determine if absorbable suture cassettes are contaminated through multiuse in an HQHVSN environment. A total of 101 suture samples from suture cassettes were collected from 25 HQHVSN clinics or shelters. The suture samples were placed in an enrichment broth tube and aerobic and anaerobic culture with microbe ID were performed. A total of 17/101 samples were positive for microbial growth, with 11/25 clinics having at least one positive sample. Based on these results, there is a significant risk to using suture cassettes that must be balanced against cost savings. Although HQHVSN veterinarians do not report an increase in infection using suture cassettes, based on the results of this study, there is likely contaminated suture being used during sterilization surgeries at these surgery sites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Data Collection</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Equipment Contamination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Orchiectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovariectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sutures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal imaging revealed a large, thin-walled, hypoechoic cystic lesion associated with the cranial pole of the left kidney and a second smaller cystic lesion on the caudal pole. The larger cystic lesion was repeatedly drained percutaneously, but the lesion returned to initial size and clinical signs returned within weeks. Percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy achieved only transient improvement in lesion size and abdominal discomfort. Laparoscopic deroofing and omentalization of the larger left renal cystic lesion was performed. The resected cystic wall was histopathologically consistent with a renal adenoma. Abdominal ultrasonography performed 1 mo postoperatively found no recurrence of the cystic renal adenoma. Repeated ultrasonography at 3 mo postoperatively detected a small cystic lesion at the cranial pole of the left kidney, which remained static in appearance at 11 and 18 mo postoperatively. During all follow-up visits, the dog was reported to be doing well with no recurrence of clinical signs. Renal cysts causing clinical signs and renal adenomas are rare in veterinary medicine; laparoscopic deroofing and omentalization provides a minimally invasive treatment approach.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adenoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Diseases, Cystic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laparoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Wound</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Pythiosis is reported in tropical and subtropical climates, affecting dogs and rarely cats. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice; however, cases present late in the disease and lesions are often nonresectable. Medical management is typically unsuccessful, with uncommon exceptions; however, mefenoxam, an agricultural fungicide, has in vitro efficacy against P insidiosum. We describe the use of mefenoxam, itraconazole, and terbinafine (MIT) in five dogs with gastrointestinal pythiosis and one dog with cutaneous pythiosis. Two of the gastrointestinal cases had disease extending to surgical margins and received MIT: resolution of clinical signs and seronegativity occurred after 189-193 days. Another case underwent surgical resection and MIT. The dog improved but subsequently developed a rectal mass, which responded to addition of prednisone and immunotherapy. Two cases were treated with MIT alone, and response varied. Efficacy of MIT in cutaneous pythiosis could not be determined. MIT may result in improved survival and seronegativity in dogs with incompletely resected gastrointestinal pythiosis. Mefenoxam is EPA registered, and extralabel use under the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act does not apply. Additional research is recommended before use.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>14-alpha Demethylase Inhibitors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Alanine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifungal Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Drug Therapy, Combination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gastrointestinal Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Health Services Accessibility</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Itraconazole</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pythiosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases, Parasitic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Terbinafine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Oral examination revealed a purple, spongy, pulsatile lesion on the rostral two-thirds of the tongue. Computed tomography angiography revealed a severely distended right linguofacial vein with numerous, tortuous branching vessels within the tongue, consistent with an arteriovenous (AV) malformation. A cervical surgical approach was performed, and the right lingual artery was isolated and catheterized. A direct arteriogram confirmed this was the main feeder artery to the lesion, and it was ligated. Although the bleeding episodes initially resolved, a moderate bleeding episode occurred 6 days postoperatively, and a partial glossectomy was performed. Histopathology was consistent with an AV malformation. The dog had a good recovery from surgery and remains free of clinical signs 13 mo later. Following extensive review of the veterinary literature, this is the only reported case of a lingual AV malformation in the dog. Partial glossectomy resulted in resolution of the clinical signs and was well tolerated.

In order to improve immunosuppression and decrease dosage and duration of glucocorticoid treatment, a second immunosuppressive drug is commonly used in most of the immune-mediated diseases. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and occurrence of relapse for the combination of prednisolone and azathioprine. All dogs received azathioprine 2 mg/kg q 24 hr for 1 mo and then 2 mg/kg every other day for 2 mo; prednisolone was started at an immunosuppressive dosage and tapered off gradually during a mean of 3 mo. Twenty-six dogs met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one dogs (81%) were in clinical remission with no relapse observed within the 2 yr follow-up period. Treatment was well tolerated in all dogs and side effects were most of the time mild and self-limiting. The relapse rate (19%) was lower than most published rates. A prednisolone and azathioprine combination appeared to be effective for primary treatment of dogs with SRMA and allows a quicker tapering in prednisolone dosage, a decrease in long-term side effects of steroids, a shorter duration of treatment, and a low relapse rate.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Arteritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Azathioprine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glucocorticoids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisolone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In three cases, small mass lesions of the spleen were identified on elective exploratory laparotomy. In one case, the patient was referred for emergency surgery for diaphragmatic hernia with entrapment of stomach and spleen. The discovery of avulsion of a significant portion of the splenic mesentery led to the decision to perform partial splenectomy in this case. All animals included in the study underwent partial splenectomy by one of two board-certified veterinary surgeons at a multispecialty hospital between 2014 and 2018. The same type of bipolar vessel-sealing device was used in each surgery, and three of four partial splenectomy cases recovered uneventfully. One patient went into cardiopulmonary arrest hours after surgery and died; however, this is not suspected to be due to the described partial splenectomy technique. The bipolar vessel-sealing device is suitable for use in resection of the splenic parenchyma in some canine and feline patients. This technique is designed to decrease surgical time, provide effective hemostasis, and preserve the important functions of the spleen that are lost when total splenectomy is undertaken.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Splenectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Equipment</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Both dogs had neurologic findings referable to spinal cord disease. Both dogs had a combination of lower motor neuron signs (reduced muscle mass, decreased withdrawal reflexes, low tail carriage) and long tract signs (conscious proprioceptive deficits, crossed extensor response, increased myotatic reflexes). Peripheral eosinophilia was present in the second case, but hematology and serum biochemistries were otherwise unremarkable. Plain radiographs and computed tomography scans &#177; contrast were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from both patients demonstrated eosinophilic pleocytosis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction testing demonstrated Angiostrongylus cantonensis deoxyribonucleic acid in CSF, confirming a diagnosis of neuroangiostrongyliasis. Treatment included glucocorticoid therapy, &#177; anthelmintic (fenbendazole). Both dogs made a complete recovery. These are the first confirmed cases of autochthonous neuroangiostrongyliasis in canine patients in the United States and the first dogs anywhere to be diagnosed definitively with A cantonensis infection based on real-time polymerase chain reaction testing of CSF. A clinician examining a patient with severe spinal hyperesthesia and a combination of upper and lower motor signs should consider A cantonensis as a differential, especially in endemic areas.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anthelmintics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glucocorticoids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hawaii</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Strongylida Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A retrospective evaluation was performed of 27 dogs that had gastric Physaloptera spp. infection confirmed endoscopically. In 23 of 27 dogs (85.2%), chronic vomiting was the chief complaint, and Physaloptera was an incidental finding in 3 dogs with esophageal or gastric foreign bodies. The worm burden was low (1-3 worms) in 21 dogs (77.8%), but 2 dogs were infected with large numbers (&gt;50 worms). Prior therapy with routine doses of anthelmintics was ineffective in eight dogs prior to endoscopy. A higher dose and longer duration of fenbendazole in combination with pyrantel pamoate is recommended for treatment of suspected or confirmed infections.

Medical records were reviewed retrospectively (2004-2018) for dogs with SND/HCS (n = 24) and SND/EN (n = 1). These data were compared with cases found by review of the literature of dogs with SND/HCS (n = 105) and SND/EN (n = 13). The most consistent findings with SND were dermatological lesions affecting paw pads or mucocutaneous junctions (143/143, 100%) and marked plasma hypoaminoacidemia (58/58, 100%). On ultrasound, a honeycomb liver was seen in 62/63 (98%) dogs with SND/HCS but none with SND/EN. Six out of 23 (26%) dogs in the retrospective study with SND/HCS had marked keratinocyte apoptosis, a finding that was associated with diabetes mellitus. This study suggests that in dogs with characteristic skin lesions, an amino acid profile permits a noninvasive diagnosis of SND. An abdominal ultrasound can then assist in the differentiation of SND/HCS and SND/EN.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

MRI of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated an intradural-extramedullary mass lesion at the level of T12 and extradural spinal cord compression at L1-L2. A hemilaminectomy was performed to achieve gross total resection of the mass lesion and removal of extruded disc material. A diagnosis of spinal choroid plexus tumor (CPT) and intervertebral disc extrusion was made. At 4 mo postoperatively, MRI demonstrated a mass lesion at the right lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle. Spinal drop metastasis from a primary intracranial CPT was suspected. The dog was ambulating independently and neurologically normal at that time. At 17 mo postoperatively, a third MRI was performed owing to decreased postural reactions in both hind limbs and vision loss in the right eye, and it demonstrated an increase in size of the intracranial mass lesion. These two additional MRI studies of the entire central nervous system showed no other metastatic lesions nor any evidence of local recurrence. At 25 mo postoperatively, the dog died at home. This is the first case report of surgical intervention and antemortem histopathological diagnosis of a spinal CPT in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Choroid Plexus Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Glioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Clinical information from five dogs with malformed dens and dorsal spinal cord compression at the AA junction was collected. All dogs had neck pain, associated with tetraparesis in three cases. Radiological examination revealed hypoplastic dens in two dogs and a defect in its ossification in the other three. Stress views were able to demonstrate obvious AA instability only in two cases, but it was suspected in the other owing to response to surgical fixation of the joint and the presence of a dorsal compressive band, which was considered an enlarged dorsal AA ligament. Surgical and histopathological examination of compressive tissue confirmed hypertrophy of the ligament. Long-term prognosis in the four operated cases, either by dorsal decompression and ventral fixation or by ventral fixation alone, was excellent. A malformed dens can cause subclinical instability, unnoted in dynamic studies. As instability may lead to hypertrophy of joint ligaments, soft tissue changes (specifically dorsal AA ligament hypertrophy) points out this instability and the need for joint fixation if surgical management is required.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atlanto-Axial Joint</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypertrophy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Joint Instability</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ligaments, Articular</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Odontoid Process</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Significant clinicopathologic abnormalities included severe liver enzyme elevations and hypercholesterolemia. Abdominal imaging identified vascular compromise of the left lateral liver lobe and a gallbladder mucocele. Following liver lobectomy and cholecystectomy, the dog's clinical signs resolved, and liver enzymes substantially improved. Diffuse hepatocellular infarction and necrosis secondary to multifocal atherosclerosis was present on histopathology of the liver. Hypothyroidism was subsequently diagnosed. Restoration of euthyroidism with oral levothyroxine therapy resolved the remaining liver enzyme elevations and hypercholesterolemia. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of hypothyroidism resulting in a clinically apparent and resolvable acute hepatopathy due to atherosclerosis. Clinicians should include atherosclerosis as a differential diagnosis for dogs with an acute hepatopathy and investigate dogs for hypothyroidism if atherosclerosis is diagnosed on liver biopsy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Atherosclerosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatic Infarction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypothyroidism</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Necrosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thyroxine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computed tomography imaging revealed a large (2.4 &#215; 2.7 cm), well-defined, pedunculated osseous mass arising from the right parietal bone. Cytology was inconclusive, and surgical biopsy was consistent with an osteoma. Further enlargement of the mass occurred over the next 3 mo, at which time surgical intervention was pursued. The patient recovered well, despite the persistence of a bony defect at the former mass site, and no mass regrowth occurred in the 14 mo following the surgical resection. This is one of only two reports in the literature to document the surgical removal of an osteoma in a ferret, and this is the sole case in which a custom apparatus was fabricated for head stabilization, a multiaxis adjustable surgical table was used to improve access to the surgical site, and an ultrasonic scalpel was used for the mass resection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bone Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ferrets</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurosurgical Procedures</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Osteoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parietal Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography, Interventional</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Thoracic radiographs revealed multifocal pulmonary hyperinflation and hyperlucency suspected in the left caudal and accessory lung lobes. A thoracic computed tomography scan identified severe diffuse enlargement of the caudal subsegment of the left cranial lung lobe and the dorsal process of the accessory lung lobe, with parenchymal hypoattenuation, rounded margins, and thin pulmonary vessels. Based on clinical signs and imaging findings, he was diagnosed with suspect congenital lobar emphysema in multiple lung lobes. A median sternotomy was performed, which revealed a hyperinflated, emphysematous left cranial lung lobe (caudal subsegment) and accessory lung lobe for which two lung lobectomies were performed. The remaining lung lobes were small and atelectatic. Histopathology revealed bronchial cartilage hypoplasia and aplasia and findings consistent with congenital lobar emphysema. The puppy recovered well from surgical treatment of congenital lobar emphysema, requiring multiple lung lobectomies, with subsequent computed tomography-evidenced re-expansion of the remaining lung lobes 3 mo after surgery. The patient is still alive 1 yr after surgery with a normal activity level and no evidence of respiratory compromise.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals, Newborn</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Emphysema</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The cat was hypothermic and bradycardic and had pale pink mucous membranes, poor pulses, and a distended abdomen. Point-of-care ultrasound identified significant abdominal effusion, which was diagnosed to be a hemoabdomen. Bloodwork revealed hyperlactatemia, regenerative anemia, neutrophilia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased alanine aminotransferase. The cat received an allotransfusion and a subsequent canine xenotransfusion and received further supportive therapy. After stabilization, abdominal ultrasonography diagnosed a gallbladder and liver lobe torsion with hemoabdomen. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the torsion of the right medial and quadrate hepatic lobes together with the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and lobectomy of the affected lobes were performed using a surgical stapler. The cat was discharged after 4 days. Histopathology confirmed hemorrhagic infarction of the liver lobes and gallbladder, consistent with the described torsion, and the hepatic pseudocyst. It also demonstrated a mucocele in the gallbladder. One month postoperatively, the cat had totally recovered. Hepatic lobe torsion without neoplasia is a rare disease in cats, with variable clinical signs. Gallbladder torsion is a hitherto unreported condition in cats. This is the first report of gallbladder and liver lobe torsion with secondary hemoabdomen in a cat, successfully treated by one-stage surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gallbladder</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Torsion Abnormality</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>33450023</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type><Type>Review</Type>	<Title>Pituitary Surgery: Changing the Paradigm in Veterinary Medicine in the United States.</Title>	<Abstract>Medical management is currently the most common treatment for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and hypersomatotropism/acromegaly in veterinary medicine. Medical management does not provide a cure for either disease process, and rarely is pituitary imaging a part of initial diagnostics. Early pituitary imaging in animals with clinically functional pituitary tumors provides a baseline assessment, allows monitoring of tumor changes, and permits radiation and surgical planning. Surgery is the only treatment for pituitary tumors that has curative intent and allows for a definitive diagnosis. Surgical removal of pituitary tumors via transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is an effective treatment for clinical pituitary tumors in patients exhibiting endocrine abnormalities associated with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and hypersomatotropism. Surgery, however, is rarely pursued until patients have failed medical management, and often not until they are showing neurologic signs, making surgical success challenging. It is well documented that dogs surgically treated when the pituitary mass is small have a lower mortality, a lower recurrence rate, and a longer survival than those with larger pituitary masses. Providing owners with the option of early pituitary imaging in addition to medical, surgical, and radiation treatment options should be the standard of care for animals diagnosed with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism or hypersomatotropism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypophysectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pituitary Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Signal changes within the musculature were consistent with myositis, edema, and abscessation. Inflammation and edema surrounded the foreign body, and a dorsal cervical myelopathy extended caudally to the level of C6. Computed tomography attenuation values of the foreign body were most consistent with plant material.

The cat was hospitalized and received standard supportive therapy for urinary tract obstruction with urinary catheterization, with the addition of intravesical saline flushes in an attempt to promote bladder clot lysis. The cat was subsequently discharged after voluntary urination was observed. The cat was represented 28 hr after discharge because of clinical signs consistent with urinary tract obstruction. The cat was hospitalized and intravesical tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusions (0.5 mg of tPA in 10 mL of saline with 2 hr dwell time q 8 hr) were administered to break down the bladder clot (2.78 &#215; 4.46 cm). Thirty-two hours after starting tPA, the clot was no longer visible on ultrasound. The cat was discharged with no recurrent symptoms in the subsequent 11 mo. This is the first report of tPA being used for dissolution of bladder clot in a cat. There were no observed complications, suggesting that intravesical instillation of tPA may be a safe and efficacious therapy in cats, similar to the previously reported successes in dogs and humans.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Abdominal Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Thrombosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tissue Plasminogen Activator</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Bladder Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Catheterization</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Case reports of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate glue ingestion in dogs document gastrointestinal foreign body formation and mechanical obstruction. Medical record queries from four veterinary hospitals identified 22 dogs with Gorilla Glue ingestion. Records were evaluated retrospectively to characterize clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment, and patient outcome. Vomiting was the most common clinical sign (n = 11), with a median time from ingestion to presentation of 42 hr. Abnormal abdominal palpation (e.g., pain) was the most reported examination finding (n = 13). Radiographs were performed in 18/22 dogs, with Gorilla Glue expansion described as granular or mottled soft tissue with gas in the stomach. In 73% (11/15) of dogs requiring surgery, history, clinical findings, and survey abdominal radiographs sufficed to proceed with celiotomy. Surgical removal of the Gorilla Glue foreign body was performed via gastrotomy (n = 14) or gastrotomy and duodenotomy (n = 1). Endoscopic removal was performed in one dog. One dog with suspected mechanical obstruction was euthanized owing to financial constraints. Remaining cases were managed conservatively (n = 5). Short-term prognosis following appropriate fluid therapy and surgical or endoscopic removal was very good.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isocyanates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Stomach</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Computed tomography described an irregular, cystic structure closely associated with the duodenum, and focal ultrasonography confirmed the mass shared outer layers with the intestinal wall. Coeliotomy revealed the mass was originating from, and firmly adhered to, the antimesenteric border of the duodenum but was not communicating with the intestinal lumen. En bloc mass resection with omentalization was performed without small intestinal resection. Histopathology confirmed an enteric duplication cyst. The cat made a full recovery and remained asymptomatic postoperatively with no evidence of recurrence. A review of the literature confirms the duodenum to be the most common location of enteric duplication cysts in felines and that subtotal excision is curative in most cases. This differential should be considered in cases of cystic gastrointestinal structures in juvenile and adult felines, with or without associated clinical signs. In cases of luminal involvement or malignant transformation, intestinal resection and anastomosis is more appropriate.

Histopathology and cytology records were searched at a veterinary teaching hospital and a veterinary diagnostic laboratory to identify dogs with rhinosporidiosis. Medical records were reviewed for clinical, imaging, endoscopic, and surgical findings. Outcome was determined via evaluation of records and, where possible, telephone conversation with the primary care veterinarian and/or owner. Young to middle-aged large-breed dogs with an approximately equal sex distribution were represented. Unilateral signs predominated. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in 9 cases, and cytology was diagnostic in only 1 of 3 cases. Histopathology was superior to cytology. Masses were soft tissue and contrast enhancing with no evidence of bony lysis on computed tomography (2 dogs). Direct or rhinoscopic (2 dogs) visualization revealed white to yellow pinpoint foci. Surgical resection (4 dogs) can result in long-term disease-free periods (up to 2659 days), although repeat surgery can be required. Dapsone was well tolerated in 1 dog, and relapse was not noted despite incomplete surgical resection (follow-up 749 days).

Computed tomography of the skull revealed a large mineral attenuating mass associated with the left skull base, without intracranial involvement. A modified ventral paramedian hypophysectomy approach along the medial aspect of the left ramus was used to approach the base of the skull. Ninety percent of the mass was debulked via high-speed pneumatic burr. Histopathology was consistent with hyperostosis originating from a primary extracranial meningioma (ECM), with the tissue staining positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin. The patient was symptom free for 9 mo before clinical signs returned because of tumor recurrence and was euthanized 11 mo postoperation because of diminished quality of life. ECM is uncommonly reported in the dog, and to the authors' knowledge has not previously been reported with hyperostosis or located along the skull base at the level of the tympanic bulla. Additionally, although hyperostosis predominantly occurs as diffuse bone thickening adjacent to a meningioma, proliferative focal hyperostosis is uncommon. Given the findings in this patient, ECM should be considered as a differential diagnosis for osseous skull base masses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperostosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningeal Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pedigree</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skull</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We evaluated the long-term treatment outcomes of seven dogs with malignant ovarian tumors with malignant abdominal effusion. Ovariohysterectomies (OVHs) were performed on all dogs; four had ovarian adenocarcinoma (AC) with gross dissemination in the peritoneum (two with pleural effusion), and three had a granulosa cell tumor (GCT) with no gross dissemination in the peritoneal cavity, although one showed pleural effusion. Effusion resolved after the OVH in all dogs. Six dogs (three ACs, three GCTs) received postoperative IV carboplatin therapy. Two dogs with GCT had no postoperative recurrence or metastasis, and one dog with GCT had recurrence 1811 days postoperatively. All dogs with AC developed recurrent effusion 171-584 days postoperatively, which resolved after intracavitary administration of cisplatin or carboplatin, with a subsequent disease-free interval of 155-368 days. Overall survival was longer for dogs with GCTs (822-1840 days) than for those with ACs (617-841 days). These results suggest that dogs with ovarian tumors with malignant effusion can survive relatively long after platinum-based chemotherapy in addition to OVH, with a more favorable prognosis for GCT than AC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Combined Modality Therapy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Japan</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasm Recurrence, Local</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ovarian Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pleural Effusion, Malignant</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Survival Analysis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Only sporadic reports of CRE in companion animals have been described. Our objective was to identify risk factors associated with the acquisition of a blaNDM-5 CR-Escherichia coli strain as part of an outbreak investigation at a tertiary veterinary hospital in the United States. A matched case-control study was conducted among companion animals admitted during July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. The 15 identified blaNDM-5 CR-E coli cases were matched 1:2 with controls (culture negative for blaNDM-5 CR-E coli) based on species and number of days of hospitalization before bacterial culture sample collection. The association between exposure to various procedures and hospital services and the acquisition of blaNDM-5 CR-E. coli was assessed through conditional logistic regression. Case patients had significantly higher odds of exposure to the anesthesia service (odds ratio [OR] = 12.8, P = .017), the surgical service (OR = 4.0, P = .046), and to endotracheal intubation (OR = 10.0, P = .03). Veterinary hospitals should be aware of the potential for transmission of CRE via anesthetic and surgical procedures, especially those that require the placement of endotracheal tubes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Case-Control Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease Outbreaks</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Escherichia coli Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hospitals, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Philadelphia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>beta-Lactamases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal radiographs revealed EC and a pneumoperitoneum. The urinary bladder was found to be intact based on ultrasound and a pre- and postiohexol contrast computed tomography study with retrograde contrast cystogram. Urine culture confirmed the presence of a recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. The patient was managed medically, primarily as an outpatient, and had complete resolution of all problems. This case represents an extremely rare form of EC with pneumoperitoneum, without evidence of concurrent urinary bladder rupture.

<Rec><Common><PMID>34097028</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type><Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Renal Osteodystrophy due to Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in a Cat.</Title>	<Abstract>A 6 yr old neutered male mixed-breed cat presented for renal transplantation (RTx) for chronic kidney disease. Severe periodontal disease was identified, and before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, a comprehensive oral health assessment and treatment procedure was performed to reduce the burden of existing oral infection. Dental radiography revealed diffuse, severe bone demineralization across the mandible and maxilla, with thinning of the cortices. Nasal turbinates were easily visualized owing to the decreased opacity of maxillary bone. Generalized bone resorption left teeth to appear minimally attached. A Vitamin D panel revealed a severely elevated parathyroid hormone level. Full mouth extractions were performed. Seven days following this procedure, RTx was performed. Serum creatinine concentration was within normal limits by 48 hr after surgery and remained normal until discharge 12 days after RTx. At 3.5 mo after RTx, the cat was mildly azotemic, and the parathyroid hormone level was elevated but significantly decreased from the original measurement. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common abnormality in cats with chronic kidney disease. However, clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism are rare in this species. This is a novel presentation of a cat demonstrating bone loss in the oral cavity as a result of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Kidney Transplantation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Parathyroid Hormone</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Patients were divided into malignant and benign groups according to the final diagnosis. Medical records and MRI studies were retrospectively reviewed, and specific imaging features were compared. The malignant group comprised 15 dogs, with 5 dogs included in the benign group. MRI features of the different histopathologic/cytologic types of masses are described. Involvement of the vertebral body, a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted, short tau inversion recovery, T1-weighted, and T1-weighted gradient echo sequences and evidence of cortical destruction were signifi-cantly associated with malignancy (P &lt; .05). Hypointensity on T1-weighted gradient echo sequence was significantly associated with benign masses (P &lt; .05). The presence of bone sclerosis was significantly associated with osteosarcomas compared with other malignant masses (P &lt; .05). Fractures (5 cases) were only seen in the group of malignant masses. This pilot study identifies some MRI features that may help differentiate between malignant and benign solitary vertebral masses. Greater case numbers are needed in future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pilot Projects</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>34228790</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>2021 AAHA Nutrition and Weight Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats.</Title>	<Abstract>The guidelines discuss the components of a systematic approach to nutritional management of dogs and cats. A nutritional assessment, including a body condition score and muscle condition score, is a screening evaluation that should ideally be performed at every examination. Individualized nutritional recommendations, based on the nutritional assessment, should be designed to achieve and maintain an appropriate body weight and meet nutritional requirements. Communicating nutritional recommendations to clients is a challenging aspect of nutritional management because pet owners may interpret the practice team's guidance as advocacy for a particular pet food brand or a judgment of the client's ability to properly care for the pet or of the owner's own nutritional status. The guidelines discuss approaches for effective, nonjudgmental communication of dietary recommendations to clients and strategies to increase acceptance of and adherence to veterinary nutrition recommendations. Other pet nutrition topics of current interest include recommendations for particular pet life stages, breeds, and disease conditions; risk factors for nutritional deficiencies and obesity; and considerations for home-prepared diets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutrition Assessment</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nutritional Status</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although case reports in human medicine have identified fatalities due to misplacement of nasogastric (NG) tubes into the tracheobronchial tree and subsequent pneumothorax, there are no case reports, to our knowledge, of fatalities in veterinary patients. This case report describes two fatalities caused by misplaced NG tubes in intubated patients (one intraoperative, one postoperative). This report highlights risk factors for feeding tube complications and methods to prevent future fatalities such as two-view radiography, two-step insertion, capnography, laryngoscopic-assisted placement, and palpation of the NG tube in the stomach. The recent fatalities discussed within this case series demonstrate that deaths as a result of NG tubes misplaced into the tracheobronchial tree occur in veterinary patients, and measures should be taken to prevent this complication.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enteral Nutrition</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intubation, Gastrointestinal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pneumothorax</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Although labeled for intramuscular use, it is commonly given by owners via a subcutaneous (SC) route. There is little information on adverse events related to SC administration or what other therapies are used concurrently with PSGAG. We hypothesized that SC PSGAG is perceived by owners as having minimal adverse events and that it would most often be given with other therapies. Owners (n = 378) were surveyed about their perceptions regarding SC PSGAG prescribed to dogs at one veterinary rehabilitation clinic. Complete surveys were provided for 69 dogs (two owners had multiple dogs). Overall, 13/69 (18.8%) dogs had an adverse event reported during the use of PSGAG. Most events were considered minor (stomach upset, loose stool, pain at injection site, fear) and did not lead to discontinuation of PSGAG. One dog experienced a moderate adverse event (persistent gastrointestinal symptoms) and one a severe adverse event (thrombocytopenia, bruising), which resolved after discontinuing PSGAG. PSGAG is most commonly administered along with other medications and rehabilitation therapies. The present study demonstrates that SC administration of PSGAG is well tolerated in most of the dogs, with primarily mild, self-resolving adverse events.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To determine the epidemiology of minoxidil exposures and toxicoses in dogs and cats, 211 dog and cat cases with topical minoxidil exposure were identified from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Animal Poison Control Center database. In 87 cases with clinical signs of toxicosis (62 cats, 25 dogs), case narratives were reviewed and coded for exposure-related circumstances. Unintentional delivery, especially while pet owners applied minoxidil for his/her own hair loss (e.g., pet licked owner's skin or pillowcase, pet was splashed during a medication spill), was the most common cat exposure circumstance. Exploratory behavior (e.g., searching through trash) was the most common dog exposure circumstance. Clinical signs occurred in dogs and cats even with low exposure amounts, such as drops or licks. In patients that developed clinical signs, most developed moderate or major illness (56.0% dogs, 59.7% cats). Death occurred in 8/62 (12.9%) cats that developed clinical signs after the pet owner's minoxidil use. Pet owners should be educated on the risk of dog and cat toxicosis from accidental minoxidil exposure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Minoxidil</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ideally filled, overfilled, and underfilled K3 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes with various volumes of healthy dog blood on centrifuged PCV. Six milliliters of blood was obtained from 94 blood donors each. Initial distribution was injected into two nonheparinized microhematocrit tubes. The remainder was instilled into 1.3 mL K3 EDTA spray-dried tubes as 1.5 mL, 1.3 mL, 0.75 mL, 0.5 mL, and 0.25 mL aliquots. Normality was determined using the D'agostino-Pearson method and by visual examination of histograms. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc testing using Tukey's test. There is a statistically significant decrease in the PCV between all groups with progressive underfilling of tubes (P &lt; .0001). The closest difference is between 1.5 and 1.3 mL (P = .0138). Our study suggested that underfilling K3 EDTA tubes significantly and negatively influences the PCV in healthy dogs. Using underfilled K3 EDTA tubes result in a lower PCV compared with directly filled microhematocrit tubes without anticoagulant.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anticoagulants</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cell Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Edetic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hematocrit</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Two separate fine needle aspiration cytology samples showed marked pyogranulomatous inflammation with no cytologically apparent infectious etiology or neoplasia. Computed tomography imaging revealed a well-marginated, heterogeneous, contrast-enhancing soft-tissue mass extending into the adjacent fat, suggestive of neoplasia. A 14G needle biopsy showed similar chronic inflammatory changes without evidence of neoplasia or infectious etiology. Excisional biopsy of the mass was performed, and ex vivo sectioning revealed Taenia crassiceps cysticerci. Histopathology confirmed severe chronic pyogranulomatous cellulitis and myositis with intralesional cysticerci. Anthelmintic treatment was administered postoperatively, and no evidence of local recurrence has been noted as of 6 mo after the operation.

Medical records of 65 client-owned dogs were retrospectively reviewed, and data were obtained regarding treatment history, referral timeframe, recurrence rate, clinical signs, and resolution of signs. The median number of otitis recurrences while under the care of the pcDVM was 4 (range 1-40) versus collaborative BCVD care of 2 (P &lt; .01). There was a longer median time to otitis recurrence with collaborative care (171 days) compared with dogs managed by the pcDVM before referral (21 days; P &gt; .01). Proliferative changes in the ear canals improved in 41/45 (91%) of cases under BCVD care compared with 6/45 (13%) under care by the pcDVM (P &lt; .01). Dogs with chronic otitis had better long-term outcomes when collaboration with a BCVD was pursued within 6 mo of treatment.

Physical examination revealed urine leakage and abnormal external genitalia. A computed tomography scan identified a large fluid-filled cavity extending from the caudoventral abdomen displacing the colon and urinary bladder. No retained testicles were identified. A retrograde urethrogram study found a linear communication, cranial to the pubic brim between the urethra to the fluid-filled cavity (fistula). Exploratory celiotomy was performed, and an entire female reproductive tract with a blind-ending vagina and a urethrovaginal fistula was found. En bloc gonad hysterectomy was performed, the fistula was transected, and a careful urethral reconstruction was performed. The urinary incontinence resolved immediately after surgery, and no complications were reported. Mild urinary incontinence recurred 4 days following patient discharge, and a urine bacterial culture was positive for Klebsiella spp. An antibiotic course was prescribed, and the incontinence fully resolved. Congenital urogenital abnormalities should always be considered in young animals presenting with urinary incontinence. Here, a young female pseudohermaphrodite dog with a naturally occurring congenital urethrovaginal fistula is described. Exploratory surgery was required for definitive diagnosis and surgical intervention yielded a good medium-term outcome with resolution of clinical signs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethra</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Incontinence</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urogenital Abnormalities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vagina</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted with 10 client-owned cats. Vital parameters, physical exam, blood pressure, echocardiography, and sedation scoring were performed at each visit within 2 hr of receiving either a placebo or gabapentin capsule. Vital parameters, blood pressure recordings, and echocardiographic measurements were compared between baseline, gabapentin, and placebo; interobserver agreement for sedation scoring and correlation between variables were also evaluated. Seven of 10 cats exhibited mild sedation within 120 min after receiving gabapentin, and no adverse events occurred. Significant differences were detected with two-dimensional fractional shortening (P = .022), left ventricular internal diameter in systole using M-mode (P = .014), and left atrial volume (P &lt; .0001). Interobserver agreement for sedation scoring was near-perfect (&#954; = 0.84). No significant correlation was found for gabapentin dosage and sedation score. Single-dose oral gabapentin is well tolerated in healthy cats and produces a modest decrease in several echocardiographic parameters of systolic function; however, all affected variables remained within established reference ranges. These results suggest gabapentin may be an appropriate sedative to administer before echocardiography in cats necessitating mild sedation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Echocardiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gabapentin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hemodynamics</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hypnotics and Sedatives</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This category of canine patients includes a broad assortment of animals, some with well-defined functions and others that provide a more generalized support role. The guidelines discuss recommendations for dogs trained for protection, odor/scent detection, service functions for people with diagnosed disabilities or physical limitations, emotional support, and therapeutic intervention. Although the term is often used to describe dogs providing animal-assisted activities, true therapy dogs provide goal-directed therapy, often under the supervision of a healthcare professional such as an occupational therapist or psychologist. Many working dogs undergo extensive training and have rigorous physical demands placed upon them. These factors make working, assistance, and therapy dogs inherently valuable and impose a need for a high level of primary veterinary care as described in the guidelines. Because working dogs have a particularly close relationship with their handlers, a trust relationship between the practice team and the working-dog client is imperative.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Therapy Animals</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Because of the patient's temperament and extent of the mass, tracheobronchoscopy, bronchial stenting, and biopsy were elected, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Stent placement across the malignantly obstructed bronchus permitted drainage and recruitment of the infected lung lobe. Uncomplicated radiation therapy, stent extension, and debulking due to tissue ingrowth were subsequently performed.

<Rec><Common><PMID>35195710</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Determination of Mammalian Deoxyribonucleic Acid in Commercial Canine Treats and Supplements.</Title>	<Abstract>Feeding an elimination diet exclusively is currently the only accurate diagnostic test for an adverse food reaction in dogs and cats. However, owner compliance has been identified as a challenge, and the inability to limit exposure to other items (including treats and supplements) is a remarkable reason for failure. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the presence of declared and undeclared mammalian deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in commercially available canine treats and supplements using polymerase chain reaction methodology. Eight treat products and 20 supplement products were analyzed for the DNA of 10 mammalian species (bison, cat, cow, dog, goat, horse, mouse, rat, pig, and sheep). The results showed that 88% (7/8) of treats and 40% (8/20) of supplements were found to contain at least one source of undeclared mammalian DNA. Undeclared pig and cow DNA were the most frequently identified, and there were only two instances of negative results for declared species. Because of the frequent finding of undeclared mammalian DNA in the assessed products, avoiding using treats and supplements during elimination trials is recommended.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animal Feed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cattle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>DNA</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dietary Supplements</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Goats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Horses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mice</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sheep</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Swine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

It can cause sterile hemorrhagic cystitis (SHC), and furosemide is used to decrease the incidence of SHC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of SHC in dogs treated with a bolus maximum tolerated dose of oral cyclophosphamide and oral furosemide at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Medical records were reviewed to determine the incidence of SHC, dose and number of oral cyclophosphamide treatments, and the dose of furosemide. Other side effects from cyclophosphamide were also recorded. Eighty-one client-owned dogs that received a single oral maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide concurrent with oral furosemide as part of a chemotherapy protocol for lymphoma were included in the study. A total of 252 doses of cyclophosphamide were administered to 81 dogs. The median dose of cyclophosphamide was 239.3 mg/m2. The median dose of furosemide was 1.08 mg/kg. SHC was suspected in 2 dogs (2.46%). Concurrent use of furosemide at a dose of 1 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide yields a similar incidence of SHC than using a higher dose of furosemide as previously reported.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Furosemide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Incidence</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Recognizing pain is fundamental to successful treatment, and diagnostic guides and algorithms are included for assessment of both acute and chronic pain. Particularly for chronic pain, capturing owner evaluation is important, and pain-assessment instruments for pet owners are described. Expert consensus emphasizes proactive, preemptive pain management rather than a reactive, "damage control" approach. The guidelines discuss treatment options centered on preemptive, multimodal analgesic therapies. There is an extensive variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for the management of acute and chronic pain in cats and dogs. The guidelines include a tiered decision tree that prioritizes the use of the most efficacious therapeutic modalities for the treatment of acute and chronic pain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Management</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain Measurement</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

OSA independent from BOAS has been rarely reported. Treatment of OSA with ondansetron has only been reported in one dog and has not been reported in a breed commonly affected by BOAS. Here, we report the case of a pug with episodes of OSA despite appropriate treatment of BOAS. Administration of ondansetron led to a rapid and near-complete resolution of the clinical signs, with a follow-up of 3 mo. OSA independent of BOAS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs that present for sleep-disordered breathing without exercise intolerance after appropriate treatment for BOAS. Use of certain serotonin antagonists may be useful as a treatment option for these cases.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Airway Obstruction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Craniosynostoses</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ondansetron</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sleep Apnea, Obstructive</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Syndrome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twelve client-owned cats were included in the study. This retrospective study spanned 13 yr and involved 22 eyes. The median age at the time of surgery was 15 mo (range: 4.5-168 mo of age). Recorded complications were 3 eyes developed postoperative ocular hypertension, 1 eye developed glaucoma, 7 eyes developed feline herpes virus-1 signs, and 7 eyes developed postoperative uveitis &gt;2 wk after surgery. No eyes had developed intraocular sarcomas at the time of their last exam. All eyes remained visual at last follow-up (range: 0.5-121 mo). Success was defined as a comfortable and visual eye without intraocular neoplasia, glaucoma, a partial or complete retinal detachment, or uveitis that occurred &gt;2 wk after surgery or persisted longer than 2 wk.

Thoracic radiography revealed hyperinflation of the left cranial lung lobe and a mass with soft-tissue/gas opacity in the caudal mediastinum, leading to the suspicion of congenital lung lobe emphysema and hiatal hernia. Decreased bone radiopacity and suspected pathological fractures were also present. Complete clinicopathological analyses showed significant ionized hypocalcemia and suspicion of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to an inadequate diet. Lung lobectomy and reduction of the hiatal hernia following a median sternotomy and a cranial laparotomy were performed. IV and oral supplementation of calcium led to a full recovery and improvement in the kitten's walking. A histopathological analysis revealed pulmonary emphysema associated with hypoplastic and irregular bronchial cartilage. Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare disease in both humans and animals. This is the first veterinary report describing a kitten affected by congenital lobar emphysema combined with a hiatal hernia and additionally complicated by secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism with a good long-term outcome.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hernia, Hiatal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lung</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pulmonary Emphysema</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

There are no specific antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies recognized for treatment of CDV infections, and the neurological form typically carries with it a high mortality rate. The intrathecal injection of a modified live Newcastle disease virus vaccine (NDV-MLV) has been proposed for the treatment of the neurological forms of CDV infections. Thirteen dogs confirmed to have canine distemper infections by polymerase chain reaction testing and with neurological signs consistent with CDV infection were treated with an intrathecal injection of NDV-MLV and were scheduled for re-evaluation 3-4 mo later. Six dogs survived to follow-up and four dogs survived long term (&gt;3 yr). Cerebrospinal fluid cytokines were measured and reported. Changes in cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and long-term survival could not be attributed to the intrathecal injection of NDV-MLV, and this therapy cannot be recommended for treatment of dogs with neurological forms of CDV infection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cytokines</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Distemper Virus, Canine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Encephalitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Injections, Spinal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Newcastle disease virus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccines, Attenuated</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Viral Vaccines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Associations of aCTc with patient variables were explored, and all results were compared with published aCTc of healthy cats. No incidental adrenal masses were identified in the PAD group (n = 92), and only few aCTc differed compared to the NAD group (n = 30).

A 5 yr old, male, neutered Labrador retriever presented for acute onset anorexia, lethargy, and vomiting. Cholecystitis was diagnosed based on the ultrasonographic findings and bactibilia, and, consequently, medical treatment was established. Despite improvement of the patient, a focal ultrasound of the hepatobiliary tract was performed 72 hr after admission for reassessment, revealing gallbladder wall thickening and abdominal effusion. Intracellular bacteria were present in nondegenerated neutrophils, and the effusion was categorized as septic exudate, compatible with septic peritonitis. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed an anicteric gallbladder rupture potentially secondary to cholecystitis and/or previous cholecystocentesis. The patient was not icteric the day of the surgery, serum bilirubin was within normal limits, abdominal fluid bilirubin concentration was below that of serum, and no bile pigment was detected; however, bile acids were significantly higher in the abdominal effusion compared with the serum concentration. This case describes an anicteric gallbladder rupture in a dog with concomitant cholecystitis and raises the question about the sensitivity of bile acid evaluation as a tool for diagnosis of gallbladder rupture and bile peritonitis in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bile Acids and Salts</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bilirubin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cholecystitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Exudates and Transudates</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Gallbladder Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Rupture</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An episioplasty can be recommended for correction of this abnormality when medical management of recurrent urinary tract infection fails. The objective of this study was to investigate the type and incidence of urogenital abnormalities visualized by cystoscopy in dogs presenting for episioplasty. Medical records of 29 dogs that presented for an episioplasty and had a concurrent or prior cystoscopy were reviewed. Eleven of the 29 dogs had urogenital abnormalities diagnosed on cystoscopic evaluation, and 1 dog was diagnosed with a urogenital abnormality during vaginal examination while under general anesthesia. Ten of the dogs with urogenital abnormalities had a corrective procedure performed, 8 of which were cystoscopically assisted. Cystoscopy provides the ability to directly visualize the urinary tract and obtain samples for biopsy and culture and facilitates correction of some anatomic abnormalities that may predispose the patient to developing recurrent urinary tract infections. Cystoscopy should be considered as a routine part of a thorough evaluation of the urinary tract in cases presenting for episioplasty.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Anesthesia, General</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cystoscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neurosurgical Procedures</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

One hundred forty-one pruritic dogs &gt;1 yr of age with a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and a &gt;3 mo history of pruritus were recruited. Dog owners completed a behavioral survey (canine behavioral assessment and research questionnaire) and a pruritus scale (pruritus visual analog scale). Pruritic, atopic dogs showed significant increases in fear- and anxiety-related behaviors as well as aggression compared with a large control group of healthy dogs. Stranger-directed aggression, owner-directed aggression, familiar-dog aggression, dog-directed fear, nonsocial fear, touch sensitivity, excitability, and attention-seeking behaviors were all increased in the study group. Trainability was decreased in the study group. Chronically pruritic dogs experience fear and anxiety and are more likely to display aggression. This is an important welfare issue for these animals. Early recognition of the behavioral derangements that can be associated with chronic pruritic skin disease could allow early intervention with a multidisciplinary approach for these patients, thus improving patient and owner quality of life and long-term treatment outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Aggression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anxiety</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Behavior, Animal</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis, Atopic</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fear</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pruritus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Initial diagnostics indicated pancreatitis with secondary hepatic lipidosis. Supportive care, including the placement of an esophageal feeding tube, was initiated. The feeding tube was removed traumatically by the cat and thus replaced. The cat acutely deteriorated while hospitalized, developing marked hypersalivation and an obtunded mentation. Radiographs were taken to confirm placement of the feeding tube in case tube dislodgement was contributing to the hypersalivation; results confirmed appropriate positioning and gastric pneumatosis. Despite intensified medical management, the patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest 7 days after hospital admission. Post-mortem examination confirmed necrotizing gastritis with emphysema alongside segmental mucosal necrosis in the jejunum, focal pancreatic necrosis, and diffuse hepatic lipidosis. Gas in the gastric wall is a rare finding in veterinary medicine and can arise due to gastric pneumatosis or emphysematous gastritis; there are scant reports of either in feline medicine.

The objective of this case series was to describe the postoperative outcomes of localized intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma in dogs. The electronic medical records of 16 dogs with bile duct carcinoma were reviewed, and 6 dogs were included in the study. All cases were diagnosed as bile duct carcinoma using postoperative pathology, and five of them had already been diagnosed using preoperative core biopsy. The tumors in all of the dogs were confirmed as completely resected on histopathological examination. Two dogs received toceranib following the surgery. The median follow-up time was 693 days (range, 420-1386 days), with a median survival time of 894 days (range, 420-1386 days). Local recurrence or distant metastases were detected in two of the six dogs (33%) on 354 and 398 days following surgery, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 492 days (range, 354-1386 days).

However, such tests are associated with increased morbidity and cost. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine if spleen cytology was predictive of liver cytology in canine MCTs and if any patient or tumor variables were associated with spleen and/or liver metastasis. Records of dogs with MCTs and cytology of spleen and liver were reviewed. Two hundred five patients were included. Overall, 22 (10.7%) patients had metastasis, with 21 (10.2%) and 13 (6.3%) having spleen and liver metastasis, respectively, and 12 (5.9%) having both. For patients with a positive (or negative) spleen cytology, the odds ratio of having a positive (or negative) liver cytology was 233.49. However, a negative spleen cytology had a higher predictive value (0.99) than a positive cytology (0.54). Finally, the presence of local and systemic signs and tumor size were associated with spleen, liver, and/or spleen or liver metastasis. These results suggest that spleen cytology is predictive of liver cytology in staging of canine MCTs, and increasing tumor size and presence of local or systemic signs are associated with an increased risk of visceral metastasis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spleen</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate complete blood count and blood smear alterations and to describe their relationship with, and incidence of comorbid diseases in, diabetic dogs. Three-hundred twelve diabetic dogs, 286 dogs diagnosed with systemic, nondiabetic illnesses, and 506 healthy dogs were identified during the study period. Groups were compared using contingency tables and logistic regression. Associations between statistically significant complete blood count and blood smear alterations and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable analysis. High-grade codocytosis and anisocytosis were identified more frequently in diabetic dogs, whereas high-grade reactive lymphocytosis and keratocytosis were identified less frequently (P &lt; .001). Diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis had lower red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit and higher white blood cell counts (P &lt; .001). Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed more frequently in diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis when compared with those with low-grade codocytosis (P &lt; .001) or when compared with any other cell morphologic alterations.

Mesothelioma arising from the MSC in two dogs is described. Both dogs presented with acute life-threatening hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Contrast computed tomography revealed a large solitary spherical-to-cylindrical tumor in the caudal mediastinum with variably thick, contrast-enhancing walls with lobular to frond-like proliferations that arose circumferentially and projected internally into a single, variably sized, fluid-attenuating lumen. The wall and lumen corresponded to the serous membrane and serous cavity of the MSC. Surgical exploration confirmed that both tumors arose from the mediastinum. Both had similar histologic findings, and special stains were necessary for definitive diagnosis. The tumor was nonresectable in one dog, and it was euthanized intraoperatively. The other survived 7 mo. An MSC mesothelioma should be considered a possible cause of hemothorax in dogs that may be detected on thoracic radiography and computed tomography. Differential diagnoses include esophageal foreign body or neoplasm, paraesophageal diaphragmatic hernia, MCS empyema, and pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with thoracic computed tomography helping to rule out foreign body and diaphragmatic hernia.

Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary with all procedures, which has been shown previously with a variety of human and veterinary surgeries. Medical records were retrospectively evaluated for cases who had a cutaneous punch biopsy performed between 2013 and 2018 including the following information: species, signalment, concurrent diseases, concurrent medications, location of biopsy, histopathologic diagnosis, and bacterial infections postoperatively. The prevalence of secondary infections, due to punch biopsies in all animals, was 1.9% and further divided into 2.3% (3/128) of dogs and 0% (0/26) of cats. It was determined that the relative risk of developing complications from punch biopsy was 0.06 (0.01-0.93) when diagnosing a dermatologic disease versus a cutaneous mass (neoplastic and nonneoplastic), which was statistically significant. The risk increased 2.16 (0.16-59.91) times if the biopsy site was the trunk, which includes the neck, thorax, and abdomen. These results indicate that in veterinary medicine, postoperative complications are uncommon with cutaneous punch biopsies. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics in dogs and cats is unnecessary when performing a punch biopsy when there is no infection present at the time of biopsy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacterial Infections</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Postoperative Complications</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the efficacy of the early initiation of chemotherapy in combination with HRT (HRTC) to prolong the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in cats with localized sinonasal lymphoma compared with HRT alone. While 24 eligible cats received HRT alone (HRT group), 18 received HRTC (HRTC group). The total median administered dose was 35 Gy, with one fraction per week, for a median of five fractions. In the HRTC group, the chemotherapy protocol was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP)-based and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (COP)-based in 14 (78%) and 4 cats (22%), respectively. Cats in the HRTC group had significantly longer PFS (677 versus 104 days; P = .04) and OS (983 versus 263 days; P = .04) than those in the HRT group. Considering the poor outcome in the HRT group despite the cats having received rescue chemotherapy for progressive disease, the early initiation of additional chemotherapy along with HRT may be recommended for feline localized sinonasal lymphoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cyclophosphamide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Disease-Free Survival</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Doxorubicin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisolone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vincristine</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Whole and sedimented urine samples from 116 client-owned dogs were analyzed with reagent strips from four manufacturers. Results for LE and nitrite were recorded every 30 s up to 150 s using "trace" and "+" positive thresholds and compared to microscopic urine sediment analysis and culture results. Sedimented urine assessed at 150 s with a "trace" positive threshold for LE had significantly or trending higher sensitivity (brand dependent) for pyuria detection compared with manufacturer recommendations. Using these parameters, LE sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio were 66.67-89.47%, and 0.13-0.37, respectively. Following manufacturer recommendations, LE specificity and positive likelihood ratio were 96.91-100% and 17.02-30.63, respectively. Nitrite performance for pyuria and bacteriuria detection was poor for all conditions. LE reagent pads are a useful screening test for pyuria detection using sedimented urine and a "trace" positive threshold at 150 s, whereas LE use with traditional manufacturer recommendations is a good confirmatory test for pyuria detection. Nitrite reagent pads are not useful for pyuria or bacteriuria detection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Bacteriuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nitrites</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyuria</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Reagent Strips</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urinary Tract Infections</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

This observational pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation (IRE) balloon therapy for the palliative treatment of TCC with partial urethral obstruction. Three client-owned dogs diagnosed with TCC causing partial urethral obstruction were enrolled. After ultrasonographic and cystoscopic examination, IRE pulse protocols were delivered through a balloon catheter device inflated within the urethral lumen. After the procedure, the patients were kept overnight for monitoring and a recheck was planned 28 days later. No complication was observed during the procedure and postprocedural monitoring. After 28 days, one dog had a complete normalization of the urine stream, one dog had stable stranguria, and one dog was presented with a urethral obstruction secondary to progression of the TCC. On recheck ultrasound, one dog had a 38% diminution of the urethral mass diameter whereas the other two dogs had a mass stable in size. IRE balloon therapy seems to be a feasible and apparently safe minimally invasive novel therapy for the palliative treatment of TCC causing urethral obstruction. Further studies are needed to better characterize the safety, efficacy, and outcome of this therapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Carcinoma, Transitional Cell</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Electroporation</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Palliative Care</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Urethral Obstruction</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36049241</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines.</Title>	<Abstract>These guidelines are an update and extension of previous AAHA peer-reviewed canine vaccination guidelines published in 2017. Vaccination is a cornerstone of canine preventive healthcare and one of the most cost-effective ways of maintaining a dog's health, longevity, and quality of life. Canine vaccination also serves a public health function by forming a barrier against several zoonotic diseases affecting dogs and humans. Canine vaccines are broadly categorized as containing core and noncore immunizing antigens, with administration recommendations based on assessment of individual patient risk factors. The guidelines include a comprehensive table listing canine core and noncore vaccines and a recommended vaccination and revaccination schedule for each vaccine. The guidelines explain the relevance of different vaccine formulations, including those containing modified-live virus, inactivated, and recombinant immunizing agents. Factors that potentially affect vaccine efficacy are addressed, including the patient's prevaccination immune status and vaccine duration of immunity. Because animal shelters are one of the most challenging environments for prevention and control of infectious diseases, the guidelines also provide recommendations for vaccination of dogs presented at or housed in animal shelters, including the appropriate response to an infectious disease outbreak in the shelter setting. The guidelines explain how practitioners can interpret a patient's serological status, including maternally derived antibody titers, as indicators of immune status and suitability for vaccination. Other topics covered include factors associated with postvaccination adverse events, vaccine storage and handling to preserve product efficacy, interpreting product labeling to ensure proper vaccine use, and using client education and healthcare team training to raise awareness of the importance of vaccinations.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccination</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Vaccines</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Medical records (2012-2016) of client-owned dogs (n = 9) and cats (n = 3) treated with MLT at one institution were retrospectively reviewed. Retrieved data included the signalment, indications, physical examination findings, laboratory results, methods of leeching, outcomes, and complications associated with MLT. Following MLT sessions, nine patients (75%) visibly showed clear improvement of the affected tissue. One patient (8%) was euthanized before complete healing owing to pulmonary parenchymal disease. Improvement or appearance of tissue following MLT was not recorded in two patients (17%). Results suggest that MLT may be a safe and effective treatment modality for venous congestion and necrosis in compromised skin flaps and wounds with success in resolving 75% of the lesions in this study. This study is suggestive of the value of MLT when more conventional treatment methods fail in dogs and cats. A data collection form was created for veterinarians to use with the goal of obtaining standardized, objective MLT data for future studies.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Leeching</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Surgical Flaps</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The working hypothesis was that both techniques (EMBLOCK and LGEL) similarly blunt the cardiovascular responses to the stimulation. Six beagles were anesthetized using alfaxalone and isoflurane on three occasions with each treatment (EMBLOCK, LGEL, and control) in random order. The nasal cavity from the nose tip to the medial canthus was stimulated with a standard-tip cotton swab, and cardiovascular variables were recorded before and after stimulation. The maximum increases in heart rate and blood pressure were significantly smaller in EMBLOCK and LGEL than in the control. There was no significant difference between EMBLOCK and LGEL. Therefore, although further clinical studies are required, EMBLOCK and LGEL can be used because both EMBLOCK and LGEL attenuated the cardiovascular response to mechanical stimulation of the nasal cavity in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lidocaine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Maxillary Nerve</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Isoflurane</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blood Pressure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Rate</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Decreased serum thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations had been confirmed at a primary clinic, but no treatment was initiated. Serum biochemistries revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol concentrations. An adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulating test revealed elevated preserum and postserum cortisol concentrations. Fluoroscopy revealed marked epiglottic retroversion (ER) during inhalation. Enlarged bilateral adrenal glands were found on abdominal ultrasonography. Based on these findings, ER and hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) were diagnosed and surgical correction of the ER was planned. Trilostane administration was initiated before surgery to reduce the risk of thrombosis due to HAC. Seven days after the initiation of trilostane therapy, clinical signs of chronic respiratory compromise were resolved. The patient had remained clinically stable without recurrence of respiratory compromise for at least 15 mo at the time of this case report. This case suggests that HAC could contribute to the development of clinical signs of ER, which could potentially be successfully controlled by medical treatment of HAC.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocortical Hyperfunction</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenocorticotropic Hormone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dihydrotestosterone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hydrocortisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Ultrasonography</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

An upper respiratory endoscopic examination and a computed tomographic scan showed a well-circumscribed, fluid-filled nasopharyngeal mass located in the median plane on the nasal side of the soft palate. This lesion was removed using a ventral approach to the nasopharynx by blunt-sharp dissection from the submucosal tissues of the soft palate. Histopathology revealed a cystic lesion lined by a single layer of a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium, characteristic of a pharyngeal cyst. Follow-up 5 mo after surgery revealed complete resolution of the clinical signs with no evidence of local recurrence. Pharyngeal cysts are developmental abnormalities of the branchial apparatus. Most derive from the second branchial arch and cause cysts, sinuses, and fistulae to develop in the neck region. In our case, the lesion was located in the nasopharynx, leading to snoring and exercise intolerance. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis of suspected nasopharyngeal obstruction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Branchioma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Branchial Region</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Snoring</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nasopharynx</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Electromyography revealed complex repetitive discharges in multiple muscle groups. Immunofluorescence of biopsies confirmed dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. This is the first report describing dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy in the Brittany breed. Currently, no specific therapies are available for this form of myopathy. The presence of dystrophin deficiency in the two dogs suggests an inherited myopathy rather than a spontaneous mutation.

Several mechanisms have been described to explain the cardiac effects of primary adrenal insufficiency, but, clinically, these manifestations may be underappreciated in dogs. In humans, there is an infrequently described, reversible dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with hypoadrenocorticism. Two dogs were presented to a single referral center for evaluation of weakness or collapse and were subsequently diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism after a full diagnostic workup. Following the diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism and administration of glucocorticoids and desoxycorticosterone pivalate, both dogs developed left-sided congestive heart failure and had systolic dysfunction diagnosed by echocardiogram. Both dogs were euthanized; one because of recurrent congestive heart failure and another because of a concern for poor long-term prognosis and decreased quality of life. The purpose of this case report is to document multiple cases of hypoadrenocorticism-associated systolic dysfunction and subsequent cardiogenic pulmonary edema in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Adrenal Insufficiency</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Failure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cardiomyopathies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

We hypothesized that LHR would be expressed in canine mast cell tumors (MCTs) and that more neoplastic mast cells would express LHR in gonadectomized dogs compared with intact dogs. Eleven archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cutaneous MCT tissue sections were processed using routine immunohistochemistry. For both the KIT protein and LHR, the percentage of positive cells for each staining pattern (I-III) was calculated. A Student's t test was used to compare the total percentage of positive cells expressing LHR and KIT in intact and gonadectomized dogs. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the percentage of cells within each staining pattern for LHR and KIT in intact and gonadectomized dogs. All MCT expressed LHR. MCT from gonadectomized dogs had a significantly higher percentage of LHR-positive mast cells (84.2 &#177; 8.7%) compared with MCTs from intact dogs (64.3 &#177; 4.2%). This is the first study to demonstrate the expression of LHR in canine MCTs and to report that LHR expression is increased in neoplastic mast cells from gonadectomized dogs compared with intact dogs.

A medical records search was performed to identify dogs presenting with ocular complaints initially noted within 24 hr of a commercial grooming appointment. Data collected included signalment, type of injury, treatment, and notations regarding behavioral issues potentially contributing to injury. One hundred sixty-one episodes involving 159 dogs were identified. Male dogs accounted for 57% of episodes. Median age at presentation was 59 mo. Shih tzu were involved in 34% of incidents, and 71% involved small-breed dogs. Aggressive or reactive behaviors were reported in 33% of dogs. Corneal ulceration was the most common injury (71% of incidents), followed by conjunctivitis (11%), eyelid lacerations (7%), and subconjunctival hemorrhage (6%). Surgical management was required in 14% of cases, including four dogs that underwent enucleation. Ocular injury during grooming appointments can occur via several mechanisms including trauma, exposure to grooming products, or inadvertent strangulation. Small-breed dogs, particularly shih tzu, appear to be at increased risk. Reactive or aggressive behavior likely increases risk of ocular injury. Veterinarians can help limit grooming-associated ocular injuries by recommending behavioral or pharmacological interventions before grooming visits.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Grooming</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eyelids</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

The objective of this pilot study was to determine the efficacy of a 0.003% colloidal silver nanoparticle-based shampoo in the treatment of canine Malassezia dermatitis. Dogs were included based on compatible history, presentation, and at least one positive cytology. Fourteen privately owned dogs were bathed every 48 hr for up to 28 days, allowing 5-10 min of contact time. The mean Malassezia organisms for 10 oil immersion fields at each Malassezia dermatitis-affected body area was recorded at days 0 and 14. Dogs positive on day 14 had cytologies performed on day 28. Eleven dogs (78.6%) were cytologically negative by day 28. Nine (81.8%) of these were negative by day 14. One dog (7.14%) had partial resolution (negative in 3/4 Malassezia dermatitis areas) by day 28. These results suggest that silver nanoparticle-based shampoo may be effective in the treatment of canine Malassezia dermatitis.

A left thyroidectomy and right cranial parathyroidectomy were performed. Hypocalcemia and anemia developed postoperatively, which were managed with calcium carbonate, calcitriol, and calcium gluconate and benign neglect of anemia. Histopathology was consistent with a left thyroid carcinoma and right cranial parathyroid adenoma.

Nineteen days after HSA administration, the dog developed peracute high magnitude renal proteinuria and AKI. Rapid immunosuppression, using a combination of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, resulted in full resolution of AKI, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria.

Although this condition is reported in 2-3 mo old puppies, tetanus has not been described in neonates. Herein, we report the clinical signs of 3-5 day old American Bully puppies from the same litter, presenting with an acute onset of marked generalized stiffness of the extensor muscles, trismus, and an inability to suckle. Three puppies died because of tetanus: one died during consultation, one was euthanized owing to respiratory distress, and the third died 1 mo after initial presentation following deterioration. All three of these puppies were clinically affected by omphalitis. Complete bloodwork, toxicological screening (including strychnine assay), serology, and polymerase chain reaction tests for selected infectious diseases were unremarkable. Necropsy of the euthanized puppy confirmed suppurative omphalitis, which may have contributed to C. tetani infection.

In age-adjusted analysis, each additional inch of precipitation 3 mo before diagnosis was associated with an increase in the odds of developing Lyme nephritis (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.25). The results suggest that increased precipitation is a possible risk factor for Lyme nephritis in dogs. These findings may provide useful information for the accurate diagnosis of dogs with protein-losing nephropathy and may guide future studies of risk factors for Lyme nephritis. The methodology employed here reinforces the concept that case-crossover designs have utility beyond acute exposures and outcomes and offer an attractive alternative for studies in companion animals.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Over Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Nephritis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Risk Factors</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lyme Disease</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>36584316</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Eyes Instead of Ears: Eye Injuries Following Ocular Exposure to Otic Medications.</Title>	<Abstract>To determine the epidemiology of ocular exposures and toxicoses in dogs and cats from otic products, 79 dog and cat cases with an ocular exposure to a topical otic medication were retrieved from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Animal Poison Control Center database. Prescription products were involved in 75/79 (95%) of cases, and over-the-counter products in 4 (5%). Clinical signs included conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, epiphora, ocular discharge, and corneal ulceration. Medication error, specifically involving mistaken identification (i.e., an otic product confused with an ophthalmic product), occurred in 68/79 (86%) of cases. In 4 of these 68 cases, an otic instead of an ophthalmic medication was mistakenly dispensed to the pet owner. Unintentional delivery (i.e., accidental ocular exposure in the course of an otic application) occurred in 9/79 (11%) of cases, and 2 (3%) cases involved intentional delivery of otic products to the eyes. Because mistaken identification was the most common cause of ocular toxicoses from otic products, separate storage and/or distinctive packaging for ophthalmic versus otic products could reduce medication errors. Animal poison control center epidemiological data can be used as a source of information regarding veterinary medication errors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>United States</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Corneal Ulcer</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Eye Injuries</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Head</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small liver with mixed echogenicity, small hypoechoic nodules, and an irregular surface. Histologic examination and copper quantification of the liver obtained by laparoscopy diagnosed copper-associated hepatitis. One month later the dog developed hyperkeratosis of all four foot pads and ulcerations of feet, legs, and rectum. Punch biopsies confirmed superficial necrolytic dermatitis. After a total of 2 mo of chelation with no changes to medications, skin lesions began to improve, continuing over the following 6 wk to almost complete resolution. At this point the skin lesions returned and had minimal response to four amino acids infusions. The dog was switched from penicillamine to trientine. Zinc acetate was initiated 6 wk after the switch to trientine, and skin improvement was noted soon thereafter. At the time of death, skin lesions were improving and the dog was clinically comfortable. Copper-associated hepatitis should be considered as a possible etiology for superficial necrolytic dermatitis. Treatment of superficial necrolytic dermatitis is often unrewarding, and copper chelation, when copper-associated hepatitis has been confirmed, represents another therapeutic option.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dermatitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Copper</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Trientine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Skin Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hepatitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Examination revealed nonambulatory paraparesis and thoracolumbar hyperesthesia. MRI revealed extensive intramedullary T2-weighted/short tau inversion recovery hyperintensity and diffuse severe T1-post contrast meningeal enhancement of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. An L5-L6 cerebrospinal fluid sample revealed a suppurative pleocytosis (81% neutrophils, total protein 4362.5 mg/dL and nucleated cell count 352,000/&#956;L). While awaiting the results of infectious disease testing, the dog was treated for suspected meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology with corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and a cytarabine arabinoside infusion. The dog neurologically declined and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The dog continued to decline despite antibiotics, and infectious disease titers subsequently revealed serum antibody positivity for blastomycosis. The dog was then referred to a multispecialty referral hospital and was treated with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Prednisone was continued at anti-inflammatory doses. Urine blastomycosis antigen testing was submitted for subsequent disease monitoring but was negative. Five months after presentation the dog was clinically doing well with no identifiable neurologic deficits. This case demonstrates that neurologic blastomycosis may have negative urine antigen concentrations in some dogs and that other diagnostic modalities should be pursued when central nervous system fungal disease is suspected.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Blastomycosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Central Nervous System</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Physical examination revealed right popliteal lymphadenopathy and a fungating mass of the right pelvic limb at the level of the hock. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography revealed mild lymphadenopathy of multiple iliac and inguinal lymph nodes. Right pelvic limb amputation and inguinal lymphadenectomy were performed. Histopathology was consistent of a high-grade soft tissue sarcoma with diffuse spread through the lymphatic vessels of the right pelvic limb up to the right inguinal lymph node but not affecting the lymph node itself. Doxorubicin chemotherapy was elected postoperatively as adjuvant therapy. Approximately 4 mo following initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed a firm, tubular subcutaneous mass starting near the previous amputation site with tracking toward the thorax. Fine needle aspiration of the new mass was consistent with atypical spindle cell proliferation. Palliative care was elected, and the patient was euthanized 3 mo later because of progressive disease. In-transit metastasis is a rare behavior for soft tissue sarcomas across all species, and this is the first report of such a presentation for canine soft tissue sarcoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphatic Metastasis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sarcoma</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymph Nodes</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lymphadenopathy</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Little information is provided in the literature evaluating the sensitivity/specificity of FNA cytology for solitary liver masses. We hypothesized that liver lesion size nor the presence of cavitation would impact the success of cytological diagnosis. Medical records were obtained for 220 client-owned dogs. Inclusion criteria included preoperative abdominal imaging, percutaneous FNA of a solitary hepatic mass with cytologic interpretation by a board-certified pathologist, and a surgical biopsy or mass excision yielding a histopathological diagnosis. Six dogs (2.7%) experienced a complication after FNA, none considered severe. The agreement rate for correct cytologic diagnosis was 22.9% (49/220). Of the neoplastic masses 18.9% (35/185) were correctly diagnosed via cytology. The overall sensitivity was 60%, and the specificity was 68.6%. Neither institution (P = 0.16), lesion size (P = 0.88), cavitation (P = 0.34), or needle gauge (P = 0.20) had an association with correct diagnosis. This study demonstrates that, although there is a low risk of complications following FNA of a hepatic mass, overall success rate for correct cytologic diagnosis based on FNA was low compared to histopathologic diagnosis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Biopsy, Fine-Needle</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Liver Neoplasms</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, clients may have the perception that older dogs and cats undergo an unavoidable physical, mental, and behavioral decline attributable simply to old age. The veterinary team's role includes providing medical care and support to senior pets to maintain their quality of life, as well as supporting and educating clients on proper senior animal care and addressing any misconceptions about the aging process. These Guidelines describe a systematic approach to the healthcare of the senior pet that is based on an evidence-guided assessment of both healthy and unhealthy canine and feline patients. By using evidence-guided medicine, which may include conventional and integrative approaches as well as environmental management for the senior pet, the patient's quality of life can be enhanced and potentially extended during this vulnerable life stage. Developing a senior program for the veterinary practice requires appropriate training of the entire healthcare team and includes a robust client education program that focuses on the wellbeing of the senior pet. Palliative and hospice care should be included in the education and information provided for both the veterinary team and the families of senior pets.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Quality of Life</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

En route to the hospital for treatment, the owners noted the queen stopped breathing. On presentation, cardiopulmonary arrest was confirmed. The exact cause was unknown but suspected to be secondary to acute fulminant congestive heart failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a large volume of serosanguineous fluid within the mouth and nose. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately started. After 2 min of CPR without return of spontaneous circulation, the owners consented to perimortem Cesarean section. Two kittens were removed via emergency hysterotomy within 3-4 min. Both kittens were successfully resuscitated. CPR efforts were continued on the queen for 2 min after delivery of the kittens, at which time the owners elected to stop further resuscitative efforts. Both kittens were discharged from the hospital and were alive at last follow-up, 2 yr and 4 mo after birth. There are no previous reports regarding the use of a perimortem Cesarean section to deliver neonates in small animal medicine. Therefore, this report represents a novel treatment approach that can be considered in the case of maternal arrest during dystocia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pregnancy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cesarean Section</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dystocia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Heart Failure</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Law Enforcement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Twenty-two client-owned normal healthy dogs (8 female spayed, 12 male castrated, 2 male intact) without history of urinary abnormalities were included. Dogs were walked outside for 5 min to allow for natural voiding, immediately followed by urinary bladder ultrasound and urinary catheterization. The URV was recorded, and the ultrasound images were used to estimate URV for each dog. There was no significant difference between male and female URV; therefore, all data were pooled. With a 90% confidence interval, URV was 0-0.47 mL/kg with a mean URV of 0.21 mL/kg and a median value of 0.175 mL/kg. There was no significant difference between the measured URV and the ultrasound-determined URV. This case series supports previously established normal URV in the dog; however, a reference interval based on a larger population of dogs with further evaluation of body size/weight, sex, and neuter status is recommended to be established for use in clinical setting to differentiate normal urination from urinary retention in patients.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Residual Volume</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Body Size</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pelvis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Records</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

There is no veterinary literature directly evaluating the outcome of patients with septic peritonitis caused by neoplasia. The objective of this study was to evaluate for differences in survival to discharge and complication rates between septic peritonitis caused by neoplastic and nonneoplastic disease in canine patients. A single-institution retrospective cross-sectional cohort study was performed, identifying dogs that were treated surgically for septic peritonitis between January 1, 2010, and November 1, 2020. A total of 86 patients were included, 12 with a neoplastic cause for septic peritonitis and 74 with another cause. The most common neoplastic lesions associated with septic peritonitis were gastrointestinal lymphoma and hepatocellular adenoma. Presence of neoplasia was not a significant factor for development of intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications, nor did it decrease chances of survival to discharge (P &lt; .09). The diagnosis of a primary, localized, neoplastic lesion alone should not deter clinicians and owners from pursuing treatment for septic peritonitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cross-Sectional Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Neoplasms</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Peritonitis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Treatment Outcome</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

In this prospective, observational cohort study of 14 dogs with presumptive PLE and ultrasonographic evidence of lymphangiectasia, subjects were placed on various low-fat diets as monotherapy and prednisone was added if response was deemed inadequate. Dogs were assessed and scored at four recheck examinations across a 6 mo study period, including a final recheck ultrasound. Clinical and clinicopathologic variables were collected and dogs were divided into three outcome groups: clinical remission on dietary monotherapy (LOF); clinical remission on dietary therapy plus immunosuppressive prednisone (LOP); and treatment failure (TXF). Eleven of 14 dogs were in clinical remission at the study end date (6 mo after enrollment): 6 LOF dogs and 5 LOP dogs. LOF dogs achieved a significant reduction in Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index score and a significant increase in serum albumin within 2 wk of beginning dietary monotherapy. Four of 11 dogs in remission also had ultrasonographic evidence of resolution of linear striations. Low-fat diet appears to be an effective monotherapy in some dogs with presumptive PLE and ultrasonographic evidence of lymphangiectasia.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diet, Fat-Restricted</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prednisone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Protein-Losing Enteropathies</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

A PCR technique with capsulorrhaphy was performed in all dogs using acetabular screws with washers and a femoral tunnel as anchor points for the polyester prosthetic ligament. A non-weight-bearing sling was not placed. Minimum 1 yr follow-up period was required for study inclusion. Two major complications (13.3%) consisting of craniodorsal hip reluxation (n = 1) and capital physeal fracture (n = 1) were observed. Minor complications (superficial skin necrosis) occurred in one case (6.7 %). The patient with craniodorsal hip reluxation underwent femoral head and neck ostectomy and was excluded from long-term analysis. In the 11 cases that returned for long-term (median, 3.8 yr; range, 19-75 mo) evaluation at the authors' institution, 10/11 of the dogs were clinically sound. Three dogs did not return for long-term evaluation. However, telephone interview with owners minimum1 yr after surgery indicated normal limb function and absence of complications in all three cases. These results suggest that PCR with polyester prosthetic ligament can be successful in maintaining hip reduction in dogs with craniodorsal hip luxation.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Extremities</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Polyesters</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Lesion localization was C6-T2 spinal cord segments, worse on the right. Radiographic imaging of the cervical spine revealed a microchip at the location of the C7-T1 intervertebral space. Computed tomography revealed a microchip within the spinal canal causing spinal cord compression at the level of the C7-T1 intervertebral disc space. Surgical removal of the microchip was performed, and the patient recovered well. A 6 wk follow-up neurologic examination showed persistent mild ataxia in the pelvic limbs. This case supports previously reported cases of permanent spinal cord damage caused by microchip placement. Surgical removal of the microchip resulted in the improvement of neurologic signs.

A 5 yr old spayed female Shetland sheepdog and a 5 yr old female Shetland sheepdog were evaluated following accidental ingestion of a joint supplement. Consultation with a toxicologist revealed concern for manganese toxicosis resulting in hepatic injury. Both dogs developed subsequent acute liver injury, despite decontamination and initial management with N-acetylcysteine and cholestyramine. The patients were managed with calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, paraaminosalicylic acid, allopurinol, Vitamin E, ginkgo biloba, and S-adenosylmethionine/silybin. Liver values returned to normal in both dogs. Manganese exposure was confirmed with urine manganese analysis in one dog and fecal examination in the other dog.

Forty-five client-owned dogs undergoing general anesthesia for surgery or imaging scan were included; weights ranged from 2.5 to 42.6 kg. Agreement between paired IBP and OBP during normotension was verified with reference standards used in small animals and humans. The data were stratified by body weight (&#8804;5 kg versus &gt;5 kg). In the &gt;5 kg group (n = 29), the bias &#177; standard deviation for mean (2.1 &#177; 7.9 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (-2.7 &#177; 7.9 mm Hg) exhibited reliability that met human standards (&lt;5 &#177; 8 mm Hg). However, in the &#8804;5 kg group (n = 16), the bias &#177; standard deviation met only veterinary standards (&#8804;10 &#177; 15 mm Hg) for mean (3.1 &#177; 10.2 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (-2.5 &#177; 12.6 mm Hg). Agreement for systolic pressure did not meet either standard for both groups.

Physical examination revealed significant pain on palpation of the caudal sternum where an approximately 8 &#215; 6 cm contusion was noted. Sedated thoracic radiographs revealed a luxated fifth intersternebral joint with the sixth sternebra being cranioventrally displaced (along with the seventh and eight sternebrae) to the level of the mid fourth sternebra. There were sharply marginated, short oblique fractures of the distal sixth costal cartilages bilaterally with mild dorsal displacement of the distal segment. The sternal luxation was palpated more aggressively once the patient was sedated and deemed to be stable. Because of the stability of the luxation and absence of sternebral fractures, conservative medical management in the form of analgesics and rest was instituted. Repeat thoracic radiographs 2 wk after presentation revealed an unchanged sternal luxation. Twelve months after presentation, the patient presented for an unrelated lameness and, in that timeframe, has exhibited no sequelae to the sternal luxation, which still palpates stable and is radiographically unchanged.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Sternum</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fractures, Bone</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Radiography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pain</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cat Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Neurological examinations were consistent with left-sided lesions between spinal cord segments C1 and C5. Orthogonal radiographs of the cervical spine showed a microchip dorsoventrally oriented, partially embedded in the cervical vertebral canal. Fluoroscopy was used to localize and retrieve the foreign body from the cervical spinal cord in each case. Improvement in clinical condition and return to ambulation was observed in both cats within 48 hr of surgical removal of the implant. No significant perioperative adverse events were noted during the surgical retrieval of the microchip. Two previously reported cases of intraspinal canal microchip placement had been treated surgically by hemilaminectomy. This approach carries a risk of complications, including hemorrhage from the venous sinus, iatrogenic damage to the spinal cord, and improper identification of the surgical site, requires advanced surgical training, and typically has an extended surgical time. The use of fluoroscopy to assist intraoperative localization of a spinal canal foreign body may lessen the requirement for more invasive surgical procedures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluoroscopy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Cord</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Cervical Vertebrae</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Foreign Bodies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Spinal Canal</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

On physical examination, a nodular mass at the fourth mammary gland level was observed. Neurological evaluation showed obtundation and compulsive behavior. Brain MRI study did not reveal any abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from the cerebellomedullary cistern showed a marked increase of total nucleated cell count (400 cells/&#956;L). Cytological evaluation identified the presence of a monomorphic round cell population characterized by large cell bodies, a single eccentrical located nucleus with high nuclear:cytoplasmatic ratio, and marked atypia with anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, and multiple nucleoli. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) was suspected. The dog was euthanatized for worsening of clinical signs. Post-mortem examination identified an anaplastic mammary carcinoma in the nodular mammary mass. Infiltration by neoplastic cells exhibiting the same morphological features was detected along leptomeninges of the telencephalon and cerebellum associated with cortical and subcortical parenchymal micrometastases. To our knowledge, this is the first case of LC in a dog detected by CSF evaluation but without any MRI abnormalities. This finding emphasizes the usefulness of CSF cytology in patients with suspected LC even in the absence of any MRI identifiable lesions.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Female</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Meningeal Carcinomatosis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Computed tomography revealed marked pleural and pericardial effusion, thickening of the pericardium caudally, and a mass along the mediastinum. Pericardial fluid obtained via pericardiocentesis showed suppurative inflammation with mixed anaerobic bacteria isolated on culture. Subtotal pericardiectomy and partial lung lobectomy was performed to treat septic pericarditis. Postoperative echocardiogram showed increased right-sided pressures consistent with constrictive epicarditis, and 10 days after surgery, the dog was re-presented for right-sided heart failure. An epicardectomy was performed. A definitive source of infection was not identified, although a penetrating foreign body (e.g., grass awn) was suspected. The dog recovered and 10 yr follow up revealed no evidence of constrictive pathology on echocardiogram.

This study aimed to evaluate the indications for the use of TXA and EACA in cats and to describe dosing regimens used, occurrence of adverse events, and patient outcomes. This was a retrospective multicenter study. Medical databases were searched for feline patients billed for TXA or EACA between 2015 and 2021. Thirty-five cats met the inclusion criteria; 86% received TXA and 14% received EACA. The most common indication was nontraumatic hemorrhage (54%), followed by traumatic hemorrhage (17%) and elective surgery (11%). The median dose was 10 mg/kg for TXA and 50 mg/kg for EACA. Overall, 52% of cats survived to discharge. Potential adverse events were noted in 7/35 (20%) patients. Of these, 29% survived to discharge. No standardized dosing regimen was identified; rather, dose, dosing interval, and duration of administration varied markedly between patients. Administration was potentially associated with severe adverse events, although the retrospective design makes it difficult to establish a causal association with antifibrinolytic use. This study provides a base for future prospective studies by giving an insight into the use of antifibrinolytic drugs in cats.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Cats</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antifibrinolytic Agents</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Prospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aminocaproic Acid</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tranexamic Acid</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Many studies combine dogs with varying tumor grades, clinical stage, or treatments, confounding those results. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine outcome and prognostic factors in a specific subset of dogs with high-grade, stage 2, cutaneous MCTs treated with adequate local control via surgery with or without radiation therapy and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy. Seventeen dogs met the inclusion criteria, and the median survival time was 259 days. Development of local recurrence, tumor location, and presence of ulceration were all associated with shorter survival times. Tumor size, mitotic count, chemotherapy protocol, lymph node classification, and radiation therapy were not significantly associated with outcome. In this study, a specific population of dogs characterized by high-grade MCTs with local lymph node metastasis who received aggressive local and systemic therapy had a median survival of about 8.5 mo. Dogs with ulcerated tumors, recurrent tumors, or tumors located on the head had a worse outcome despite aggressive therapy. These results may serve as a basis of comparison for future research exploring alternative treatment combinations in this specific population of dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Mast Cells</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Aggression</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Megaesophagus is the most common focal form of MG. Although exacerbation of MG has been associated with the use of fluoroquinolones in humans, it has not been previously described in dogs. The medical records of 46 dogs diagnosed with MG based on acetylcholine receptor antibody testing from 1997 to 2021 were retrospectively evaluated to identify any dogs who demonstrated exacerbation of MG after the administration of a fluoroquinolone. Exacerbation of MG, from focal to generalized, occurred in a median of 4.5 days after initiation of fluoroquinolone therapy in six dogs. In addition, one dog with generalized MG and megaesophagus developed pyridostigmine resistance subsequent to fluoroquinolone therapy. Marked improvement in generalized weakness was reported 36 hr after discontinuation of fluoroquinolone therapy alone in one dog and in combination with pyridostigmine in two dogs. Fluoroquinolone therapy was never stopped in three dogs who were euthanized because of severe weakness and one dog who died of respiratory arrest.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pyridostigmine Bromide</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Esophageal Achalasia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myasthenia Gravis</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fluoroquinolones</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Receptors, Cholinergic</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

However, data comparing the accuracy of conventional IV contrast-injected computed tomography (CT) and myelography CT for hemilaminectomy localization and size assessment are sparse. In this study, IV contrast-injected CT and myelography CT were performed in 48 French bulldogs presenting with acute disc herniation and compared with postsurgical CT. CT images were evaluated by three raters. IV contrast-injected CT erroneously identified the compressive lesion site significantly more often than myelography CT. The length of the compressive lesion was significantly higher using myelography CT compared with conventional CT, but this did not lead to relevant consequences on the surgical opening site length. Myelography CT should therefore be recommended when thoracolumbar disc disease is suspected and multiple compressive lesions are visualized on IV-injected CT in French bulldogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc Displacement</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Myelography</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Tomography, X-Ray Computed</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Laminectomy</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intervertebral Disc</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Compounded solutions of enrofloxacin are commonly used in practice to treat bacterial OE; however, the tolerability of different concentrations of this antibiotic in the ear canals of dogs has not been evaluated. The objective of this study is to determine if a higher concentration of enrofloxacin applied to the external ear canal is clinically tolerated in dogs with healthy ears. Sixteen client-owned dogs with bilateral healthy ears and no previous history of OE were enrolled. Injectable enrofloxacin 2.27% diluted with sterile sodium chloride in 1:1 (11.35 mg/mL) and 2:1 (15 mg/mL) ratios were applied into the dogs' right and left ears, respectively, q 12 hr for 14 days. Based on video otoscopic examination, clinical score for canine OE (OTIS3) results before application were &#8804;1 for all dogs. During the study and at the conclusion, all scores remained &#8804;2, which is considered normal. No cytologic inflammatory cells were seen in any of the dogs' ears throughout the study. Different concentrations of enrofloxacin solution applied topically were well tolerated by dogs with healthy ears and can be considered for the treatment of dogs with bacterial OE.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Enrofloxacin</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anti-Bacterial Agents</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Chemotherapy (lomustine 60 mg/m2 by mouth as a single dose) and glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone &#8764;20 mg/m2 by mouth every 24 hr) were initiated. Progressive disease occurred 21 days after lomustine administration. Doxorubicin (at 30 mg/m2 IV every 3 wk) was administered as a second-line therapy. Prednisone was continued at the same dose. Partial response was noted 1 wk after initiation of doxorubicin and sustained through doxorubicin #2. Complete remission was achieved following doxorubicin #3 (63 days from the start of doxorubicin rescue therapy). Progressive disease was noted after doxorubicin #5, for a total duration of response to doxorubicin of 105 days. Further rescue treatment with vinorelbine at 15 mg/m2 IV was elected.

A colo-colonic intussusception was diagnosed via abdominal imaging. Surgery was elected to reduce the intussusception, wherein a colonic mass was discovered. Colonic resection and anastomosis was performed, and the tissue were submitted for histopathological examination. The puppy was diagnosed with colonic hamartomatous ganglioneuromatosis based on the presence of markedly hyperplastic submucosal and myenteric plexi with infiltration and expansion of the mucosa and submucosa by Schwann cells and neuronal cell bodies. Ganglioneuromatosis is a rarely reported entity in the veterinary literature, and limited clinical follow up data is available for described cases. In humans, ganglioneuromatosis is associated with a PTEN genetic mutation, which confers increased susceptibility to the development of neoplasia of endocrine organs. Approximately 1 yr after the operation, this puppy appeared clinically normal with no abnormalities on repeated imaging. This case report describes the clinical presentation, surgical treatment, and histologic features of colonic hamartomatous ganglioneuromatosis with 1 yr postoperative clinical follow up data in a dog. Although uncommon, ganglioneuromatosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis list as a cause of gastrointestinal masses in puppies and young dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Humans</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Male</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Intussusception</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Colon</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Anastomosis, Surgical</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diagnosis, Differential</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>37708476</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Association between Hyperglycemia and Canine Serum Pancreatic Lipase Immunoreactivity Concentration in Diabetic Dogs.</Title>	<Abstract>It has been reported that hypertriglyceridemia can partially mediate between diabetes mellitus (DM) and pancreatitis in dogs, implying that another mediator, such as chronic hyperglycemia, might exist. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between hyperglycemia and serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) concentration in diabetic dogs. This retrospective cohort study included 26 client-owned diabetic dogs, divided according to their serum fructosamine levels (&lt;500 &#956;mol/L = well-controlled DM group; &#8805;500 &#956;mol/L = untreated or poorly controlled DM group). Five of the 26 DM dogs (19.2%) had serum cPLI concentrations consistent with pancreatitis, among which two showed ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis without clinical signs. The serum cPLI concentrations (median [interquartile range]) were significantly higher in the untreated or poorly controlled group (520 &#956;g/L [179.76-1000 &#956;g/L]) than in the well-controlled group (77 &#956;g/L [32.22-244.6 &#956;g/L], P = 0.0147). The serum fructosamine concentration was positively correlated with the serum cPLI concentration (r = 0.4816; P = 0.0127). Multivariate analysis revealed serum triglyceride and fructosamine concentrations were associated with the serum cPLI concentration. In conclusion, this study suggests that chronic hyperglycemia may induce pancreatic inflammation in diabetic dogs; however, the clinical significance of increased cPLI concentration is unknown.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList>	<MeshTerm>Dogs</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Animals</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Fructosamine</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Retrospective Studies</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Dog Diseases</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Diabetes Mellitus</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Hyperglycemia</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Lipase</MeshTerm><MeshTerm>Pancreatitis</MeshTerm></MeshTermList></Rec>

Stifle radiographs and fine needle aspirates of the soft tissue mass performed by the referring veterinarian confirmed the presence of predominantly highly granulated mast cells, consistent with a mast cell tumor. Computed tomography demonstrated a soft tissue mass centered on the left medial stifle, with associated joint effusion and polyostotic lytic lesions on the tibial plateau and distal patella. Ultrasound-guided aspirates of the liver, spleen, and popliteal lymph nodes were obtained to rule out further metastatic spread. Cytology of the joint fluid demonstrated a low number of well-differentiated mast cells. Surgical and oncological interventions were discussed, and full hind-limb amputation was elected. Histopathological analysis of the submitted tissues after amputation diagnosed a subcutaneous mast cell tumor with neoplastic cell infiltrate extending into sections of joint capsule and synovial membrane. Infiltration to the tibia and distal patella were suspected following the presence of mast cell clusters in both osteolytic lesions. No evidence of metastasis was identified in the popliteal lymph node.

The cat had vomited suspected lily plant material before presentation, and a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed to continue to administer activated charcoal. The NGT was passed with sedation and limited restraint. To confirm placement, a single lateral radiograph was taken, which showed that the tube was in the trachea, bronchus, through the pulmonary parenchyma, and extending into the region of the craniodorsal retroperitoneal space. The tube was subsequently removed, resulting in a tension pneumothorax. Bilateral thoracostomy tubes were placed and attached to continuous suction. The pneumothorax resolved after 2 days, the thoracostomy tubes were removed, and the cat was discharged on day 3 after admission. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first described pneumothorax complication with successful medical management secondary to routine nasogastric tube placement in a cat.

Management of the allergic patient entails a multimodal approach with frequent and ongoing communication with the client. Obtaining a comprehensive history is crucial for diagnosis and treatment of allergic skin diseases, and the guidelines describe key questions to ask when presented with allergic canine and feline patients. Once a detailed history is obtained, a physical examination should be performed, a minimum dermatologic database collected, and treatment for secondary infection, ectoparasites, and pruritus (where indicated) initiated.

Point-of-care blood work showed hypoglycemia and abdominal ultrasonography revealed a liver mass arising from the caudate liver lobe. The dog underwent a partial liver lobectomy, and histopathology confirmed a fully resected hepatocellular carcinoma. Blood glucose levels normalized initially after surgery, but 1 wk later, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on the development of polyuria, polydipsia, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Appropriate treatment with insulin was initiated, and 1 yr following the diagnosis, the dog was still requiring administration of insulin twice daily. This case describes the uncommon development of diabetes mellitus in a dog following surgical resection of a hepatocellular carcinoma initially associated with hypoglycemia. Although very unusual, this should be considered as a potential complication of surgical treatment of such tumors, and affected patients may require long-term medical management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physical examination confirmed medial patellar luxations and a mass effect of the left stifle medially. Radiographs showed medial distension of the joint capsule by a soft tissue opacity. Fine-needle aspirate of the left stifle revealed a mesenchymal cell population. Left medial parapatellar stifle arthrotomy found a fatty mass, which was excised at its base. A benign fibrolipoma was diagnosed on histopathology, and the excision was expected to be curative. The owners reported immediate improvement of perceived comfort postoperatively. At 2 and 24 wk, the dog returned to a normal level of function.

To control the uveitis without systemic side effects, oral cyclosporine was started after discontinuing oral steroid, but discontinued one month later because of severe vomiting. Leflunomide (2 mg/kg q 12 hr) was initiated, and the uveitis symptoms resolved after 2 mo. The dose was tapered according to the remission of clinical signs, with no relapse during the following 13 mo. Leflunomide therapy was then discontinued due to vomiting caused by severe gastroenteritis and pancreatitis, and topical prednisolone monotherapy was continued . At 8 mo after discontinuation of leflunomide, bilateral uveitis recurred, and leflunomide therapy was resumed. However, the patient lost vision due to the progression of clinical signs at 33 mo after commencing leflunomide, and evisceration of the glaucomatous right eye was performed at 43 mo. Histopathologic examination revealed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration and melanin-laden macrophages in the uveal tissue, and the patient was diagnosed with immune-mediated uveitis. This case indicated that oral leflunomide may be a viable treatment option for canine idiopathic immune-mediated uveitis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38175979</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Epistaxis and Facial Swelling Due to Nasal Blastomycosis in a Cat.</Title>	<Abstract>A 5 yr old castrated male domestic longhair was examined because of left-sided facial swelling and epistaxis. Head computed tomography with contrast identified a mass within the left nasal cavity and multifocal regions of nasal bone osteolysis. Histopathology of nasal mass biopsies and cytology of the facial swelling revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation due to Blastomyces dermatitidis. The cat experienced resolution of clinical signs following 8 mo of treatment with itraconazole. Although rare, clinicians should include blastomycosis on the differential diagnoses list of infectious causes for feline nasal disease if within an endemic area.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38175980</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Successful Surgical Resection of an Ependymal Cyst in the Fourth Ventricle of a Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>Ependymal cysts represent congenital brain malformations rarely described in human medicine, where surgical resection is the treatment of choice. In veterinary medicine, only three cases have been previously reported, with one partially resected with surgery. A 6 yr old entire male American Staffordshire terrier was referred with a 4 mo history of incoordination and collapsing episodes with extensor rigidity. Neurological examination localized the lesion to the left central vestibular system and cerebellum. A brain computed tomography scan showed a hypoattenuating lesion with peripheral contrast enhancement in the fourth ventricle consistent with a cyst and secondary hydrocephalus. Treatment with prednisone was initiated, but despite an initial improvement, neurologic signs recurred and a suboccipital craniectomy to remove the cyst was performed. The cyst was first drained, and the capsule was carefully resected. The histopathological evaluation revealed a simple cubic to cylindrical epithelium with apical cilia and loose surrounding fibrillar tissue consistent with an intraventricular ependymal cyst. Four and a half years after surgery, the dog only shows short episodes of balance loss when turning abruptly but is otherwise neurologically normal. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported ependymal cyst in the fourth ventricle of a dog with successful surgical resection.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38175981</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Septic Peritonitis Secondary to Neoplasia in Two Canine Cancer-Bearing Patients Lacking Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Organ Rupture.</Title>	<Abstract>In this case report, we describe the presentation, diagnosis, and outcome of septic peritonitis secondary to neoplasia in patients lacking evidence of gastrointestinal content leakage, liver abscessation, or other treatment-associated risk factors. Two dogs presented with a diagnosis of neoplasia and nonspecific clinical signs such as lethargy, hyporexia, vomiting, and discomfort that was localized to the abdomen. The diagnoses at presentation consisted of a perianal tumor consistent with apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma and systemic mastocytosis. Neither of the dogs was considered systemically immunocompromised or had received recent cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment or surgical procedures. A common finding on blood work in the two dogs was the presence of band neutrophils. The diagnosis of septic peritonitis via fluid analysis and cytology was delayed in both cases. No treatment for the supposed underlying cause of septic peritonitis was pursued and euthanasia was pursued in both cases owing to poor prognosis. On necropsy, one dog was suspected to have developed septic peritonitis because of an abscessed lymph node, and in the other case, no definitive source was identified. Septic peritonitis can arise secondary to neoplasia that is not primarily involving the liver or gastrointestinal tract in canine patients that lack treatment-associated risk factors.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38175982</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Retrospective Evaluation of Melphalan, Vincristine, and Cytarabine Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Relapsed Canine Lymphoma.</Title>	<Abstract>Dogs diagnosed with multicentric lymphoma often relapse following induction therapy within the first year of treatment. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of a novel drug combination using melphalan, vincristine, and cytarabine (MOC) for the treatment of relapsed lymphoma. On day 1, dogs were treated with vincristine (0.5-0.6 mg/m2 IV) and cytarabine (300 mg/m2 IV over 4-6 hr or subcutaneously over 2 days). On day 7, dogs were treated with melphalan (20 mg/m2per os). This 2 wk protocol was repeated for at least three cycles or until treatment failure. Twenty-six dogs were treated with MOC and met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three dogs had toxicity data, and all experienced adverse events with the majority graded as mild. The overall response rate was 38%, which included 19% of dogs who achieved a complete response. The median progression-free survival was 29 days (range 1-280 days). The overall clinical benefit was 65% for a median of 37 days (range 33-280 days). MOC is a safe treatment option for relapsed lymphoma in dogs.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>38175983</PMID>	<Type>Journal Article</Type>	<Title>Comparison of Aerobic Bacterial Culture Among Four Veterinary Microbiology Laboratories from Dogs with Superficial Pyoderma.</Title>	<Abstract>Bacterial culture and susceptibility are widely used in veterinary medicine to determine the specific bacteria causing infection as well as aid in appropriate antimicrobial selection. Previous studies have shown variable results with culture and susceptibility depending on the laboratory and methodology used. Samples from dogs with superficial pyoderma were obtained to make a homogeneous solution of bacteria. Sample acquisition from this solution was randomized and submitted to four veterinary laboratories for microbial identification and sensitivity. There was fair agreement among the laboratories in identification of a Staphylococcus spp. as well as fair agreement among the laboratories on the same Staphylococcus sp. Very good agreement was noted on identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. Additionally, good to very good agreement was noted on all antimicrobials that were tested across all four laboratories. A difference in turnaround time for sample processing was observed between the laboratories in the present study. Overall, there was mild variability among the laboratory results in this study.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
