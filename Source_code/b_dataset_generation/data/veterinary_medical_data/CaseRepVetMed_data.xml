<Rec><Common><PMID>29955414</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Cutaneous Disease as Sole Clinical Manifestation of Protothecosis in a Boxer Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>Prototheca wickerhamii is ubiquitous, saprophytic achlorophyllous algae that cause opportunistic infections in the dog and cat and disseminated disease usually in immunocompromised animals. In this report an uncommon case of canine cutaneous protothecosis is presented. A 6-year-old female boxer was brought in with skin lesions that consisted of nodules and generalized footpad hyperkeratosis, depigmentation, and erosion. Cytology and histopathology showed pyogranulomatous inflammation along with organisms containing round sporangia with spherical sporangiospores. PCR and sequencing identified the causal organism as Prototheca wickerhamii. Therapy applied in this patient with either fluconazole alone or combination of amphotericin B and itraconazole proved effective only for footpad lesions but not for skin nodules. Systemic therapy seems to be ineffective for skin nodules, at least in chronic cases of canine cutaneous protothecosis. Although canine protothecosis usually presents with the disseminated form, cutaneous disease as sole clinical manifestation of the infection may also be witnessed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Some weeks after complete healing of the original wounds, the monkey developed a chronic pressure sore on plantar surface of the heel of its right foot. A loss of sensitivity in the sole of the foot was hypothesized. The skin defect was closed by a medial sensate pedicled instep flap followed by counter transplantation of a full thickness graft from the interdigital webspace. The integrity of the tibial nerve was revised and reconstructed by means of the turnover flap technique. Both procedures were successful. This is an uncommon case in an exotic veterinary patient as it demonstrates a reconstructive skin flap procedure for the treatment of a chronic, denervated wound in combination with the successful reconstruction of 2.5 cm gap in the tibial nerve.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Complete bloodwork, thoracic radiographs, and endoscopic examination of the nasal passages and distal trachea revealed no significant findings. Echocardiogram and contrast study revealed a single artery overriding a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). A small atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale was also noted. Color flow Doppler and an agitated saline contrast study revealed bidirectional but primarily right to left flow through the VSD and bidirectional shunting through the atrial defect. Differential diagnosis based on echocardiographic findings included common arterial trunk, Tetralogy of Fallot, and pulmonary atresia with a VSD. Postmortem examination revealed a large common arterial trunk with a quadricuspid valve overriding a VSD. Additionally, defect in the atrial septum was determined to be a patent foramen ovale. A single pulmonary trunk arose from the common arterial trunk and bifurcated to the left and right pulmonary artery, consistent with a Collet and Edwards' type I common arterial trunk with aortic predominance. Although uncommon, congenital cardiac defects should be considered in animals presenting with clinical signs of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or failure to thrive.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

(Diptera: Oestridae) Induced Nasal Myiasis in a Dog from Northern Italy.</Title>	<Abstract>A companion dog from Milan province (northern Italy), presenting with frequent and violent sneezing, underwent rhinoscopy, laryngoscopy, and tracheoscopy procedures. During rhinoscopy, a dipteran larva was isolated from the dog and identified as first instar larval stage of O. ovis by morphological features. Reports of O. ovis in domestic carnivores are sporadic and nevertheless this infestion should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis of rhinitis in domestic carnivores living in contaminated areas by the fly as consequence of the presence of sheep and goats. This report described a case of autochthonous infestion in a dog from an area where O. ovis was not historically present but it could be affected by a possible expansion of the fly as a consequence of climate change. This is the first record of Oestrus ovis infestion in a dog in Italy and, at the same time, the most northerly finding of larvae of sheep bot fly in the country.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

One of them presented a history of chronic liquid diarrhea and of several unsuccessful treatments. In both cats, G. duodenalis and trichomonads were detected in fecal smears from freshly voided feces; the presence of T. foetus was confirmed by a real-time PCR assay. The cats completely recovered after treatment with ronidazole. In a refrigerated fecal sample collected from the cat with chronic diarrhea, drop-shaped trichomonad pseudocysts smaller than G. duodenalis cysts were detected. They appeared brownish or light-bluish when stained with Lugol's solution or with Giemsa stain, respectively, and their morphological features were similar to those expressed by bovine T. foetus pseudocysts in vitro. Existence of pseudocysts even in feline trichomonads is noteworthy as they could represent a form of protozoan resistance due to unfavorable conditions whose detection in refrigerated feces can be a useful clue for clinicians.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 45-day-old male kid was presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sudan University of Science and Technology (SUST), with a history of an increasing prescrotal swelling. At presentation in the clinic the kid was bright and alert and the vital parameters were within the normal physiological range. Ultrasonography was performed to assess the integrity of the urinary system using (3.5-5) MHz curvilinear probe and it revealed normal kidneys and a distended urinary bladder. The kid was referred to surgery and two hypospadiac urinary fistulae were found. One fistula was sutured and the other was not corrected due to catheterization failure.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

En bloc extensive resection of the penis and prepuce, without penile retroversion or pexy to ventral abdomen associated with a permanent perineal urethrostomy, was performed. Histology of the mass revealed a squamous cell carcinoma of penis and prepuce. The surgical technique that was adopted is a modified version of that already described that allows a more proximal resection of the penile body and is a valid option for treating advanced SCC lesions involving the penis. Early postsurgical complications (mild strangury, haemorrhage from the urethrostomy site and its partial dehiscence, and infection of the abdominal wound) were managed with a medical treatment and resolved within 5 to 12 days. Three years after surgery the horse is in good body condition and does not show any sign of recurrence or disorders related to the surgery.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A perineal hernia was ruled out on digital rectal examination, and blood work was unremarkable. An extremely dilated vagina was identified on computed tomography, and hydrocolpos was suspected. Endoscopic vaginal exam confirmed the diagnosis of imperforate hymen. The membrane was ruptured digitally and remnants were removed endoscopically, resulting in resolution of clinical signs. Imperforate hymen is a rare congenital abnormality that can result in extensive fluid accumulation within the vagina and subsequent compression of local structures or secondary infection.

Soon after induction of general anesthesia, tracheal intubation, and isoflurane administration, hiccup-like movements were evident. These hiccup-like movements did not respond to hyperventilation and increase of anesthetic. After having ruled out pulmonary disease, the animal was reanesthetized with a similar technique; hiccup-like movements reoccurred and did not stop after discontinuation of isoflurane and commencement of a propofol infusion. Eventually, a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent was administered to stop the hiccup-like response and allow MRI to be performed. This case report describes the pathophysiology of hiccup-like response and its management in a dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This is even very important in countries where there is little public health awareness about the disease; thus confined animals in the zoo can be infected directly or indirectly by infected humans and vice versa. In Nigeria, the problem of TB is a major concern among both humans and cattle. Here, we present cases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. tuberculosis/M. bovis infections in a female gorilla and a lioness, respectively, in a zoo in Ibadan, Nigeria. These cases were confirmed after bacteriological examinations and DNA from granulomatous lesions of the animals' carcasses were subjected to the Hain and spoligotyping techniques. Our findings reveal the first documented report of TB infections in a gorilla and a lioness in zoo animals in Nigeria. The public health risks of tuberculosis in zoological settings are therefore reemphasized.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The most relevant clinical findings were bone demineralization, high level of parathyroid hormone (PTH), normophosphatemia, normal ionized calcium, and low total thyroxine (tT4) with a normal renal function. Long-term treatment was based on teeth coronal reduction and maintaining a balanced diet. PTH measurement was performed with a kit suitable for rats to test 4 different paired samples of guinea pigs and resulted in similar results for each pair of measurements. Two kits routinely employed in dogs and cats failed in measuring PTH in guinea pig serum samples. The ionized calcium, PTH, and tT4 values, not previously reported in similar cases, were obtained. The determination of tT4 could be useful in the diagnosis of fibrous osteodystrophy in guinea pigs. The observed findings show similarity with human pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia, a disease caused by an inactivating heterozygous mutation of the stimulatory G protein &#945; subunit from the maternal genome that induces multiple hormone resistance and that courses with a syndrome called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Naturally occurring pseudohypoparathyroidism in animals has been reported previously only in a ferret.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On physical examination, a soft midbody intracoelomic swelling was palpated. Transcutaneous coelomic ultrasound revealed a target-like mass on a transverse section of the stomach, suggesting the presence of a gastrointestinal intussusception. On exploratory coeliotomy, a double compounded esophagogastric and gastroduodenal intussusception was diagnosed and reduced surgically. A gastropexy was also performed to prevent recurrence. On histopathology, the gastric glandular mucosa showed moderate to marked proliferation. Diffusely lining the luminal surface of glandular epithelium and free within the lumen were a myriad of protozoa consistent with Cryptosporidium sp. A diagnosis of chronic proliferative gastritis due to Cryptosporidium sp. was made based on these findings. Intussusceptions are rare in reptiles and are infrequently reported in snakes. This is the first report of a double compounded intussusception in a nonmammalian species and the first report of an intussusception involving the stomach in a snake with gastritis due to Cryptosporidium sp.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>29955429</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Autoinflammatory Reaction in Dogs Treated for Cancer via G6PD Inhibition.</Title>	<Abstract>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in cancer cells to provide the NADPH required for their increased anabolism. NADPH, sourced from G6PD fuels nucleotide biosynthesis, maintains redox potential of thioredoxin and glutathione and drives the mevalonate pathway that powers many of the basic mechanisms by which cancer cells escape host control. G6PD is thus a target for cancer treatment being addressed by many groups around the world. We have discovered that systemic inhibition of G6PD by high dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) causes a severe autoinflammatory response in dogs, which does not occur in mice or rats. Since dogs more closely model the human adrenal androgen system than do common laboratory animals, this finding is relevant to the design of G6PD-inhibiting drugs for humans. The autoinflammatory reaction observed closely resembles mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), a rare autosomal recessive disease in humans characterized by recurrent febrile attacks, arthralgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers of mucocutaneous tissues. In a manner comparable to animal models of MKD, the reconstitution of protein geranylgeranylation blocked the autoinflammatory reaction caused by systemic G6PD inhibition. This autoinflammatory response to systemic G6PD inhibition represents an unexpected result that must be taken into consideration when targeting this oncoprotein.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The pathogenesis of this disease is still obscure, and Sampson's theory of retrograde menstruation is still the most widely accepted explanation. Endometriosis in animals has been so far described not only in baboons and a rhesus macaque but also in dogs and horses that are nonmenstruating animals. In this article, we report the histological and immunohistochemical characterization of the first case of ovarian cystic endometriosis and adenomyosis in a guinea pig. The case presented supports the hypothesis that endometriosis is a disease not at all related to the phenomenon of retrograde menstruation but is a consequence of some alterations in the morphogenesis of the female genital system and therefore it could be found in any mammal. We suggest considering endometriosis among the other pathological phenotypes in animals displaying ovarian and uterine alterations and having a history of difficulties in conceiving.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After failing to improve with conservative management and pain medication, surgical stabilization of the joint was performed using a novel application of a braided suture and titanium button system. Unsatisfactory clinical improvement and postsurgical reevaluation indicated that the initial surgical stabilization was unsuccessful. The surgery was repeated, and the animal showed postsurgical improvement in intertarsal joint stability, weight-bearing, and lameness for a period of several years with use and adjustment of chronic pain medications. The novel surgical technique described in this case report represents an additional treatment option for management of avian intertarsal joint subluxations. Presurgical planning should consider the unique anatomic features and variability of the avian tarsometatarsus to avoid surgical complications.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The MIRIS facilitated efficient MIPO in all three fractures. Radial and tibial lengths were restored within 2% of the length of the intact bone and postoperative frontal and sagittal plane angulation were within 3&#176; of the normal contralateral limb for each of the fractures. Fixation failed in one of the tibial fractures when the plates bent a week following surgery. The implants were removed and the fracture was restabilized via MIPO facilitated by the MIRIS. Inappropriate implant selection was considered the primary reason for implant failure. All three fractures achieved union by 10 weeks following surgery. The dog that underwent revision surgery developed a surgical site infection 5 months following revision surgery, which necessitated implant removal. All three dogs had excellent limb function at the time of the final evaluation. This system resulted in reductions that were near anatomic, with acceptable restoration of length and alignment and excellent limb function.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Pathologic findings in both the spleen and globe were consistent with hemangiosarcoma with a low mitotic count. Initial treatment consisted of enucleation and then splenectomy followed by one cycle of conventional doxorubicin chemotherapy. Due to poor tolerance, a subsequent treatment regimen consisted of metronomic chemotherapy with chlorambucil combined with an alternative/complementary regimen of I'm-Yunity (polysaccharopeptide) and Yunnan Baiyao. Follow-up thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasounds over a period of 24 months showed no evidence of pulmonary, hepatic, or right atrial metastases, during which time the patient had an excellent quality of life. However, shortly after achieving two-year survival, the patient developed new onset seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. Therefore, a decision was made to euthanize the dog given that the most likely etiology of the seizures was a brain tumor. Overall, this is an exceptional treatment response given the poor survival statistics of hemangiosarcoma even with conventional chemotherapy. However, additional clinical pharmacology and clinical trial data are needed to further support the use of a complementary/holistic approach in combination with metronomic chemotherapy.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

An approximately 4-year-old female Staffordshire Bull Terrier presented with a large mass on the front of lower jaw which was diagnosed as oral papillary squamous cell carcinoma by histopathology. CT scans revealed invasion of the cancer to the frenulum of the tongue. The mass was inoperable due to location, expansiveness, and metastatic lymph nodes. The dog received 4 treatments of intralesional hyaluronan-platinum conjugates (HylaPlat&#8482;, HylaPharm LLC, Lawrence, Kansas) at 3-week intervals. Clinical chemistry and complete blood count were performed one week after each treatment and results were within normal limits. Complications included bleeding due to tumor tissue sloughing, as well as a single seizure due to unknown causes. Upon completion of chemotherapy, CT showed that the mass had regressed and was no longer invading the lingual frenulum, and multiple lymph nodes were free of metastasis. The mass thus became resectable and the dog successfully underwent rostral bilateral mandibulectomy. Over one year after chemotherapy and surgery, the cancer remains in complete remission.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Anaesthesia was induced with intramuscular etorphine and azaperone delivered remotely by dart, followed by an intravenous bolus of ketamine. The trachea was intubated, and anaesthesia was maintained with an etorphine-ketamine constant rate infusion (CRI). The rhinoceros did not respond predictably to induction of anaesthesia and developed life-threatening systemic hypotension throughout the 90-minute procedure. A mega-vertebrate demand ventilator was successfully used to provide intermittent positive pressure ventilation when the rhinoceros developed apnoea. This case report describes the maintenance of anaesthesia of a white rhinoceros using an etorphine-ketamine CRI and the causes and management of hypotension and respiratory impairment observed in this patient.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The dog developed severe hypernatremia within six hours of presentation, which responded poorly to the administration of five percent dextrose in water. As central diabetes insipidus was suspected, desmopressin was trialled and resolution of hypernatremia was achieved six days later. Transient trauma-induced central diabetes insipidus has been described previously in two dogs; in the first, serum sodium concentrations were evaluated three days after injury and the other developed hypernatremia seven days after injury. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of rapid onset, transient, and trauma-induced central diabetes insipidus in a dog that encompasses the complete clinical progression of the syndrome from shortly after injury through to resolution.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On clinical examination the dog displayed vasoconstrictive circulatory shock, dehydration, and melena. Laboratory tests revealed a marked hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and a decreased sodium/potassium ratio of &#8804; 12.4. The baseline and poststimulation serum cortisol concentrations were markedly elevated following adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, yielding 712 nmol/L and 706 nmol/L, respectively. The elevated cortisol concentration excluded hypoadrenocorticism. A concurrent Trichuris vulpis (whipworm) infection was also identified. The dog was treated with supportive care including fenbendazole and recovered uneventfully. The final diagnosis was Trichuris vulpis infection with secondary pseudohypoadrenocorticism. This case report further supports a previous observation that the Siberian Husky breed may have an increased sensitivity to infection with Trichuris vulpis and development of pseudohypoadrenocorticism.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Esophagostomy tubes (E-tubes) are commonly used in dogs and cats for enteral support, but data are lacking regarding colonizing fungi and the impact of colonization on tube integrity. In this study, esophagostomy tubes were collected in lieu of disposal from dogs and cats undergoing feeding tube exchange. Fungi were isolated with culture and identified using morphological characteristics. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the surface characteristics of the tubes. Two silicone and one polyurethane E-tube were evaluated. Fungi associated with the normal microbiota, including Candida sp. and Penicillium sp., as well as environmental fungi were identified. This case series represents the first documentation of fungal colonization of silicone and polyurethane E-tubes in dogs and cats. Additionally, this is the first report to document degenerative changes in a silicone E-tube.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

On initial examination, a weight loss of 234 kg, a mature cataract in the right eye, and a focal cataract in the left eye were diagnosed. Ultrasound and electroretinography (ERG) indicated normal retinal attachment and both eyes were viable candidates for surgery. After careful planning and behavioral training, the left cataract was surgically removed via phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration. The right eye subsequently developed a ventral lens subluxation, and phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration were performed six months after the first procedure. Four years after surgery, menace response, palpebral reflex, dazzle reflex, and pupillary light reflexes were present in both eyes. Body weight was 5,515 kg, 88kg more than at the time of the second surgery. This is the first published report of an African bull elephant undergoing bilateral cataract removal using phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration. The lack of significant postoperative inflammation and uneventful recovery of the elephant suggests that this surgical procedure along with proper preoperative planning and postoperative medical management can be a safe and effective treatment option for elephants with cataracts.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

She was recommended for permanent sterilization due to her history of conception while on oral contraceptives. She underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. Due to the similar anatomy to humans, human OB/GYN surgical consultants were used. The objective of this case report is to describe a modern technique for approaching and employing laparoscopic surgery in primates. Minimally invasive surgery allows for faster recovery and fewer complications, and has become the preferred approach for surgical intervention in many animals. The information presented in this case report can be expanded to benefit not only Chimpanzees but other large primate species as well. However, subtle anatomical differences among species must be recognized in order to be carried out safely.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Fourteen pigs died out of a herd of 59 animals over a period of 16 days between the first and sixteenth of March 2018. The clinical signs observed included sternal recumbency, fever, weakness, pain and reluctance to move, hyperemia of the skin and anorexia, followed by death. Necropsy findings included large amounts of unclotted blood in the pleural and peritoneal cavities, diffuse carcass congestion, splenomegaly, consolidation of both lungs, hemorrhagic and frothy airways and trachea, hepatomegaly and congestion, congestion of the gastric mucosa, enlarged and congested kidneys, ecchymotic epicardial, and endocardial hemorrhages, and very enlarged and congested urinary bladder. All the remaining pigs were euthanized, burned, and buried under state veterinary supervision. The authors concluded that the outbreak resulted from indirect transmission of the ASF virus due to lapses in biosecurity measures.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clostridium perfringens type A was identified via fecal culture and toxin genotyping. Hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) was diagnosed based on microbiological results along with abdominal ultrasonography, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry. Aggressive multi-modal therapy was employed including intravenously administered fluid therapy, potassium penicillin, lidocaine, flunixin, and pantoprazole among other supportive care. The bull was discharged after 15 days of hospitalization and recovered uneventfully to full function by the next breeding season. Currently all case reports with regard to HBS in beef cattle describe mortality. While the dairy cattle literature demonstrates that HBS has a high mortality rate, and suggests that surgical intervention has a higher prognosis when compared to medical therapy in dairy cattle. Our case would provide support to aggressive medical treatment for HBS in beef cattle.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The diaphyseal fractures were successfully stabilized with bone plate fixation. Premature closure of the caudal aspect of the proximal tibial physis, secondary to the proximal physeal fracture, resulted in an excessively high tibial plateau angle (TPA) of 50&#176; with a limb length discrepancy of 13% by 24 weeks of age. The deformity was addressed by performing a proximal tibial osteotomy and subsequent distraction osteogenesis to reduce the TPA while concurrently lengthening the crus. A radial osteotomy was performed in the proximal metaphyseal region and the hinged fixator was applied. Distraction was initiated the day following surgery at a rate of 1 mm per day as measured along the caudal cortex of the tibia with a rhythm of three distractions daily. Distraction was terminated 19 days postoperatively. Sequential distraction of the osteotomy resulted in 17 mm of tibial lengthening and a final TPA of 3&#176;. The fixator was removed 52 days after application. Complications included wire tract inflammation involving the wires securing the proximal segment and a calcaneal fracture which required bone plate stabilization. The left pelvic limb was only 8% shorter than the right pelvic limb and the dog had only a subtle lameness 12 months after surgery. The hinged circular fixator construct allowed for both the reduction of the TPA and limb segment lengthening in this dog.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Physical examination revealed a loud left parasternal systolic murmur with no thrill. An echocardiogram showed a large hyperechoic vegetation (about 9 mm thick) on the aortic valve leaflets. The results of Doppler ultrasound examination were compatible with severe aortic stenosis. A singular urine culture test performed by cystocentesis samples enabled the isolation of more than 10[5] CFU/ml in a pure culture of Salmonella typhimurium. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and moderate dilatation of small bowel loops were found on abdominal ultrasound examination. The patient was treated with marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg IM every 24 hours), cefazoline (20 mg/kg SC every 12 hours), metronidazole (10 mg/Kg IV every 12 hours), clopidogrel (18.75 mg PO every 24 hours), atenolol (0.5 mg/kg OS every 12 hours), and fluid therapy (ringer acetate 2.5 ml/kg/h), but after three days in hospital the patient died from presumed septic shock. A urine culture revealed that Salmonella typhimurium was sensitive to third generation cephalosporins but not to fluoroquinolones. Necropsy, histologic examinations, culture of the aortic valve, and PCR analysis of the aortic valve leaflets were eventually performed and Salmonella typhimurium endocarditis with myocardial phlegmon was confirmed. Endocarditis is a rare disease in cats and poorly described in the veterinary literature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of Salmonella typhimurium endocarditis and myocarditis in a cat.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The affected limb was rotated externally and adducted with a prominent greater trochanter and the right calcaneal tuber being more proximal than its left counterpart. Radiographic examination revealed complete dislocation of the right femoral head from the acetabular cavity in a dorsal and caudal direction. A closed reduction of the coxofemoral luxation was performed successfully under general anaesthesia. A full-body animal rescue and transportation sling (ARTS) was applied for the recovery. The reduction was followed by a right-sided medial patellar desmotomy. The pony was supported in the ARTS for a total of eight weeks combined with crossties for the first six weeks. Subsequently, the mare was discharged with instructions to slowly increase walking exercise over a period of two months before returning to her intended use. A follow-up after 22 months attested the successful treatment of a coxofemoral luxation by closed reduction and prolonged immobilization resulting in a regularly exercised pony without any residual lameness.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Neither animal was linebred within 5 generations. This cow-calf pair represented the first reported occurrence of polydactyly in Dexter cattle in the US or abroad. Based upon external examination, the cow was classified as having a spontaneous unilateral case of polydactyly with an extra digit along the medial digit of the right front limb and the heifer was classified as having bilateral polydactyly because both front limbs exhibited an extra digit along the medial digit. Radiographic examination confirmed bilateral status of the heifer and revealed bilateral status of the cow. The front feet of the cow and heifer had extra bone formation consistent with an extra digit along the medial digit. Neither animal suffered from limited mobility to date or required hoof treatments. The cow produced a second calf from a different sire, a bull calf that did not appear polydactylous per external examination and was not examined radiographically. The two polydactylous animals will remain in the breeding herd to produce more study calves unless their fitness becomes compromised.

Vaginal and rectal examinations revealed an approximately 360&#176; counterclockwise uterine torsion. The torsion was corrected by rolling the cow counterclockwise (three episodes) with the aid of a plank coupled with manual detorsion via the vagina. The placement of obstetric chains followed by manual traction ultimately delivered a stillborn male calf with evidence of vertebral aplasia, arthrogryposis, and abdominal organ herniation. Patient history and subsequent parentage verification revealed that the calf was the result of a consanguineous (mother to son) mating. Tissue samples from the affected calf and blood samples from the dam, sire, and ten half siblings were collected for genetic testing and parentage verification.

<Rec><Common><PMID>32280554</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Hirudiniasis in Cattle in Mpwapwa District, Dodoma Region of Tanzania.</Title>	<Abstract>Hirudiniasis is a condition caused by infestation by leeches. Despite the annoyance, clinical signs, and associated lesions caused by leeches in both humans and animals, the extent of the problem in Tanzania is not well elucidated. Individual animals and people become infested when they drink, bath, or walk through contaminated water sources. Leech infestations are more common in rural areas where water is scarce especially during the dry season. In this report, clinical cases of hirudiniasis in twenty-seven (27) cattle in Mpwapwa, Tanzania, are presented. The report further reviews the morphological features of leeches and creates awareness among the affected cattle farmers and the general public. A total of two hundred (200) live cattle were examined; out of these, 27 cattle had live leeches. There were, on average, 3-8 leeches per animal. Affected cattle had wounds on the gums, buccal mucosa, root of the tongue, and under the tongue with copious amounts of blood-stained frothy discharge. Further, the affected animals had respiratory distress and were rolling their tongues. The leeches were manually removed from all the affected cattle, with uneventful recovery. Laboratory examination revealed segmented, dorsal-ventral flattened, cylindrical parasites which had posterior and anterior suckers. The leech infestation was linked to drinking water from a pond which was suspected to be contaminated with "undescribed organisms" as indicated by the farmers. A follow-up was made and revealed no new cases and complete recovery of the affected animals. Hirudiniasis is one of the neglected diseases in humans and livestock and, therefore, requires integrated efforts especially in areas where water is scarce during the dry season. It is anticipated that this case report will stimulate interest and more studies in the subject matter to understand the extent of the problem and document the species and distribution of leeches in Tanzania.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In this case report, the clinical, radiographic, ultrasonographic, endoscopic, surgical, and histopathologic findings of a single benign duodenal stricture in a Golden Retriever are reported. Definitive diagnosis was made possible with the utilization of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Surgical correction of the stricture, paired with dietary therapy that utilized a highly digestible diet, resolved the clinical signs in the case reported. Several inciting causes were identified as possible drivers of stricture formation, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration, mucosal ulceration, traumatic injury, or inflammatory intestinal disease. A benign duodenal stricture should be considered an infrequent cause of intermittent, chronic gastrointestinal signs that may have a favorable outcome via surgical correction and dietary management.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Initial ophthalmic examination revealed moderate ocular hypertension, a diffusely and markedly shallow anterior chamber with anteriorly displaced iris and lens, vitreal prolapse, and a normal iridocorneal angle (ICA) morphology. The patient displayed a paradoxical response to topical latanoprost with an increase in intraocular pressure. These examination findings led to a putative diagnosis of spontaneous aqueous humor misdirection syndrome (AHMS). The patient was successfully managed with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and apraclonidine for eight months until progressive ulcerative keratitis necessitated enucleation of the affected globe. Histopathology and high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the enucleated globe did not identify an underlying cause for the glaucoma. This case suggests that AHMS should be considered in dogs presenting with a shallow anterior chamber, vitreal prolapse, increased intraocular pressure, and no other causes of glaucoma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Considering Salmonella sp. was cultured from the jejunal luminal contents and the large volume of nasogastric reflux that was evacuated in this case, a perceived risk of Salmonella sp. transmission from infected gastric reflux to other hospitalized cases was realized. Infectious agent biosecurity precautions should be undertaken in horses with nasogastric reflux to prevent hospital-acquired transmission.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>32566355</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Nasopharyngeal Vascular Hamartoma in a Dog.</Title>	<Abstract>An 8-year-old spayed female 32 kg Labrador retriever was presented for further investigation into the underlying cause of dyspnea, stertor, and sleep apnea present for three months and worsening over 30 days. There were significant reduction in airflow through the nares and loud inspiratory stridor. Thoracic and cervical radiographs made were normal. A skull CT and retrograde rhinoscopy showed a mass occluding the majority of the nasopharynx above the caudal third of the hard palate. The main differential diagnoses included a neoplastic mass vs. inflammatory mass vs. cyst vs. mucous obstruction. There was no destruction of nasal turbinates, making a benign etiology more likely. Biopsy of the mass showed an inflammatory process. En bloc excision of the mass was performed via ventral rhinotomy without complication. Histopathology of the excised mass revealed it to be a mucosal vascular hamartoma. The dog recovered uneventfully and had no further respiratory issues, short or long term. Although vascular hamartomas are a rare finding in veterinary medicine, they can be found in a wide variety of species and anatomic locations. They should be considered when naming differentials for benign mass lesions throughout the body, including the nasopharynx. Although they are benign masses in nature, they can be clinically significant and should be addressed. Prognosis after removal in this location is excellent.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Several zoos in Europe and some private ranches in the US (Texas) maintain this species in captivity as a hedge against extinction. A routine reproductive exam on an adult male revealed bilateral cysts in the testicular parenchyma. The fluid in the cysts contained copious, moderately progressive motile spermatozoa. Following examination, the gazelle was diagnosed with bilateral intratesticular spermatoceles. Electroejaculation yielded 1.5 ml of semen containing 387 &#215; 10[6] total sperm with 50% motility and 45% morphologically normal sperm. The spermatoceles did not appear to cause pain or dysfunction, so no treatment was performed at this time. Since fewer than 10 animals are managed in captivity in the US, no intervention (castration/hemicastration) was considered.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The mass was diagnosed as a sarcoma via punch biopsy with no evidence of metastasis on diagnostic imaging. Surgical margins of 1-2 cm were planned to achieve complete excision of the neoplasm. A technique for tissue expansion was employed due to concerns regarding the ability to close the surgical site without excess tension or dehiscence. Two 27 mm diameter &#215; 5 mm hygroscopic self-inflating tissue expanders were placed subcutaneously under the lateral scales adjacent to the mass. Maximum skin expansion occurred over a four-week period, and no direct negative effects were noted. Excision of the primary mass was performed routinely five weeks after implant placement. Primary closure of the defect was achieved with minimal tension by incorporating the expanded skin. While the surgery was successful with no evidence of metastasis, the snake died of sepsis two weeks postoperatively. This is the first report of the use of self-inflating hygroscopic tissue expanders to help close a surgical defect in a reptile.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

After exclusion of flea allergy dermatitis, ectoparasite infestation, retroviral infection, neoplasia, and cutaneous adverse food reaction, a diagnosis of nonflea, nonfood hypersensitivity dermatitis (NFNFHD) was made. The resolution of complicating bacterial infection and yeast overgrowth did not improve the animal's condition. Numerous antipruritic treatment modalities used during the investigation proved unsuccessful, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive prednisolone doses, oclacitinib, antihistamines, ciclosporin A, and supplementation with essential fatty acids. Allergen-specific serology test results were negative. Treatment with oral dexamethasone allowed a complete resolution of clinical signs. The cat has been successfully maintained in remission for over 12 months. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of a cat with multi-drug-resistant NFNFHD treated successfully with dexamethasone.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

If they occur, they are mostly seen in the right atrium while only two case reports describing a mural left atrial thrombus in dogs are available. This case report describes a 14-year-old mixed-breed bitch that was presented at the clinic because of dyspnoea. The dog suffered from alopecia for about three years and displayed polyuria and polydipsia for a number of months. Clinical examination revealed intensified inspiratory and expiratory respiratory sounds and various heart sounds. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly (VHS 11) and a mixed bronchoalveolar lung pattern of the caudal lung. A transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed a moderate mitral regurgitation, a highly dilated left atrium, a low-grade pulmonary insufficiency, and a minimal aortic and tricuspid insufficiency. Additionally, a free-floating ball thrombus was found in the left atrium. Hyperadrenocorticism was indicated by an ACTH stimulation test. The previous medical therapy of the referring veterinarian consisted of benazepril and furosemide and was complemented by clopidogrel. The pet owners declined any further clinical diagnostics and therapy. The dog died 19 days later. This is the first reported case of a dog with a free-floating left atrial thrombus. Specific therapeutic strategies for intracardiac thrombi in the dog are currently not available, and therefore, every patient should be treated individually.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The yak was noted to be healthy at presentation. Both ovaries were removed using a laparoscopic approach as follows: after induction and maintenance of general inhalant anesthesia, 15 degrees Trendelenburg positioning was required to view the ovaries. Ovariectomy was conducted within a surgical time of 50 minutes. Due to the small ovarian size, portal enlargement was not necessary for removal. Mild hemorrhage from the left ovarian pedicle was controlled with application of a vessel-sealing device. Postoperative complications were not encountered during hospitalization. At 12 months following surgery, the yak was healthy, and the owner was highly satisfied with the procedure. The described approach was successful for performing laparoscopic ovariectomy in a juvenile yak. Positioning for surgery was similar to other small ruminant species. Further case enrollment is needed to optimize the surgical approach and better describe clinical outcomes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Thoracic radiographs revealed an alveolar pattern in the right middle lung lobe and multifocal nodules in other lung lobes. A pulmonary mass was found on necropsy, which was composed of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components, confirmed with cytokeratin and vimentin immunohistochemistry. Using the World Health Organization classification scheme for mixed pulmonary tumors, this tumor would be characterized as a pleomorphic squamous cell carcinoma under the umbrella term of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma. The World Health Organization classification of mixed pulmonary tumors and its application to previously reported mixed pulmonary tumors in companion animals is discussed.

This report illustrates an uncommon state of congenital PKD in a girgentana goat (Capra falconeri). A stillborn female goat kid was submitted for postmortem examination and underwent macroscopic and microscopic examination. The kidneys showed a bilateral nephromegaly and a perpendicular polycystic altered texture of the renal parenchyma. Renal tissue sections were comprehensively investigated by histopathology (overview and special stains), immunohistochemistry (CD10, CD117, pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, E-cadherin, Pax2, Pax8, and vimentin), and electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). Histopathology of renal tissue sections revealed polycystic alterations of the renal parenchyma as well as conspicuous polypoid proliferates/projections of the renal tubular epithelium, which showed clear cell characteristics. Furthermore, epithelial projections were indicative for epithelio-mesenchymal-transition, cellular depolarization, and strong expression of differentiation markers Pax2, Pax8, and CD10. Ultrastructural morphology of the projections was characterized by numerous diffusely distributed, demarked round cytoplasmic structures and several apico-lateral differentiations. Additionally, hepatic malformations comprising biliary duct proliferation with saccular dilation and bridging fibrosis were observed. Notably, this report describes the first case of a congenital cystic nephropathy with overlapping features of heritable and acquired nephropathies in any species. Epithelio-mesenchymal-transition and altered cadherin expression seem to be crucial components of a suspected pathomechanism during cystogenesis.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 13-year-old crossbreed female dog was submitted to surgery to remove an inguinal mammary nodule. The tumour was composed of mammary epithelium and mesenchymal populations, not only of cartilage and bone but also of myoid cells. PTAH demonstrated cross striation of striated muscle, and immunohistochemistry highlighted striated muscle expressing desmin and calponin, and smooth muscle expressing desmin, SMA, and calponin. The tumour was diagnosed as a benign mixed tumour with leio- and rhabdomyoid differentiation. There was no tumour recurrence after one year of clinical follow-up. In conclusion, the well-differentiated features of leiomyocytes and rhabdomyocytes and the growth pattern define the benign origin of the mesenchymal component, which has been confirmed by a benign outcome; therefore, the knowledge of this kind of differentiation is helpful to avoid misdiagnoses.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although this lesion is likewise rare in veterinary medicine and there were sparse reports in several species such as dogs, cats, cows, and calves, we incidentally encountered ectopic hepatic tissue in a guinea pig. In the case of guinea pigs, we report for the first time the occurrence of ectopic hepatic tissue implanted in the gallbladder. The healthy guinea pig remained asymptomatic, and its macroscopic findings also showed no abnormalities. Hematological examinations exhibited moderate decreases in white cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations, and packed cell volume ratio. Serum biochemical examinations showed decreases in total protein and albumin and increases in glucose levels, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and &#947;-glutamyl transpeptidase. There were slight changes in electrolytes (Cl, Ca, and Mg) and inorganic phosphorus, indicating minor deviations from physiologic ranges. An increase in TBIL concentrations was not found in this examination. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of normal hepatic structures (hepatocytes and hepatic cords) within the wall of the normal gallbladder. The vascular and bile duct structures and portal triads were not observed in the ectopic hepatic tissue. In conclusion, this microectopic hepatic tissue in a guinea pig was characterized by the embedded structures of hepatic tissues, without foreign body reaction.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Until now, only one paper has contributed to the detailed understanding of canine ICAML. Reports have confirmed that 3-dimensional echocardiography (3-DE) is a simple and fast imaging technique that is useful for the diagnosis of ICAML and morphological evaluation of the mitral valve in humans. However, to our knowledge, no studies have provided details about the effectiveness of 3-DE in ICAML diagnosis in dogs. Thus, we aimed to determine the usefulness of a diagnostic technique using 3-DE in a 2-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with ICAML that exhibited mild mitral valve regurgitation. ICAML was initially assessed by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography. A diagnosis of congenital mitral regurgitation due to ICAML and understanding of the morphological structure of the valve was established based on the 3-DE findings.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This case series describes the clinical, parasitological, and serological follow-up of a cohort of eight adult Saint Bernard dogs with confirmed sarcoptic mange, treated orally with lotilaner. Dogs were evaluated initially and after 14 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months for skin lesions, pruritus severity, presence of parasites, and Sarcoptes-IgG levels. A serological indoor allergy panel (IgE) was obtained for seven dogs at day 0 and repeated 12 months later in five dogs to assess potential cross-reactivity between S. scabiei and environmental allergens. Lotilaner was administered to each dog according to the manufacturer's instructions and was repeated after one and two months without any concurrent therapeutic measure or modification of the husbandry conditions. Pruritus ceased after two weeks. The cutaneous score was reduced by 47%, and skin scrapings were negative for all but three animals. All skin scrapings were negative after one month. Lesions were absent after two months. Serological levels decreased gradually, but more slowly than the skin lesions, and two dogs out of six remained positive in the absence of skin lesions or symptoms. All dogs initially tested positive for dust mites and/or storage mites. The IgE titres remained unchanged 12 months later in the five tested dogs. This case report demonstrates the efficacy of lotilaner on scabies in a cohort of infested dogs under natural conditions and the potential antigenic cross-reaction of S. scabiei with house dust and storage mites.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Serological evidence in Mexico of the presence of this lentivirus was published in 1986. After that, studies revealed that SRLVs have a broad distribution in Mexico by detecting antibodies or/and molecular tests; however, a descriptive case of the disease has not been published. This work's objective was to describe the diagnosis of a case of OPP through lesion description, serology, and molecular test. The histopathological study showed that lymph follicular hyperplasia, interstitial pneumonia, and smooth muscle hyperplasia were presented. The serological test demonstrated specific antibodies against the Maedi-Visna virus, and PCR analysis demonstrated a positive outcome. These results include the criteria for the diagnosis of OPP. The serological prevalence of this disease is presented, contributing to the knowledge of the ecology of this disease in the world. This work is the first case report of ovine progressive pneumonia in Mexico and evidence of seroprevalence in sheep herds from Sonora, Mexico.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Although great apes appear to tolerate the parasite in the wild, they can develop a clinical form that can lead to death in captivity and the natural environment. At the Primatology Centre of the International Centre for Medical Research in Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon, we recorded 4 deaths of chimpanzees (Pan t. troglodytes) caused by Oesophagostomum spp. between 2015 and 2019. In each case, coprological analysis was positive for strongylid eggs and abdominal ultrasound revealed nodules about 4 cm in diameter on the intestinal and abdominal walls. Albendazole treatments administered by mouth in two doses of 400 mg six months apart resulted in the disappearance of the parasite in coprological samples but the chimpanzees still died. Autopsies carried out on all four chimpanzees revealed a rupture of the cysts and a discharge of pus into the abdomen in each case. We report surgical management involving the removal of Oesophagostomum spp. cysts from a chimpanzee following coprological analysis and abdominal ultrasound examination. Surgical exploration confirmed the fragility of the cystic walls, the rupture of which we avoided. This 5th new case of Oesophagostomum ssp. nodules recovered without complications following the operation and could rejoin his group. We suggest that surgical intervention should be considered in similar cases in captive primates, especially chimpanzees.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

The disorder was characterized by unilateral anomalies of the urinary tract (ectopic and dilated hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and renal dysplasia) associated with ipsilateral anomalies of the genital system (partial permanence of the duct of Wolff evolved into an epididymal-like structure and testicular agenesis). En bloc surgical excision of the complex of urogenital anomalies was performed with no complications during or after surgery.

Traditionally performed in rats, rabbits, cats, and dogs, CCLD in sheep provides an opportunity to study the pathology and treatment of joint instability in a species whose stifle better represents the equivalent human femorotibial joint. The surgical approaches for CCLD in sheep are variable and can result in inconsistent outcomes. Eight sheep underwent CCLD for use in a gene therapy study. We report this case in which six of the eight sheep were clinically diagnosed by pathognomonic signs and later confirmed by postmortem dissection, with injury of the peroneus tertius (PT) muscle. The PT plays a crucial role in the normal gait of large animals, including sheep. Injury to the PT results in failure of the reciprocal apparatus of the hind limb in which the hock can be extended during stifle flexion creating a varied gait and an indiscriminate increase in instability of the stifle and hock joints. Restricted movement postoperatively may provide decreased variability in surgical outcomes. Alternatively, increased stifle instability via CCLD coupled with PT transection or PT transection alone could potentially provide a superior model of stifle instability and OA development in sheep.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Gossypiboma is a rare surgical complication in small animals. The authors reported the laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of an abdominal gossypiboma and chronic draining fistula postopen ovariohysterectomy (OVH) unresponsive to medical treatment in a bitch. Case Presentation. The patient had undergone OVH and exploratory laparotomy in other veterinary practice 3 years previously. The animal, presenting a chronic fistula, was then referred to UFSM Veterinary Hospital. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a structure compatible with a granuloma. For the laparoscopic procedure, a 3-port (two at 11 mm; one at 6 mm) access was used. Adhesiolysis and mass removal were performed by blunt dissection and bipolar electrocoagulation. The fistula was treated by mobilising the omentum through it. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. The chronic wound showed first intention healing. The mass was composed of fibrous tissues surrounding one surgical gauze. Discussion and Conclusion. The removal of a retained surgical gauze in the abdomen by laparoscopy has already been described in medicine. However, a laparoscopic approach for treating a fistulous draining tract due to a gossypiboma has not been previously reported in dogs. Laparoscopic exploration of the fistula allowed the use of a pedicled omental flap through infected sites to control chronic infection. Laparoscopic surgery can be used to identify and treat abdominal gossypiboma in dogs, including those with chronic abdominal sinus.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A two-month-old, female, Aberdeen-Angus calf was presented for congenital cataracts and blindness in both eyes (OU). The dam had a reported history of visual defects (not specified) and had produced other affected calves (per owner history). Ophthalmic examination revealed mature bilateral cataracts, attenuation of the iridic granules, persistent pupillary membranes, and dyscoric pupils. Additionally, the calf had a poor body condition, prognathism, dome-shaped head, excessive nasal drainage, limb contracture, and fever. Histopathology of both eyes revealed lenticular degeneration (congenital cataracts), retinal dysplasia, and optic nerve hypoplasia. BVDV IHC detected antigen within only the left eye (OS), consisting of intrahistiocytic and endothelial immunoreactivity within the ciliary body, iris, and choroid. No BVDV immunoreactivity could be detected in the right eye (OD). This case highlights the unique ocular changes present in in utero BVDV infection of cattle with a different immunohistochemical staining profile than previously described.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To date, there are no available reports on the effects of PS in dogs with hypercholesterolemia with chronic heart failure (CHF). This case report demonstrates a successful long-term treatment plan using PS in a dog suffering from mitral insufficiency with hyperlipidemia. A 12-year-old, castrated male Chihuahua dog had mitral insufficiency with hyperlipidemia. The dog presented with symptoms of chronic coughing. PS was orally administered (1 mg/kg, SID) in addition to general treatment for mitral insufficiency. The follow-up period was 375 days. PS administration decreased the heart rate (HR), vertebral heart size (VHS), and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration of the dog. In addition, PS administration also improved chronic cardiac failure induced by mitral insufficiency and hyperlipidemia. This report suggests that PS can be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic for dogs with hypercholesterolemia with mitral insufficiency.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

They are the result of a distinct embryological phenomenon. Usually, they are of significant clinical relevance in horses, especially in tandem with ectopic tooth. Contrarily, supernumerary teeth or typical polyodontias usually have limited impact. In this case report, we describe the occurrence of a supernumerary first premolar (Triadan 105). Dissimilar to known scientific literature however was the formation of a cystic structure around the supernumerary tooth. Surgical removal of the dentigerous cyst is discussed, as are the possible causes for the formation of the cystic structure. Based on this case report, we suspect that the formation of a cystic structure may not be limited to atypical polyodontias, as they may also occur in supernumerary teeth.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Diagnostic testing revealed evidence of an acute hepatopathy and peritonitis. Given the dog's neurologic status, physical examination abnormalities, including a "tragic facial expression", and hyperlipidemia, there was concern for possible myxedema coma. A thyroid panel was consistent with hypothyroidism. The dog experienced respiratory arrest prior to initiation of therapy, and an autopsy confirmed the presence of subacute necrotizing cholangiohepatitis, marked atherosclerosis, and severe thyroid atrophy. These clinical and pathologic changes were supportive of myxedema coma.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Further investigations confirmed EHBO and revealed severe and previously unreported comorbidities. On initial examination, the cat was markedly icteric with a poor body condition score and severe muscle wasting. Serum chemistry and complete blood count showed evidence of cholestasis and anemia. Primary diagnostics and therapeutics targeted these abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound revealed peritoneal effusion, multifocal mixed echogenic hepatic and splenic foci, small intestinal thickening, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilation with evidence of obstruction. Peritoneal effusion cytology confirmed septic peritonitis. Hepatic and splenic cytology was consistent with lymphoma. Based on these results, euthanasia was elected by the owners of the animal. Necropsy confirmed the ultrasound diagnoses, septic peritoneal effusion associated with a duodenal perforation, multiorgan lymphoma, and common bile duct carcinoma. Flow cytometry classified the lymphoma as a double-negative phenotype of T-cell lymphoma (CD3+ and CD5+, but CD4- and CD8-) present in the duodenum and liver and suspected in the spleen which has previously not been reported in cats. This case report documents a cat with EHBO caused by multiple disease processes including a novel T-cell lymphoma phenotype, biliary carcinoma, duodenal perforation and septic abdomen, and choleliths, as well as inflammatory hepatobiliary disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Neoplasia represents one such example of conditions for which a dearth of information in these species exists. There has been increasing recognition of various types of neoplasms, including cutaneous tumors, particularly in ornamental fish; some of which may be related to environmental or to infectious causes. When excision of such tumors is indicated, surgical anaesthesia is required. However, special considerations may be warranted when employing immersion anaesthesia protocols in facultative air-breathing fish that can utilise the lungs for respiration. This anatomophysiological feature of Polypterus spp. may not only influence induction and maintenance of surgical anaesthesia but may theoretically have implications for drowning. Herein, we describe the management of a case of a rapidly growing gular neoplasm in a juvenile saddled bichir and considerations for surgical anaesthesia in this "lunged" species. Induction and maintenance of surgical anaesthesia using tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) in this species were found to be effective at significantly lower concentrations than standard recommended doses. Histopathological analysis identified the mass as a fibrosarcoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cutaneous fibrosarcoma in a bichir, representing the first report of neoplasia in Polypterus spp. and the first description of surgical anaesthesia in this amphibious fish.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
<Rec><Common><PMID>35198260</PMID>	<Type>Case Reports</Type>	<Title>Suspected Primary Spontaneous Asymptomatic Pneumothorax in a Cat.</Title>	<Abstract>Spontaneous pneumothorax (SPT) is a documented emergency of the respiratory tract condition classified as either primary or secondary based on the presence of underlying pulmonary conditions. All reported SPT in the feline literature are evaluated for respiratory clinical signs. Primary SPT without underlying pathology or without clinical signs is not reported in cats. This case report describes a 10-year-old domestic longhair cat that was referred for evaluation of chronic lethargy with severe azotemia and placement of a subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) system. Prior to presentation, the cat was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and treated medically with no resolution. Clinical examination under sedation revealed right-sided renomegaly. Thoracic radiographs revealed gas in the caudodorsal pleural space and concurrent pulmonary atelectasis. No respiratory clinical signs were present. Thoracic CT showed two pulmonary bullae, one located in the right caudal lung lobe and one in the cranial segment of the left cranial lung lobe. Abdominal ultrasound showed a right-sided ureteral obstruction. Medical management was elected for the spontaneous pneumothorax. A SUB was placed to address the ureteral obstruction; no complications were noted during recovery. The cat was free of clinical signs of respiratory disease after a follow-up time of nine months. This is the first reported case of a cat diagnosed with a nonclinical suspected primary spontaneous pneumothorax with no concurrent predisposing pulmonary pathology.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

In veterinary medicine, there is limited published information regarding abscessation of lymph nodes secondary to a neoplastic process. While more common in humans, there are only limited case reports available. Advanced imaging (computed tomography), cytology, surgical excision, and histopathology lead to the final diagnosis. Both dogs underwent surgical extirpation of the lymph nodes and adjuvant chemotherapy protocols. Six weeks postsurgical excision, dog one was euthanized due to quality-of-life concerns. The second dog successfully completed 18 treatments of radiation therapy and was still alive at 388 days postsurgical excision. At the time of manuscript submission, the second dog was doing well clinically.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

However, there have been no reports on the long-term application of the z-bar shoe during exercise training regimens. A 10-year-old mixed-breed show jumping pony presented with an occasional short stride and abnormal rhythm while turning during routine exercise for three months. Gait analysis conducted by trotting off on both hard and soft surfaces showed no lameness in the straight line on both types of surfaces. However, right forelimb lameness was detected with moderate and slight pain accompanying hard surface lunging in clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively. Sequential examination of uniaxial perineural anaesthesia confirmed that the pony suffered from medial palmar pain on the right foreleg. Mild distal border irregularity of the navicular bone was also observed radiographically. The z-bar shoe was designed relative to the palmar digital anaesthesia and subsequently applied on the lame leg. The pony demonstrated a marked reduction in lameness severity immediately post-Z-bar shoeing. Physical exercise was resumed a few days after the shoeing practice. The pony underwent routine exercise training while continuously fitting with the Z-bar shoe for 24 weeks without recurrent lameness or complications. Application of z-bar shoe showed the potential for long-term foot pain management during an exercise training regimen in a show jumping pony with uniaxial palmar pain.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

As her previous history indicated, the lameness started during the second gestation, especially in the early morning, and subsides after a few hours of sunrise. She was completely cured after giving her second birth and a similar condition reappeared from the 5[th] month of the third gestation until she gave birth. However, unexpectedly the disease aggravated after 2 days of parturition, and she was unable to walk and forced to stay indoors due to complete extension of the stifle joint. As a result, she was unable to lay down and maintained a permanent standing position for 2 months of aggravation. Clinical findings showed difficult mobilization of the right hind leg, which was locked in extension at the stifle joint, and the hoof was dragging on the floor. Based on history and clinical findings, upper fixation of the patella was diagnosed, and it was treated with median patellar desmotomy under local anesthetic infiltration. Finally, after the complete severing of the medial ligament and skin closure, the animal was able to walk normally, and the wound was healed uneventfully.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

This case series presents four camel calves (Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus) referred to a North American veterinary teaching hospital for diagnosis and management of failure of passive transfer. Diagnostics utilized included hematology, serum biochemistry, and immunologic methods as described for crias. Management included antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and plasma transfusion therapies. Three of the four calves survived to discharge, and common diagnostic practices such as evaluation of total solids, total protein, immunoglobulin G, and sodium sulfite appear to be correlate to passive transfer status in these four calves. Xenotransfusion with llama plasma was well tolerated by two calves, and xenotransfusion with bovine plasma was well tolerated by an additional calf in this study.

Eight days prior to admission, the dog ingested warfarin accidentally, exhibiting systemic clinical signs of intoxication 2 days later. Upon referral, the dog was nonambulatory with paretic thoracic limbs and plegia with absent nociception on pelvic limbs, spinal reflexes were decreased to absent in all four limbs, and urinary and faecal incontinence were noticed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the vertebral column revealed intramedullary lesions extending from the first cervical segments to the conus medullaris consistent with extensive intramedullary haemorrhages. Despite management with vitamin K1 and physiotherapy, 6 weeks later, improvement was limited to thoracic limb motor function, and euthanasia was elected.

Dogs had postoperative administration of 5 ml PPS injected into each elbow joint following elbow arthroscopy. Within 1-3 hours of administration, each dog experienced hemorrhage from arthroscopy incisions that was determined to be independent of surgical trauma given lack of hemorrhage intraoperatively. Pressure bandages were placed, and the hemorrhage and elevated coagulation parameters resolved 12-18 hours following intra-articular injection. No further intervention was required, and the dogs were discharged 20-26 hours postoperatively. The purpose of this case series is to describe 4 dogs who experienced transient and focal hemorrhage following off-label intra-articular administration of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS). While this case series is limited due to small number of cases, results following bilateral, intra-articular injection of PPS support a transient systemic coagulopathy. Though this report represents administration of PSS via a route and at doses beyond that recommended on the label, results suggest that administration of PSS in the manner described in this report should be avoided.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Clinically, open beak breathing, dropped wings, and pharyngeal and laryngeal hyperaemia were observed. Three birds were submitted for necropsy. Gross pathological evaluation revealed in all cases diffuses hyperaemia of the tracheal mucosa in association with mild emaciation and multiorgan congestion. Microscopically, diffuse epithelial hyperplasia of the trachea (n = 3) and diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria (n = 3) were observed. No lesions were reported in other organs. Based on reported clinical signs and lesions, Mycoplasma spp. were suspected, and molecular detection was performed on tracheal specimens leading to the identification of Mycoplasma columbinasale. Immunohistochemistry was subsequently performed to localize the microorganism within tissue lesions. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of Mycoplasma species on the tracheal epithelial cells of all birds. Following tylosin administration, complete resolution of the clinical condition and lack of recurrence of clinical signs were reported in the breeding farm. These findings suggest that M. columbinasale could potentially have a role in the respiratory disease and low mortality in domestic pigeons.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

A 9-year-old 35.6 kg (90 lb) female neutered German Shepherd dog was admitted due to progression of tetraparesis. The dog presented pyrexia, mild leukocytosis, and nonambulatory tetraparesis with decreased general proprioception and withdrawal in all the limbs, with the front limbs more severely affected. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2-weighted image (WI) hyperintense, contrast-enhancing lesion at the level of the C6-C8 spinal nerves, and epidural fat, suspected to be an infiltrative neoplasm. Medical treatments during hospitalization included glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and supportive care. Euthanasia was elected 4 days later due to financial constraints, despite clinical improvement. Postmortem findings revealed septic emboli (SE) in the epidural fat exiting the canal and following the tract of the spinal nerve roots and nerves. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was identified as the causative agent. Although the incidence of SE without severe systemic disease is considered low in dogs, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal intraspinal disease.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Computed tomography allowed the diagnosis of extramural ectopic ureter and unilateral renal agenesis. After the first neoureterocystostomy surgery, the dog had severe complications, such as hydroureter and hydronephrosis, so a second surgery was performed. A commercial ureteral stent was not an option, and it was decided to fabricate a homemade stent to avoid euthanasia. The stent used was a soft, DEHP-free PVC tube with a lumen of 3 &#215; 4.1 mm and a length of approximately 40 mm that connected the ureter to the urinary bladder.

Diagnostics identified a moderately distended bladder and mild dehydration. Preliminary lateral radiographs identified two metallic structures consistent with projectile pellets in the pelvic and perineal regions and no evidence of radiopaque uroliths. A tube cystostomy was performed, and a contrast urethrogram revealed one of the pellets in the perineal region was in proximity to the urethral obstruction. Subsequent radiography and ultrasound identified the pellet as being within the lumen of the urethra. Examination of the trichotomized skin revealed two scars, including a scar over the paralumbar fossa in the region of the urinary bladder suggestive of a projectile injury. The pellet was removed by a perineal urethrotomy. The patient was able to spontaneously urinate after urethrotomy, passed a tube cystostomy challenge two weeks after surgery, and was discharged. No complications were reported. While uncommon in the veterinary and comparative medical literature, clinicians should consider the potential for projectile pellets to migrate into the urinary tract after initial injury.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

Here, we report a dog and a cat that underwent an emergency tracheotomy for a foreign body in the proximal trachea. Case 1 was a dog with respiratory arrest caused by a large stone in the proximal trachea. The stone was immediately removed via tracheotomy without anesthesia. After intubation and ventilation under anesthesia, hypoxia persisted but improved after aspiration of 100 mL of bloody fluid from the lower trachea. Case 2 was a cat with dyspnea because of a proximal tracheal stone and increased radiopacity in the right lung. The stone was removed via tracheotomy after mask induction of anesthesia, followed by intubation and incision closure. Radiographs immediately after extubation showed worsened right lung atelectasis, alleviated by reintubation and positive pressure ventilation. Both patients recovered completely after surgery. An emergency tracheotomy may be indicated for a large foreign body in the proximal trachea. Additionally, concurrent conditions in the lower respiratory tract should be addressed.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>

To perform DSEK, a polycarbonate carrier and insertion device was designed for canine corneas that measure up to 15 mm in diameter. The tissue was loaded into the inserter prior to surgery with the endothelium facing inwards and the stroma facing the cartridge wall. From the cartridge, the graft was pulled into the eye using microforceps and an anterior chamber maintainer. We assessed preoperative endothelial cell count, postoperative corneal clearance, and graft adhesion. The donor was a two-year-old Airedale Terrier who died one day prior to surgery, with endothelial cell density of 3149 cells/mm[2]. One week after DSEK, the cornea began to clear, and pachymetry of the donor and graft total was 1410 microns. This improved to 800 microns at 4 months and continued improving in its clarity at the last postoperative visit 4 years after surgery. Discussion. We demonstrate the feasibility of conducting canine endothelial keratoplasty with a specially designed tissue delivery device and the potential of long-term corneal clearance after DSEK in canine eyes.</Abstract></Common><MeshTermList /></Rec>
